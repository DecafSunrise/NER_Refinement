0,0,09-12-16 18:31,2016,12,9,Lee Drutman,We should take concerns about the health of liberal democracy seriously,"This post is part of Polyarchy, an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America, a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices. Imagine you are an otherwise healthy 30-something who starts feeling weird. You are sometimes short of breath. You get migraines. Your feet start to swell a little. But otherwise, everything seems fine. You go to the doctor. The doctor runs some tests. She tells you, It's probably nothing, but these could be signs of a coming heart attack. You push for more certainty, but the doctor tells you she's not sure. The human body is a complex system. You're young and otherwise pretty healthy. There could be plenty of other explanations for what you're feeling. But it is a little worrying. So just to be on the safe side, maybe you should reduce the stress in your life and eat a healthier diet. What would you do? If you're a sensible person, you'd probably err on the side of precaution. Sure, it might be nothing to worry about, and the likelihood of a heart attack in your 30s might be low. But even a low chance is a low chance of something possibly fatal. Why take a chance, especially when the recommendations — less stress, healthier diet — are good for you either way? I offer this parable as a way of thinking about the debate that's emerged over the past two weeks in response to Amanda Taub's New York Times article profiling new findings by Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk — findings that raise alarms about the fact that younger people have, over time, become less and less likely to say in surveys that it is ""essential"" to live in a democracy. Rather than share the sense of alarm, however, several critics have jumped on Foa and Mounk for misinterpreting the data and generating unnecessary panic. Political scientist Erik Voeten, for example, argued that their analysis is misleading: ""The article by Mounk and Foa does document some small shifts in opinion on related issues. But these aren't nearly as dramatic as the New York Times graph suggests."" Similarly, Wonkblog's Jeff Guo reanalyzed the data and argued that it is ""far less alarming than it seems."" Foa and Mounk have responded, drawing on more analysis from their forthcoming Journal of Democracy article, which also documents increasing support among young people for ""a strong leader"" and rising support for extremism. Voeten, however, remains unimpressed, and now has more charts here suggesting the shifts are far less significant than Foa and Mounk make them out to be. ""And,"" he argues, ""it's dangerous too to tell the world that people are now ready to accept nondemocratic governance."" For those who want to argue over how to interpret the data, you should follow the hyperlinks above. There are very reasonable points of disagreement. I don't have much to add to that debate here, other than to observe that it's very rare that data is unambiguous about important societal shifts before those shifts actually occur. When the data is unambiguous, it is almost always too late to do anything. The only sure sign of having a heart attack is, well, having a heart attack. Similarly, the only sure sign of a democratic collapse is, well, a democratic collapse. And whatever you think of the data analysis, there is also a mounting series of actual real-world election results that are hard to explain if support for liberal democracy is thriving. In deciding how seriously to take these findings, it's also worth asking what we would do differently if we took Foa and Mounk's findings seriously. How would we collectively respond? And what would be the consequences? For one, we'd probably invest in a lot more civic education, so that the next generation learns the basics of liberal democracy and understands why it's a better system than authoritarian rule. This seems like a good idea regardless. Similarly, we might collectively invest considerable resources in making a strong public case for liberal democracy. We might also try to figure out ways to make our public institutions do more outreach to citizens to make sure they feel engaged in their democracy, and think hard about building up intermediary institutions that help people feel as though their voices are represented and taken seriously. Again, these seem like things we should be doing regardless, like reducing stress or improving the health of our diets. In my heart attack parable, if the doctor had told you that the only way to prevent a future heart attack would be to give up your job and your social life and spend the next year on strict bed rest eating only kale and chia seed salads, you might want to be a little more certain that you really were at high risk for a heart attack. After all, taking the risk seriously would impose a heavy cost on you. Other recent crises offer some examples of cases where key decision-makers did ignore warning signs, because taking those signs seriously would have imposed significant costs on them. For example, in the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, warnings were ignored because the financial industry had staked considerable investments and product lines on the myth that housing values would go up forever. To admit that housing was overvalued and that securitized mortgages were riskier than advertised would have cost investment banks dearly. But eventually, reality caught up with them, and the resulting damage was far worse than it would have been if we had paid attention to the early warning signs. Similarly, many carbon-intensive industries and fossil fuel producers pushed back on findings of climate change because taking those findings seriously would force significant changes in their industries. As a result, these industries funded doubt and uncertainty. The problem has since gotten much worse, and it has become harder to take effective action. The early scientists may have been alarmist. But we'd be in much better shape if we had listened to them. I would be more comforted if I could be certain that Voeten is right and Foa and Mounk are wrong. Maybe there is indeed nothing to worry about. But given the risks, as well as the recent string of election results, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Like the threat of a heart attack, the threat of autocracy or military rule replacing liberal democracy is pretty serious, and very difficult to recover from. I don't want to take a chance. Especially when the preventive medicine consists of things we should probably be doing anyway.",https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/12/9/13898340/democracy-warning-signs,,Vox
1,1,07-10-16 21:26,2016,10,7,Scott Davis,Colts GM Ryan Grigson says Andrew Luck's contract makes it difficult to build the team," The Indianapolis Colts made Andrew Luck the highest-paid player in NFL history this offseason with a five-year, $122-million contract with $89 million guaranteed. However, they're already finding that Luck's contract is inhibiting their ability to address weaknesses on other parts of the roster, particularly on defense. On Friday, Colts GM Ryan Grigson, who is under fire for the Colts 1-3 start, said that it's difficult to build up the team's defense with Luck making so much money. According to Keefer, Grigson did point out that the Colts still have young talent they're hoping to develop on defense. However, blaming Luck's contract — which the Colts gave him — for having a weak defense (30th in defensive DVOA) is not accurate. As others have pointed out, last year's Denver Broncos paid Peyton Manning $15 million in base salary while also boasting an elite defense. Luck also takes up $18.4 million against the salary cap this year, less than $1 million more than Manning did a year ago ($17.5 million). Much of this comes from drafting successfully, which the Colts have not done as well as elite teams like the Broncos or the Patriots, for instance. Now, with the Colts handcuffed to Luck's contract, drafting is going to become especially important, as will the use of whatever money they have in free agency. It's certainly possible to build a good defense with a high-paid quarterback, but if the Colts felt that paying Luck such a high sum of money would be difficult, perhaps they should have reconsidered what the final numbers.

3,3,27-06-19 00:00,2019,6,27,,France's Sarkozy reveals his 'Passions' but insists no come-back on cards,"PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy published a new memoir on Thursday but was quick to dismiss speculation he might return to politics to rescue his old center-right party, which has shed support since President Emmanuel Macron stormed to power.  Entitled “Passions”, the autobiography documents Sarkozy’s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities. While at the Elysee, he met and married former model Carla Bruni.  “Passions” is released as France’s center-right fights for survival two years after President Emmanuel Macron’s election win dynamited the political landscape.  Sarkozy’s old party, Les Republicains, is locked in infighting and struggling to find direction, squeezed by Macron’s centrist party and the far right.  “The book is a political one, it does not announce my return,” Sarkozy told magazine Le Point. “I neither want nor can get involved in a partisan debate. That would sew confusion and division. There is no need for that. It would be misplaced.”  Nonetheless, each new appearance by the last unifying figure of the French right is closely followed - fearfully by those wary of the return of a big-name rival, and hopefully by those who long for Sarkozy’s political reincarnation.  Sarkozy has retired twice from politics: the first time after he lost his re-election bid in 2012. He returned to lead his party in 2014 only to quit again after he failed to win his party’s ticket to run for president in 2017.  Les Republicains are again without a leader after Laurent Wauquiez stepped down following the party’s dismal showing in May’s European election.  Even if Sarkozy were to return to frontline politics, he would struggle to put to one side multiple investigations, including into the financing of his re-election bid.   This month he learnt he must stand trial on charges of corruption and influence peddling in relation to allegations that he offered a judge a promotion in return for information on a parallel investigation.  Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing.

A so-called tiered deposit rate would mean banks are exempted in part from paying the ECB’s 0.40 percent annual charge on their excess reserves, boosting their profits as they struggle with an unexpected growth slowdown  “We would have to consider whether a tiering system is needed,” Coeure said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Today the prevailing view in the Governing Council is that it is not, but we also agree that it deserves further reflection.”  Reporting by Michelle Martin

Air Force Brigade General Miguel Sisco Mora was arrested Friday afternoon in a parking lot in Guatire, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the capital Caracas, his daughter Stephanie Sisco said. Navy Corvette Captain Rafael Costa was detained on Friday in nearby Guarenas, according to his wife Waleska Perez.  “We demand that the government provide us with information about his whereabouts,” Stephanie Sisco wrote on Twitter on Saturday.   The arrests come nearly two months after a failed uprising against Maduro called by opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency and has called on the armed forces to join his cause.  They also come on the heels of a visit to Venezuela by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who on Friday called on Maduro to release prisoners arrested for peacefully protesting. Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been widely denounced as illegitimate, said he would take the U.N.’s concerns seriously.  Human rights group Penal Forum had previously said that two retired Air Force colonels had been arrested in Caracas on Friday afternoon while two high ranking officials from Venezuela’s CICPC forensic police unit were arrested in Guatire, according to human rights lawyer Tamara Suju.  Neither Venezuela’s Information Ministry nor the Chief Prosecutor’s office responded to requests for comment on the six detentions on Sunday.  According to Penal Forum, some 700 people are detained for political reasons in Venezuela, including about 100 members of the military.   Maduro’s government has denied it holds political prisoners, and frequently accuses the opposition of fomenting violence. Maduro refers to Guaido as a puppet of the United States seeking to oust him in a coup.

7,7,02-05-18 17:09,2018,5,2,Caroline Williams,You Can Trick Your Brain Into Being More Focused,"If only every day could be like this. You can’t put your finger on why: Maybe you had just the right amount of sleep. Maybe the stars are somehow aligned in your favor. Whatever the reason, you’re cooking on gas. Hours fly by like minutes, you’re feeling great, and before you know it it’s 5:30 pm and your to-do list is done.  This feeling of ‘flow’ or being ‘in the zone’ is something that most of us have experienced at some point or other—although not as often as we might like. It’s a mental state that elite athletes seem to have at their beck and call. For us mere mortals, though, it hardly ever shows up when we need it. Since the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi first described the zone (which he called ‘flow’) in 1975, neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what it is and how to make it show up on demand. Yet as they close in on the secrets of the zone, another truth has emerged: What we think of as  the zone is actually one of many mental states that a person can be in, each of which works for a particular kind of thinking. Here’s how to master not just one of them, but several.   The Flow ZoneTo understand when other states might work better, it makes sense to first consider what we know about this, the original ‘zone.' One thing we definitely know is that it feels great: Csíkszentmihályi describes it as the ‘optimal experience’ in which we can achieve true happiness.  One explanation for why it happens—and why it feels so good—is that it represents a perfect match between activity in brain networks involved in attention and the reward circuitry, which process pleasure. When different networks synchronize their activity—like two pendulums swinging in time—it makes the business of thinking run a little more smoothly, which explains why this particular zone feels effortless when you’re in it.  Even Csíkszentmihályi admits, however, that it’s not easy to achieve. “Flow is difficult to maintain for any length of time without at least momentary interruptions,” he wrote—and that was in the 1970s, before smartphones came along and took what was left of our attention span. So how best to get into the flow? One suggestion is that, rather than screwing up your eyes and trying to force yourself to concentrate, it might work better to do the opposite: Take your foot off the mental gas a little.  This finding came out of brain imaging experiments by cognitive neuroscientists Mike Esterman and Joe DeGutis of the Boston Attention and Learning Lab in Massachusetts. They measured activity in the default mode network (DMN) a collection of brain regions that gear up when we are not thinking of anything in particular. They compared this to activity in the dorsal attention network, which keeps us focused on one thing, and watched how the two fluctuated over time when people were asked to do a boring, repetitive task.  Surprisingly, they found that the best way to sustain concentration wasn’t to cut out DMN activity altogether, but to allow it to carry on as a low-level background hum. In real terms, that means keeping your mind on a long leash: letting it wander a little, before gently bringing it back to heel.  ""If you're devoting all of your resources to a task you will likely be fighting your natural tendency to mind wander. This could actually make sustaining attention more effortful and challenging. If you try too hard you ay actually perform worse work over time,"" DeGutis says.  No matter how much you love your work, paying attention for long periods is hard mental work. By relaxing a little, it makes it easier to find the crucial balance of effort and enjoyment that nudges us into the flow. Rather than trying so hard that we set ourselves up to fail, the solution could simply be to stop beating ourselves up. More from Tonic: The Slow ZoneTime doesn’t only fly when you’re in the flow. It also flies when a deadline is heading your way and you haven’t quite hit your stride. If time is running short and the flow feels a million miles away, all is not lost. You still have time to master the slow zone.  For better or worse, strong emotions distract us from the passage of time, giving the illusion that it is zipping past unusually quickly. If it’s too difficult to take the emotion out of the equation (that deadline is coming whether you like it or not), the next best thing is to change the way your brain processes the passage of time, to mentally buy yourself a little more.  It sounds too good to be true, but Marc Wittmann, a psychologist at the Institute for Frontier Areas in Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany, and author of  Felt Time, has a couple of suggestions on how it could be done. Wittmann believes that our brains count time by tuning into the rhythms of the body—the regular ticks of our heartbeat, breathing and so on. He calls this ‘body time’ and points to a region of the brain called the insula, which keeps track of our physical and emotional state, as key to this process.  “My idea is that you are attending to yourself, to your bodily self, your mental self and that is how you attend to time,” Wittman says.  In theory, then, if you can change the information that the insula receives, you might be able to control how you perceive time. One thing Wittman suggests is to speed up your bodily signals by exercising. When you stop, the body’s signals will gradually slow down to baseline, slowing your perception of time as it does so.  “Say I go jogging for an hour and then I’m calm down but still feel very active,"" Wittman says. ""I feel that everything is happening much slower because my body is much more activated and I feel myself much more intensely."" Another option is to direct your attention to the here and now, purposefully focusing on the fine details of your surroundings, thoughts or your mental state. A 10-minute mindfulness meditation will help haul your focus back to the here and now and, by slowing your breathing rate, will also slow down your body signals. Both should make time slow to a much more manageable speed. Wittman’s experiments suggest that expert meditators are able to stretch their perception of a moment by 25 percent, which makes all that sitting around seem well worth the investment of time, no matter how little you have to play with.  The 'Zoned Out' ZoneGiven all the effort we spend trying to get into the zone it might seem strange to actively try to stay out of it. But there are some mental skills that work better when you’re just a little bit away with the fairies. Creativity is one of them. Research by Evangelia Chrysikou at the University of Kansas has found that using brain stimulation to temporarily reduce activity in part of the prefrontal cortex (the region of the brain behind the forehead), increased the number of creative uses for everyday objects that people were able to come up with. This works because the job of the prefrontal cortex is to narrow down the possible thoughts and behaviors that are suitable in any given situation. This is a crucial mental shortcut because it vastly reduces the time we need to make decisions about what to do or say next. The downside—at least for our creative juices—is that it also reduces the scope of our ideas, making blue sky thinking that much more difficult.  So ideally, the right zone to come up with new ideas is one in which activity in the prefrontal cortex is dialled down a little—a state known as transient hypofrontality. “It’s about using the right tool for the right task. If you want to look for ideas then hypofrontal zoning out will help you,” Chrysikou says. There is more than one way to reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex. Tiredness works particularly well, so working when you are naturally at your least alert (morning for night owls, late in the day for morning folk and after lunch for just about everybody) is definitely worth a try. A boozy drink does something similar, according to actual studies on drunk students. And if all else fails, sitting in a quiet and/or dark room can’t help but set the mind wandering to who knows where. However you manage it, it’s worth remembering that while mindfulness is all the rage at the moment, when you want to think creatively, mindlessness is a much better tool for the job. Go on, zone out—your brain will thank you. But remember to come back into the room at some point to make sure that your ideas aren't too bonkers. ""To decide which idea works best, prefrontal involvement is necessary,"" Chrysikou says.  The Cramming ZoneThere’s nothing like a deadline to focus the mind. It’s almost what the fight/flight response was designed for: A short burst of adrenaline narrows focus to help you ignore everything except the life-and-death task at hand. The trouble is, if a period of stress goes on too long, or happens too often, the whole system breaks down, focus scatters, and takes your ability to concentrate with it.  This is partly because high doses of stress hormones, particularly noradrenaline, interferes with focus by binding to sites in the prefrontal cortex, stopping it from working effectively. Another job of the prefrontal cortex is to help us resist impulses that aren’t necessarily helpful for our long-term goals, which explains why stress can leave you mainlining down tea and biscuits when you should be doing some work.  So, what to do when you are stressed and distracted but need to focus  now? One option is—strangely—to make whatever you are doing more difficult to concentrate on. According to load theory, the brainchild of psychologist Nilli Lavie at University College London, the brain only has a limited amount of processing power to use on making sense of the world around us. Her experiments have shown that if you add deliberate distractions to what you are trying to concentrate on (flashing images, colorful borders, background noise) it can actually help you focus. This is because processing these distractions uses up the brain’s processing power, leaving no room to process either external distractions—or your own internal excuses.

Experts told VICE News that Chinese state media’s adoption of the term appears to directly borrow from the U.S. president. Referring to the state-run Xinhua news agency report, Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said that “Xinhua’s usage of this term should be attributed to Trump.” China is just the latest country to adopt Trump’s favorite buzzword to discredit unfavorable reports; Russia and Iran have also begun using the term to dismiss critical coverage. The term “is obviously spreading among countries,” said Zhang. In his short political career, Donald Trump has made a habit of dismissing unfavorable media reports as “fake news.” Now it seems Beijing is taking a page from his playbook, using the term to attempt to discredit foreign media reports on Thursday that claimed a prominent human rights lawyer was tortured in government custody.

Referring to the state-run Xinhua news agency report, Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said that “Xinhua’s usage of this term should be attributed to Trump.” China is just the latest country to adopt Trump’s favorite buzzword to discredit unfavorable reports; Russia and Iran have also begun using the term to dismiss critical coverage. The term “is obviously spreading among countries,” said Zhang. Xinhua, the mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, published an article Thursday describing international media reports on the alleged torture of Chinese attorney Xie Yang as “nothing but cleverly orchestrated lies.” “The stories were essentially fake news,” read the article. Fake news – false online reports presented as legitimate news stories – emerged as an issue during last year’s U.S. presidential election, and the rise of deliberately misleading stories is increasingly proving to be a problem in several other countries. But the term has been gradually debased as it is used more and more by political actors seeking to discredit critical coverage or deflect uncomfortable realities. Trump has been the most high-profile adopter of the term, regularly wielding it as an insult to bash any journalism that paints his administration in an unflattering light. The most recent claim of “fake news” from the Chinese centers around the story of Xie, a 45-year-old attorney who has represented clients in many politically sensitive cases. He was detained in the Chinese province of Hunan in July 2015 at the start of an ongoing crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists, and has yet to be released. Late last year reports emerged, sourced to transcripts of interviews with Xie’s lawyers, alleging that he had been subjected to threats and violence in custody – with the aim of forcing him to confess to political crimes. Xie’s claims were reported by outlets such as the The New York Times – regularly accused by Trump of peddling “fake news” – and The Guardian, which said that while the allegations could not be verified, they were consistent with previously documented abuses in custody. The Xinhua article Thursday reported that an “independent team” set up by officials to investigate the torture reports had interviewed Xie and his fellow inmates and established that the alleged abuses did not happen. It claimed the torture allegations had been cooked up by Jiang Tianyong, another prominent human rights lawyer who has been detained since visiting Xie’s relatives in November, and who it said had encouraged Xie’s wife to publicize the claims. The torture claims were designed “to cater to the tastes of Western institutions and media organizations, and to use public opinion to pressure police and smear the Chinese government,” Xinhua said. Human rights groups say that confessions to political crimes made by detained activists in China are typically made under duress. Experts contacted by VICE News said that while Chinese state media had long accused Western news outlets of bias against China, the use of the term “fake news” was a recent development. “I would argue that their use of this term seems to be influenced by Trump’s use of the term to discredit major Western media outlets,” said Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International. According to the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, Xie has been indicted on charges of “inciting subversion of state power,” and “disrupting court order.” Xie’s lawyer, Chen Jiangang, told Reuters Thursday that his client’s account of torture was genuine, saying that Xie had made the same claims to him.",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xwvj7j/china-is-dismissing-unfavorable-media-reports-as-fake-because-thats-what-trump-does,,Vice News

In February, Warren announced that she would swear off high-dollar fundraisers and phone calls with wealthy donors during the 2020 Democratic primary. In a Medium post announcing the decision, she said she wanted to make sure “everybody who supports my campaign is treated equally, regardless of how much they can afford to give.” Some critics emerged, arguing that such a maneuver was a risky disarmament against a well-funded Republican machine. Some suggested it might be a way for her to explain lower-than-expected fundraising. The New York Times reported that the decision was controversial even within her campaign. But Warren has stuck with it. What Warren is doing here is pretty straightforward: When a small-dollar donor gives money to her campaign through her website, they’re asked for some basic information, including their name, address, and phone number. That information comes in and her campaign picks out donors for her to call and thank. Her campaign has put out videos of her making the calls, of which it says she has made hundreds. She generally calls in the evenings, though sometimes it’s at other times of the day, and speaks with people for a few minutes. For most candidates, “call time” means calling wealthy donors and asking for money. Not me. I’m spending “call time” thanking small-dollar, grassroots donors who give what they can. Chip in what you can, and you might get a call from me to say thank you. Link in bio. A post shared by Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Apr 29, 2019 at 6:51am PDT What makes this feel more organic and effective is the declarations of the people she’s calling announcing what’s happened and expressing their excitement. A lot of them are doing it on social media, and chances are those people are also telling their family and friends about getting a call from Liz. “It’s guerrilla marketing in a way — the humblebragging from supporters about getting a call feels organic and lends credibility to her claim that she’s prioritizing grassroots supporters. It emphasizes her relatability and down-to-earth nature, and generates viral moments,” Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, an organization that supports young candidates running for office, told me. One person wrote a diary post for Daily Kos talking about the Warren call experience. Litman added that beyond the candidate, and sometimes even more so, the best messengers to most voters are their friends and family. “[Warren] is arming folks with personal anecdotes to convince friends and family, and social media lets those moments spread far and wide,” she said. A Democratic strategist working for a rival 2020 Democratic campaign concurred. “It’s super savvy and a clever way of turning the fundraising process, which justifiably seems cold and cynical to most voters, into a way to showcase her authenticity and the grassroots energy behind her campaign,” the strategist said in an email. Idk if y’all heard but Elizabeth Warren called me today to thank me for supporting her campaign and my WHOLE LIFE WAS MADE! @ewarren you are the absolute COOLEST! pic.twitter.com/9ODwffMG9A Oh my god. Elizabeth Warren called me to thank me for donating to her campaign a whole month ago and I just found out I missed her call. I just listened to her voicemail right now. WHYYYY. Please call me back @ewarren! I’m gonna donate again tomorrow OMG. I was in meeting this morning when @ewarren called & left this message to thank me for contributing to her campaign. I'm in shock. Thanks for the call, Senator, and #ImAllIn. #LetsDoThis. #Warren2020. pic.twitter.com/w6ylSZcnCQ Warren’s calls have also gotten others online wondering why they haven’t received a call. And it could be inspiring FOMO and getting others to donate in hopes of hearing from the senator. She called me. It was such a shock! But completely fun and genuine Wait, why hasn't @SenWarren called me yet? I'm a COMPLETE MESS. 13-40s: my crush hasn’t called me 40+: neither my crush nor Elizabeth Warren has called me This is also a way for Warren to remind people about her commitment to steering clear of high-dollar fundraisers and calls to major donors. She has staked much of her career — and her campaign — on casting herself as being on the side of the little guy and up against Wall Street, big money, and corporate interests. She’s hosting “pop-up” meetings where a select group of supporters in certain areas get invited to meet her in small settings. She’s done those events in places such as Denver, Brooklyn and Harlem, and Alabama. Those pop-up gatherings, along with the calls, reiterate her no-big-money point. “It’s definitely cheesy, but in a way that feels true to her and that over the long haul will absolutely pay off,” Litman said. Since announcing her presidential bid, Warren has rolled out a litany of policy proposals on a wide range of issues, including abortion, tech consolidation, agriculture reform, opioids, and the revolving door at the Pentagon. She is outpacing her fellow 2020 contenders in terms of policy. And in calls with supporters, she appears to be reminding them of it. (When supporters don’t pick up, she leaves a message.) And I thought this day couldn't get any better! I had a great convo w/ @ewarren about abortion rights, gerrymandering & the stacking of state legislatures n AL, GA, etc. She LISTENED to me talk about how I feel helpless as a CA voter to help my sisters in other states... On the phone with Elizabeth Warren who called to thank us for our campaign support, AND, we talked a few minutes about child care policy. VERY IMPRESSED WITH HER. pic.twitter.com/Qe6MzKfIhg Jessica Ellis, a Los Angeles-based writer whom Warren called on Monday, told me that Warren thanked her for her support and discussed her proposed wealth tax, which would put a small tax on Americans with a net worth of more than $50 million. She also talked about her student debt plan, which would cancel debt for millions of Americans and invest in debt-free college. (She says she would pay for that with the wealth tax.) “She emphasized that she really, truly believed she could win, and that if she does, she knows she can address our worst problems,” Ellis said. Ellis told Warren she first saw her on The Daily Show in 2009, years before she was elected to the Senate, when Ellis was watching with her mother. “We both said, ‘That woman needs to be president,’” Ellis said. “She laughed and told me to send my mom her best.” update: it wasn’t",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/22/18635846/elizabeth-warren-twitter-calls-ashley-nicole-black,,Vox
11,11,23-06-19 00:00,2019,6,23,"Jessica DiNapoli, Harry Brumpton",Hudson's Bay's chairman's buyout bid pits retail versus real estate,"(Reuters) - The success of Hudson’s Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker’s $1.3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner, corporate governance experts and analysts said.  Much of Hudson’s Bay’s value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.  Baker’s buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson’s Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement.   However, some of the minority shareholders, including hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, say they value the company’s assets at between C$28 and C$33 per share. Hudson’s Bay shares ended trading on Friday at C$9.73, above the C$9.45 offer price, as investors bet on a sweetened bid.  The big valuation gap is due to disagreements over how much of Hudson’s Bay’s prime real estate can be divested while keeping it operational. Selling off property raises cash but also makes it more financially burdensome for the company to rent the space for the stores it operates. As a result, it would likely close stores, and its retail footprint would begin to shrink.  “There is judgment to be exercised on the valuation, which can always be challenging,” said Catherine McCall, the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, an organization representing institutional shareholders in Canadian public companies.  Hudson’s Bay operates 39 stores under its Saks Fifth Avenue brand, 133 stores under its Saks OFF 5th brand, more than 40 stores under the Lord + Taylor banner, 90 Hudson’s Bay department stores, as well as 37 stores in Canada which the company plans to close this year under the Home Outfitters brand.   Hudson’s Bay’s trophy asset is the Saks Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan, which this year completed a $250 million renovation.  Hudson’s Bay’s most recent public estimate for the value of its real estate was in September 2018, when CEO Helena Foulkes pegged it at $28 per share. Baker has offered about a third of that because he argues that the company would have to all but liquidate to achieve all the real estate value.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has been hired by a Hudson’s Bay board committee to independently evaluate the take-private deal, will recommend whether the company should accept the offer as fair, or reject it and try to negotiate further.   The board committee excludes representatives of Baker’s buyout consortium and is granted power to prevent any deal, even if the prospective acquirers otherwise control the company. In an illustration of this, a special board committee sank the hopes of Nordstrom Inc’s founding family group last year to take the U.S. department store operator private, after it rejected their $8.4 billion offer.  The methodology Toronto-Dominion Bank uses to value the bid for Hudson’s Bay will be key to the outcome and will be scrutinized heavily by shareholders. The bank will likely be assessing how comparable companies’ shares trade, research similar deals and consider how much a financial buyer like a private equity firm would pay, said Andrey Golubov, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto.  “It’s not done just to justify the offer. That said, valuation is not a science,” Golubov said.   Hudson’s Bay declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Baker’s buyout consortium. Spokespeople for TD Bank did not respond to requests for comment.  Sale lease-back arrangements in which retailers sell their properties and become tenants in their stores have become increasingly popular in the last few years as the downturn in brick-and-mortar retail brought about by the rise of internet shopping has put pressure on retailers to raise cash.  However, some retailers resist them because they view the  rent obligation as burdensome, a stance that often attracts investor criticism. Macy’s Inc for example, another department store operator, was pressured by hedge fund Starboard Value LP three years ago to do more to cash out on its real estate.   Even if Toronto-Dominion Bank blesses an offer from Baker’s consortium and the board committee negotiating a deal approves it, the acquisition still faces some hurdles.  A majority of the shareholders who are not affiliated with the buyout consortium have to vote for it, accounting for about 21.5 percent of the company’s shareholder base. Opponents could still challenge the deal in court when the company seeks approval for it before a judge under the Canada Business Corporations Act.   But successful legal challenges of deals that have followed the process for management buyouts outlined by the Ontario Securities Commission, as Hudson’s Bay is seeking to do, are rare.  “Most of these deals get done once they get board approval and a transaction agreement gets signed,” said Jeremy Fraiberg, chair of the mergers and acquisitions group at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

15,15,08-09-16 15:40,2016,9,8,Jeff Stein,Nancy Pelosi says a Clinton landslide could put the House in play. The math backs her up.,"Nancy Pelosi is getting visions of reclaiming her House gavel. In an interview published by Politico on Thursday, the House minority leader said she is becoming increasingly optimistic that the Democratic Party might take back the House of Representatives in November. They’ll need to flip 30 seats controlled by the Republicans to do so. “I thought in December I would’ve told you we’d win 20 seats, left to our own devices,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. “(But) seeing the behavior of the [GOP] presidential candidates right after that when the debates [happened], I became even more optimistic because they were so pathetic. … Since then, I think anything is possible.” Most observers think Democrats are unlikely to flip the House. But Pelosi suggested a Hillary Clinton landslide might carry House Democrats to power with her. “If Hillary were to win 54-46, oh my God. It’s all over. If it's 53-47, and I think that’s in the realm of possibility ... that’s a big deal,” Pelosi told Politico. “Five or more [percentage points] is a big deal.” Pelosi’s projections might sound optimistic, but they’re not that far outside the mainstream. Last month, I spoke to Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, who offered a similar theory. Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump has narrowed from late August from 8 points to around 3 points, so a 5-point win seems increasingly unlikely. But if Clinton can somehow reopen her big lead, the House really might be on the table. Here’s why. Get a district to vote for your party’s presidential nominee and your party will also probably win its House seat. That’s not an ironclad rule, but it’s a pretty good indicator — in 2012, only 6 percent of districts that voted for Barack Obama voted a Republican into the House. This is the key to understanding why Skelley thinks a 6-point Clinton win could put the House in play. That kind of national victory would likely mean 50 House districts currently controlled by Republicans would vote for Clinton — therefore suggesting they have a good shot of also going blue at the House level. Of course, a Clinton win in these 50 districts wouldn’t guarantee House Democrats will pick up all of those seats. (Many are held by powerful or longstanding Republican incumbents who are well-funded and enjoy good reputations at home.) But it does mean that Democrats could lose 40 percent of the House races in districts won by Clinton and still take back control of the House. Right now Clinton isn’t projected to win by nearly that much. Averages of all the major polling firms compiled by both RealClearPolitics and the Huffington Post currently put Her lead right around the 3-point mark; she’d need that to come up to where it was after the Democratic convention, which is unlikely but not impossible. ""A 6-point lead would help create the conditions for Clinton to pull the Democrats over the finish line to take the House,"" Skelley says. ""It doesn’t mean they would, of course, but it begins looking really possible."" How does Skelley figure that a 6-point Clinton win would have Democrats winning 50 GOP-controlled House districts? His model begins by assuming that the distribution of the national popular vote margin to the congressional districts will be exactly the same in 2016 as it was in 2012. This may be best illustrated by an example: In 2012, Obama won the popular vote total by 4 percentage points. In Skelley’s model, a 4-point Clinton win would mean she’d also win and lose every congressional district by the exact same amount Obama did. (Of course, this is bound to be wrong in some places — the distribution of Clinton’s vote share certainly won’t be an exact replica of Obama’s. But since there’s no way of knowing exactly how the popular vote will vary by House district from 2012, it’s a useful gauge of what might happen.) This is why a 4-point Clinton win probably wouldn’t flip the House. Obama’s 4-point win over Romney gave him victories in just 28 congressional seats currently controlled by Republicans. That wouldn’t be enough — remember, Democrats need a full 30 to take back the House. But what happens if Clinton expands on Obama’s national vote margin? Since Skelley’s model assumes the national vote share will be evenly distributed, every additional point in the national vote total translates into an additional point for each congressional district. House seats where Democrats tied or lost in 2012 become places where they win at the presidential level in 2016. If Clinton wins by 5 points, according to Skelley, she’d be projected to win in 39 House seats now run by Republicans. That would theoretically put the House in play but would give Democrats very little margin for error. But if she wins by a full 6 points, then 50 seats slide over to the Democratic column — at least at the presidential level, and maybe for the House as well. Now, Skelley isn’t the only close election watcher who is suggesting the House really might be in play. Princeton professor and election guru Sam Wang tried to take another stab at this question by looking at the margin by which Democrats would need to win the popular vote to win the House and then trying to figure out where the popular vote currently appears to be headed. What he found should encourage Democrats. With the exception of just two elections, he found that Democrats have always won back the House when they’ve won the ""two-party vote"" (voting that excludes third parties): Data from mid-August suggested that they’re on track to do just that. Wang looked at results from something called the ""generic ballot"" — it asks voters to pick between the two parties, regardless of candidates — as well as the national presidential polling. ""If the election were held today, House Democratic candidates would win the popular vote by 5 to 8 percent,"" Wang said. ""Judging from the last few cycles, that level of public opinion appears to be right on the edge of being enough to give Democrats control of the House."" Still, many of the current projections don’t have the Democrats riding a massive blue wave. The widely respected Cook Political Report, for instance, thinks the party is only on track to nab an additional 16 seats. The Cook Political Report thinks only 33 seats are vulnerable at all, meaning Democrats would have to win 90 percent of all of the competitive races to pull this off. In late August, Emory professor Alan Abramowitz released a model for predicting House races based on the ""fundamentals"" of the race, including the popularity of the two parties and the number of seats at stake. He found that Democrats only have a 15 percent chance of taking back the House. Similarly, the New York Times’s Nate Cohn argues that there just don’t seem to be enough gettable seats for Democrats. He notes that Democrats’ ability to win back the House in 2006 was made possible by the fact that 21 Republican seats were held in Democratic-leaning districts during that election. There are just nine such seats this year. ""If Democrats are going to retake the House anytime soon, November would probably be their best shot,"" Cohn said in a story last week, ""and as of now it’s not happening."" There’s an elephant-size question hanging over all the analyses of whether a Trump implosion could give Democrats the House: What happens to ""ticket splitting?"" Ticket splitting refers to the voters who back different parties for Congress and the presidency in the same trip to the polls. In 2012, only a record-low 8 percent of voters did so. If that number goes up in 2016 amid a Clinton landslide, it could give congressional Republicans a buffer from a Trump catastrophe. (Current polling suggests Republican congressional candidates are much more popular than Trump, but it’s unclear how many of the party’s typical voters will actually show up on Election Day.) This is why the X-factor of Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson makes these kinds of projections much more difficult. Clinton’s lead over Trump in most polls puts her about 6 points ahead, but that’s in part because of how weak Trump is — she’s normally polling around the 47 or 48 percent mark, and he’s closer to 41 or 42 percent. If Johnson gets in the neighborhood of 5 percent of the national vote, do his supporters vote for congressional Democrats? Or will they vote Republican down ballot — and make Clinton's big national lead less crucial? This is why Skelley thinks Clinton herself probably needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to pull Democrats over the finish line. If, for instance, she’s just beating Trump by 48 to 42, then congressional Democrats might need Johnson voters to go blue down ballot, which seems unlikely. ""If she’s only winning barely over 50 percent of the vote, I think it’s difficult to say with confidence that she’ll pull a lot of Democrats with her,"" Skelley said. ""I think she needs to really win the popular vote by more than that."" It’s a colossal understatement to say that the stakes are pretty darn high when it comes to control of the House. If Democrats also go on to win the Senate, winning the House would open the doors for a raft of legislative priorities over climate change, immigration, and a range of other long-held blue sky policy goals for the party. So far, most chatter around a Clinton presidency involves big plans like infrastructure reform and new Supreme Court appointments. Sweeping Congress and the presidency would transform those ambitions into a wholly different kind. But there’s another, and perhaps equally important, reason this fight is so crucial: It may be Democrats’ last shot at the House for a very, very long time. New York magazine’s Ed Kilgore explains: If Democrats do fall short of what they need to regain control of the House even as Hillary Clinton becomes president, prospects for further gains in the near term will probably not be good. The party controlling the White House almost always loses House seats in midterms (1998 and 2002 were the rare exceptions), and 2018 would be a third-term midterm for Democrats, making the odds of an anti–White House trend even stronger. Beyond that, Democrats have a well-known midterm turnout problem associated with their heavy reliance on parts of the electorate — notably young people and minorities — that rarely turn out proportionately in nonpresidential elections. As for 2020, it’s worth noting that Democrats gained only eight House seats when President Obama was reelected in 2012. Many Democrats have certainly come to despise Trump over the course of a bitter and long campaign. But if he can blunder his way into giving them control of the House of Representatives far earlier than anyone thought possible, maybe they can come to forgive him.",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/8/12847958/house-democrats-clinton,,Vox
16,16,11-01-17 23:10,2017,1,11,Libby Nelson,The government official in charge of ethics just harshly condemned Trump’s plan,"The nonpartisan director of the federal Office of Government Ethics ripped into President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for his businesses in an unusually public and blisteringly critical speech Wednesday afternoon. Walter Shaub went so far as to say that Trump’s conflicts of interest put democracy at risk, break with decades of tradition, and call into doubt whether Trump’s own patriotism stands up to history. Trump’s plan to step back from his businesses day to day is “meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective,” Shaub said in his remarks at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “Every president in modern times has taken the strong medicine of divestiture,” Shaub said. Trump’s plan “does not comport with the traditions of the presidency over the past 40 years.” The president-elect announced Wednesday morning that he would hand management of the Trump Organization over to his adult sons and the company’s chief financial officer. He promised to insulate himself from his businesses by donating the profits from foreign stays at his hotel to the federal government and limiting the information he received about his profits and losses. Shaub called the structure “perplexing.” Trump will still know where his business interests lie. He made clear that he plans to return to his company after his presidency. Ethics experts have long contended that the only real solution is a blind trust: Trump should sell his properties and allow someone else to invest the proceeds from the sale so that he doesn’t know what he owns. Trump’s lawyer said a blind trust would, essentially, be too difficult and expensive, since it would require Trump to sell large amounts of real estate. “The president is now entering a world of public service,” Shaub said. “He’s going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He’s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So no, I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be president of the United States of America.” The Office of Government Ethics has hammered out hundreds, if not thousands, of divestiture agreements involving federal officials. They have had to “divest assets, break open trusts, and dissolve businesses,” Shaub said, and taking those steps can be expensive and painful. But, Shaub said, “their basic patriotism usually prevails as they agree to set aside their personal interests to serve their country’s interests.” When officials were reluctant to take the required steps, the ethics office’s demands were backed up by “the unwavering example of presidents who resolved their own conflicts of interest.” Presidents in the past didn’t just set an example for the rest of their administration, Shaub said. They helped the American system of government set an example for the world on avoiding corruption. The Office of Government Ethics is charged with ensuring there are no conflicts of interest. Its employees search through thousands of pages of financial disclosures and reach agreements with would-be Cabinet nominees, as well as lower-level officials, stating the steps they’ll take to make sure their private investments and public duties don’t conflict. It’s a relatively obscure, generally apolitical agency, and Shaub — who was a career public servant in the office before being appointed by President Obama in 2013 to his first five-year term as director — is far from a public figure. His decision to make a public speech criticizing the incoming president-elect was highly unusual. But emails between the Trump transition team and the ethics office showed that Trump has had little regard for the office’s work since he came into office. For 10 days after the election, offers of assistance and guidance on ensuring an ethical transition were rebuffed. Nor did Trump’s lawyers run their plans past Shaub. If they had, he said, he would have told them it was very possible for the president to sell his real estate assets, and that other officials in the past have done so. As for Trump’s other justification — that the president “can’t have a conflict of interest” — that’s nonsense, Shaub said. “A conflict of interest is anything that creates an incentive to put your own interest before the interests of the people you serve,” Shaub said, quoting a Supreme Court decision from 1961 that called conflicts of interest “an evil which endangers the very fabric of democratic society.” If anything, Shaub said, it’s more important for presidents to avoid conflicts of interest: “The potential for corruption only grows with the increase in power.”",https://www.vox.com/2017/1/11/14243146/trump-conflicts-office-government-ethics-speech,,Vox
17,17,26-01-19 17:30,2019,1,26,Kurt Wagner,Mark Zuckerberg’s WSJ op-ed was a message to would-be regulators: Hands off our ad business,"The threat of government regulation has been looming over Facebook like a dark storm cloud for more than a year now, and it feels like it may finally be starting to rain. Last week, we learned that the FTC is considering slapping Facebook with a reported “record-setting” fine for abusing its users’ data and privacy. This week, two more things happened that make it seem like that cloud will be staying around for a while. The first was an op-ed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was published late on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal. Titled “The Facts About Facebook,” the op-ed laid out why Facebook sells ads (“to offer services for free”); why Facebook uses peoples’ personal data to target them with those ads (people “prefer more relevant ads”); and added a friendly reminder that “we don’t sell people’s data.” Zuckerberg also pointed out that Facebook’s free service is great for users because it helps them “stay connected to those they care about and to express themselves,” and it’s also great for small businesses. “Most couldn’t afford to buy TV ads or billboards, but now they have access to tools that only big companies could use before,” he wrote. In other words, Facebook provides an invaluable service to the world, and its advertising business is necessary to keep that going. If you’ve followed Facebook or Zuckerberg at all over the past few years, you’ve probably already heard most of this stuff. So why is Zuckerberg announcing it in a fancy WSJ opinion piece? There are a lot of people who want to regulate Facebook. And regulators, both in the United States and in Europe, probably read the Journal. That likely includes politicians who want to pass laws that would limit Facebook’s ad business, or regulators like those who work at the FTC. Zuckerberg is bringing his argument for why Facebook doesn’t need to be babysat — “we give people complete control” — to a news outlet that should reach the people who might disagree. But while Zuckerberg’s focus in his WSJ piece is on Facebook’s data and advertising business, the New York Times reminded everyone that this isn’t the only kind of regulation Facebook should be concerned about. In a story published Friday, the Times reported that Facebook is planning to combine the technology for all three of its standalone messaging apps: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That would enable an Instagram user, for example, to send and receive messages to people using WhatsApp, something that isn’t currently possible. Setting aside the technical challenges of connecting different apps with different features — WhatsApp only requires your phone number, for example, while Instagram allows you to have an anonymous account — the move would create one giant Facebook messaging ecosystem. Each of those services has more than a billion users. There are a lot of people who already think Facebook is a monopoly. This move won’t change their opinion. “This is why there should have been far more scrutiny during Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp which now clearly seem like horizontal mergers that should have triggered antitrust scrutiny,” tweeted Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman from California. “Imagine how different the world would be if Facebook had to compete with Instagram and WhatsApp. That would have encouraged real competition that would have promoted privacy and benefited consumers.” Could the FTC try and break up Facebook? It certainly feels possible. But as The Verge’s Casey Newton pointed out Friday in his daily newsletter, Facebook may beat them to the punch. “If the Federal Trade Commission ever planned to compel Facebook to spin out WhatsApp and Instagram — a big if, I know — you can imagine the company explaining that there was no longer such a thing as ‘WhatsApp’ or ‘Instagram,’” Newton wrote. Maybe something for Zuckerberg to explain in his next op-ed.

Now, in a partnership with security firm Palo Alto Networks, they'll be able to earn badges in cybersecurity, too. Scouts in kindergarten and first grade, known as Daisies, will be taught the basics of data privacy and online safety, while older Scouts up to grade 12 will be introduced to coding, firewalls, and how to become a ""white hat hacker"" (coder-slang for a hacker who uses her skills for good, not evil).   ""At Girl Scouts of the USA, we recognize that in our increasingly tech-driven world, future generations must possess the skills to navigate the complexities and inherent challenges of the cyber realm,"" Girl Scouts CEO Sylvia Acevedo said in a press release.   With this partnership, Girl Scouts hopes to introduce girls to computer and internet literacy and provide access to a demographic that is often left out of the burgeoning field. According to a recent study, women are grossly underrepresented in the global cybersecurity industry, making up only 11 percent of the workforce. Furthermore, the Computing Technology Industry association reports that 69 percent of women who have not pursued careers in information technology attribute their choice to not knowing what opportunities are available to them.  ""It is our hope that our collaboration will serve to cultivate our troops' budding interest in cyber security by providing access to invaluable knowledge that may otherwise not be available to girls,"" said Acevedo.   While there have been past cyber-related programs at the local level (like the Game Design badge available to LA-based Scouts), the organization's new commitment to cyber security education means that all 1.8 million Girl Scouts across the country will have access to learning these skills and, of course, earning the badges to prove it.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xpjmx/girl-scouts-are-training-the-next-generation-of-female-hackers,Identity,Vice
19,19,30-01-19 00:00,2019,1,30,Christopher Lee Inoa,An Animated Masterpiece by the Unsung Co-Founder of Studio Ghibli,"Before 2016, Isao Takahata’s Only Yesterday was considered the “lost” Ghibli film. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads One day, Hayao Miyazaki will die, and with him so will the renowned animation studio he co-founded, Studio Ghibli. When that day eventually arrives, countless images will play out in the minds of animation fans worldwide. Totoro, up in the sky, his mouth wide open, soaring while carrying a tiny umbrella; Ran, riding a giant snow-white wolf into battle, protecting the only life she’s ever known; little Chihiro trying so diligently to clean a “stink spirit” inside the strangest and most fascinating bathhouse imaginable. I’ll be thinking of those too. I’ll also be thinking of a moment that I feel like I’m watching for the first time every time I see it. A little girl and boy stand on the edge of a street, alone together. Their cheeks, once pale and white, now resemble the inside of a grapefruit. The boy, nervous yet determined, asks whether she prefers her days sunny or cloudy. Her answer excites the boy. They trade smiles and then he runs off. Overjoyed, he tosses a baseball in the air. The girl runs in the opposite direction; with nothing to throw, she climbs an invisible set of stairs and then launches herself skyward. The scene is in Isao Takahata’s 1991 masterpiece Only Yesterday, which screened at the French Institute Alliance Française’s Animation First film festival on January 26th, handpicked by this year’s guest of honor, Kirikou and The Sorceress director Michel Ocelot. Ocelot selected the film in part because it is one of his favorite films by Takahata, but the screening also honors the life and career of Takahata, who passed away in April 2018. Only Yesterday follows Takeo, a single woman in her late 20s, living and working in Tokyo, where she has spent her entire life. Taking a vacation from her office job and Tokyo itself, she heads to northern Japan to assist her brother-in-law in harvesting safflowers. On her journey to the countryside, she thinks back to her childhood, specifically when she was 10 years old. She thinks of her friends, her family, and her struggles with both, along with the most evil of all school subjects: math. Carrying around her fifth-grade self, Takeo ponders about her current situation, and she wonders if she let that down that spunky and ambitious 10-year-old girl. Takahata shifts between the two timelines, each one with its own unique look. In the present, the animation is sharper, more detailed, more … present. When the story shifts to the past, the animation is simpler, washed out, the edges of the frame seemingly fading away. These segments are made to resemble memories, dissolving moments in time. When the film released in 1991, it was an outlier, because it told what is still an unconventional story when it comes to feature-length animation. Only Yesterday is about an adult woman making adult decisions, something much bigger and scarier than any energy ball thrown at Goku. The festival featured the English dub, produced by GKIDS and released in 2016, with Daisy Ridley as Takeo and Dev Patel as Toshino, an organic farmer who develops feelings for Takeo. Their performances are filled with warmth and charm, successfully selling the chemistry the two develop upon their first meeting. Before GKIDS obtained the US distribution rights to the Ghibli library from Disney, it was difficult to see Only Yesterday at home through legitimate means, let alone on the big screen. Before 2016, this film was considered the “lost” Ghibli film. Today, and hopefully for a long time to come, it will be seen for what it actually is, a masterpiece crafted by a master of the form.",https://hyperallergic.com/482109/an-animated-masterpiece-by-the-unsung-co-founder-of-studio-ghibli/,,Hyperallergic

21,21,19-11-18 13:51,2018,11,19,Umair Irfan,"Paradise, California, wildfire: why the fire threat to California is only growing","PARADISE, CALIFORNIA — Brook Jenkins moved to the town of Paradise to escape a rough neighborhood in nearby Chico and raise her three children in an idyllic small town, filled with trees. Paradise isn’t next to a forest; it’s in a forest. Trees run between houses like gargantuan picket fences. “It was peaceful up there,” Jenkins said. “It was beautiful.” Yet those elegant towering Gray pines, cottonwoods, and walnut trees that drew people to Paradise also posed an immense risk of catching on fire. Six years of drought, including the driest period in California history, collided with bark beetle infestations that started spreading in rapidly in 2010, killing off scores of the state’s iconic giants. There are now more than 129 million dead trees in California sprinkled through forests like the one in Paradise, ready to burn like matchsticks. And with more people living closer to this dry timber, the likelihood that someone, or something, will spark a fire has grown steadily higher. Residents lived uneasily for years knowing that a massive conflagration was possible. Some even recalled seeing flames inch perilously close to the town in years past. “We prepared for it, but we never thought it was going to happen,” Jenkins said. When the Camp Fire, named after Camp Creek Road where the blaze began, tore through the town on November 8, it filled the quiet streets with cacophony. The flames roared, tree trunks burst, and propane tanks exploded as the fire swiftly gained ground. By the time the fire passed, almost all of Paradise, once home to 26,000 people, was obliterated. Around Butte County, upward of 52,000 people have been forced to evacuate due to the Camp Fire. The vast blaze has already made its mark as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, having killed at least 77 people, left 993 missing, and burned through 10,360 residences and 150,000 acres. People in nearby towns saw the fire risks too, and grew concerned that they were getting worse as seasons got warmer and drier in recent years. “You have an instinct that something is not right,” said Theresa Squires, who fled with her dog Carob from Magalia, a town of 11,000 people in the path of the fire. “It doesn’t feel normal and hasn’t for a long time.” She recalled being unnerved when she first visited Magalia in 2011 and saw so many dry pine trees so close to homes. “I was just saying the day before [the Camp Fire] that this is a scary situation to be in, and lo and behold,” Squires said. It’s tempting to treat the Camp Fire as an anomaly, a one-off, worst-case scenario disaster. As Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Twitter after visiting the area this week, “Every time I come to California I say this is the worst fire I’ve seen. Once again this is the absolute worst. Worse than any war zone I saw in Iraq.” The fact is, climate and forest science tells us that massive wildfires like this are likely to become more destructive as average temperatures rise and populations grow, putting people and fuel into closer contact. We can do many things to reduce these risks. However, the Camp Fire is a stark vision of a future where we do nothing. I drove to Paradise on Thursday, venturing into ever thicker and more ominous smoke that shrouded the highway. When I arrived, I was struck that there was scarcely any sound at all, not even from leaves rustling. Bits of ash flurries drifted from charred tree branches. Dust coated every surface. Pockets in the ground were still smoldering and billowing smoke. The carcasses of cars, paint scorched off and tires melted, were scattered along the streets. The homes in Paradise are now almost all flattened save for their brick chimneys stubbornly standing firm. Only a handful of people were on my street, mainly searchers in white Tyvek suits, prodding among the wreckage aided by cadaver dogs. They are combing house by burned-out house for human remains. The swift winds that at one point advanced the flames at a rate of one football field per second have now died down. Firefighters have taken advantage of the lull to cut firebreaks in dry forests and pile up soil to control the blaze. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reports that the Camp Fire is 45 percent contained and expects to reach 100 percent by the end of the month. But even a week after the fire passed, the panicked early moments when the flames roared in remain vivid for Paradise residents like Jenkins. On the morning of November 8, Jenkins watched as the sky turned orange, and embers and ash fluttered around her house in Paradise. She rushed to get back to the elementary school where she had just dropped off two of her children. By the time she returned home, the Camp Fire had spread around her house. “Within 30 minutes altogether, it was surrounding us,” Jenkins said. “We didn’t have time to get anything.” She and her husband piled their three children, their relatives who lived with them, and all their dogs and cats into three cars and started heading away from the flames and toward Chico, about 20 miles away. The journey took more than three hours, the narrow highways choked with people like her fleeing the roaring fire. Trees ignited and fell along the roads. Traffic stopped. Jenkins was separated from her children, who were riding in a different car with relatives further behind. With cars at a standstill and the fire encroaching, Jenkins left her car to gather her stranded children on foot. When she returned to her car, she saw flames inching toward her back bumper. She said she’s grateful to be alive and wants all her friends and family to know she, her husband, her brother, her sister, and her mother-in-law, and her three children are safe. For now, she is now staying with her family in a motel in Red Bluff, about 40 miles northwest of Chico. But the home and the life she built in Paradise is gone. What’s next is uncertain. “I just don’t know where we’re going to go, what we’re going to do,” she said. Some of the people fleeing the flames found shelter with friends and family. Others are staying in evacuation centers in the nearby city of Chico. And others still are sleeping in their cars or camping in tent cities that have organically emerged in the miasma of the inferno. Down in Chico, the city of roses, the air smells dry, dusty, and oddly sweet. The smoke has bathed the city in a sunset glow even in the middle of the afternoon. Local children ride Razor scooters wearing N95 respirators. A makeshift bazaar has taken root on the edge of a Chico Walmart parking lot where volunteers distribute food, clothing, respirators, and toiletries to what’s become a de facto refugee camp. Dozens of people have camped out in their cars while others have pitched tents on the grass shoulder. The site emerged organically, but that’s also led to some frustration, according to Guido Barbero, a Chico resident who is coordinating volunteers at the site. Various city officials and local law enforcement have promised more formal leadership and another site to shelter evacuees. However, in the week since the Camp Fire ignited, the Walmart camp has only grown. Now they have word that they must clear out the site by Tuesday. Where the evacuees will go remains uncertain. “It’s really the lack of information” that’s hampering relief, Barbero said. At the same time, the ingredients for an unprecedented fire have been brewing for years, so better planning and coordination for a relief effort should have been in place to deal with the fallout. “This was going to happen sooner or later,” Barbero said. “This was not a surprise to us.” While the campsite has been overwhelmed by donations of clothes, food, and supplies, some of the evacuees are growing concerned about health issues. Over the din of portable generators, coughing echoes throughout the camp as the omnipresent wildfire smoke in the air exacerbates health issues like asthma. The air quality here is some of the worst in the world, earning a rating of “hazardous.” Other residents complained about theft and poor sanitation. Temperatures are also dropping as the city heads further into winter. The strip of dried grass where people have pitched their tents is prone to flooding, and rain is expected next week. Some health issues are also emerging in some of the formal evacuation sites. One shelter in Chico reported a norovirus outbreak. Meanwhile, across town at Bidwell Junior High School, Red Cross volunteers are moving cots into a gymnasium to give the 65 evacuees there more space. Katherine Grochowski, the shelter supervisor, said the site also has too many donations of food and clothing. “Cash is the best thing to give,” she said. Grochowski, who has been working in relief efforts for 19 years, said the recent spate of fires and storms across the United States “seems like one disaster after another” but added that relief organizations are getting plenty of firsthand experience, helping them get better at responding to calamities. But on the question of whether people afflicted by a disaster should relocate or rebuild, Grochowski choked up and recalled her own brush with disaster, a tornado that struck her hometown of Owensboro, Kentucky. Some people moved away, but others were adamant about restoring what they lost in the storm, an attitude she found inspiring. People all over the world have a sense of place and belonging with their homes, no matter the risks, according to Grochowski. And she couldn’t imagine moving away herself after a disaster. Chico city manager Mark Orme agreed. “The optimal solution here is to get people back home as soon as possible,” he said. Even though the climate is changing — warming up the air, drying out the trees, and increasing the severity of droughts, thereby fueling massive fires— Orme believes that it is possible to prepare for these risks. That can range from fireproof construction to strategically removing fire-prone trees. But he acknowledged that it’s hard to prepare for an unprecedented disaster like the Camp Fire, and rebuilding to mitigate the next wildfire will take towns like Paradise, Magalia, and Concow into uncharted territory with untested solutions. “You obviously never expect the largest of disasters in State of California history to happen on your doorstep,” he said. Right now, the City of Chico is trying to restore a sense of normalcy for evacuees. Chico officials even hosted a town council meeting for Paradise officials, allowing them to use the chambers to discuss the minutiae of running a city, with the added challenge that most of the city is gone. “I was amazed at the pride and passion of that community,” Orme said.",https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/16/18096245/paradise-california-wildfire,,Vox
22,22,28-12-18 00:00,2018,12,28,Imani Moise,Wells Fargo to pay $575 million in settlement with U.S. states,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) will pay $575 million to settle claims made by U.S. states, the latest settlement as the bank works to resolve lingering investigations and legal battles stemming from its sales-practices scandal and to remove a punitive asset cap.    Two years ago, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle federal government claims that the bank created phony customer accounts. Since then, the bank has racked up over $2 billion in penalties as other issues were discovered across most of its business lines.   Friday’s settlement resolves claims by all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the accounts, as well as claims that the bank improperly referred and charged customers for a number of financial products like auto and life insurance.     “Instead of safeguarding its customers Wells Fargo exploited them,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “This is an incredible breach of trust that threatens not only the customer who depended on Wells Fargo, but confidence in our banking system.”   The settlement, confirmed by Wells Fargo and the offices of various state attorneys general, was first reported earlier by Reuters.  Wells Fargo has been seeking a fresh start after revelations that its employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts tangled the nation’s fourth-largest bank in fierce investor and regulatory scrutiny for the past two years.  Over the summer, Wells Fargo launched a marketing campaign saying the bank had been “re-established” this year, but Wells Fargo continued to attract fresh headlines about the customer abuses of the past.  The bank has been working to resolve ongoing investigations and legal battles as it tries to gain approval from the Federal Reserve to lift its cap on assets.   This year, the bank has settled claims with the New York attorney general, a class of investors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, but the bank still has a number of probes looming over its bottom line. Wells Fargo still faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor, according to its most recent securities filing.

24,24,21-05-19 00:00,2019,5,21,,Factbox: Investments by automakers in the U.S. and China since Trump came to power,"(Reuters) - Major automakers have announced a slew of investments in the United States since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 and exerted pressure on the industry to create more U.S. jobs.  China is also attracting much investment, with companies keen to increase their share of the world’s largest car market and keep up with the country’s push toward electric vehicles.  Following are summaries of investments and restructuring efforts made by major automakers in the United States and China since 2017. Some did not respond to requests for information or only provided details for one country.  Toyota Motor Corp has pledged to invest almost $13 billion in the United States between 2017 and 2021 to boost manufacturing capacity and jobs. This includes $1.6 billion for a vehicle assembly plant in Alabama jointly run with Mazda Motor Corp and $238 million in manufacturing capacity in Kentucky to assemble 112,000 gasoline-electric hybrid models a year. Toyota’s Kentucky plant has also gained $1.3 billion in investment to boost its competitiveness.  FCA in January 2017 said it would invest $1 billion in truck and SUV manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Ohio, creating 2,000 U.S. jobs. It described the plan as a move to solidify the United States as its global manufacturing hub for Jeep products. In February this year, it announced additional investment of $4.5 billion in production facilities in Michigan, to produce more SUVs and trucks and create nearly 6,500 jobs.   General Motors Co in November 2018 announced a sweeping restructuring program that aims to cut production of slow-selling models and slash its North American workforce so resources can be shifted to electric and autonomous vehicles. GM put four U.S. factories and one Canadian plant on notice for potential closure. It noted in late April that it has invested $4.3 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2017.    Ford Motor Co in 2017 said it would invest $2.95 billion in manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Michigan. Those plans included $900 million for its Kentucky truck plant to secure 1,000 hourly jobs and produce the redesigned Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. This year, Ford said it will invest an additional $1.2 billion in manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Illinois to expand production capacity and add new jobs.  In 2017, Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and parts suppliers, said it planned to lift U.S. investment by 50% over five years to $3.1 billion. An executive said at that time the group was considering a new U.S. factory to build high-margin, high-demand models such as a U.S.-specific sport utility vehicle and a Genesis premium vehicle.  In January this year, Volkswagen AG said it planned to invest $800 million to build what it called a new generation of electric vehicles at its Chattanooga plant in Tennessee. The first electric car from the plant is slated to roll off the production line in 2022.  Honda Motor Co said in 2017 it would invest a combined $352 million in manufacturing facilities located in Alabama and Ohio that would support production of the redesigned Accord car and create jobs. It also said it would spend $124 million on an advanced wind tunnel facility in Ohio.  Although not formally announced, the Japanese automaker has confirmed information from sources that is investing in capacity in Tianjin and Guangzhou to produce 240,000 more vehicles annually. The size of the investment is not known.  The company’s China unit did not respond to a Reuters request for information.  No major additional investment in China manufacturing capacity since the Detroit automaker announced it had earmarked $12 billion to expand production between 2014 and 2017.  Ford said in 2017 it would invest in its joint-venture manufacturing facilities in China to support production of five vehicles, including a Lincoln premium SUV and the company’s first global all-electric small SUV. The investment amount was not disclosed.  In 2018, Ford said it would invest in joint-venture manufacturing facilities in Chongqing to produce vehicles including the redesigned Escort and Focus models. It also said it would be investing to assemble the redesigned Explorer SUV but did not disclose where it will be made.  This year the U.S. automaker announced plans to produce three Lincoln models in China by 2021, instead of bringing in those models from North America.  Hit by a downturn in sales, Hyundai said in April it was suspending production at one of its five plants in China. Kia is also looking at suspending production at a China plant, a source familiar with the matter has said.  Volkswagen Group in 2018 opened three factories – in Qingdao, Foshan and Tianjin – to produce more SUVs and electric cars as well as other vehicles. The German group, which produces and sells vehicles in China through its Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda brands, also broke ground for its electric-car factory in Shanghai, which will start e-car production in 2020.  Through 2022, Volkswagen Group and its joint-venture partners will invest around 15 billion euros in e-mobility, autonomous driving and other areas. This includes R&D spending on new technologies. In June 2017, it announced a 50-50 joint venture with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, its third partnership with a Chinese automaker, to design, produce and market electric cars.  Honda’s joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group in December 2016 announced it would build a 3 billion yuan ($435 million) assembly plant in Wuhan capable of producing 120,000 vehicles a year. The plant opened in April this year.

25,25,21-07-16 00:00,2016,7,21,Rachel Browne, Teen prisoners rioted and lit British Columbia's ‘super jail’ on fire this week,"A six-hour riot that started with a fire and devolved into a rampage through a youth ""super jail"" in British Columbia this week has confirmed long-held fears over what would happen when the province closed down other prisons and consolidated the inmates — some from rival gangs — into one place. It was Tuesday evening when a group of teen boys gathered together inside the youth jail in Burnaby and lit a fire by heating up a piece of paper in the toaster. The mayhem escalated quickly from there, with the kids, who used masks to hide their identities from the security cameras, smashing windows and furniture, fashioning weapons out of table legs, and barricading doors. They destroyed the microwaves and dishwasher, and broke the sprinklers. After they ruined one room and started a flood, they rammed their way into another and continued their rampage. By 2:30 am, officers with the federal police force and 19 firefighters had arrived and the situation was contained. Somehow no one was seriously injured, although there was immense damage to the facility. An outbreak of violence of this kind in prisons is rare in Canada, and even less so in youth jails. But correctional workers and youth advocates have, for years, warned that something like this would happen in Burnaby as the BC provincial government closed down the youth jail in the capital of Victoria and started pooling inmates from all over the province to save money. Inevitably, rival gang members came under one roof. This new ""super-jail"" has become a hotbed for violence and acts of aggression. A six-hour riot that started with a fire and devolved into a rampage through a youth ""super jail"" in British Columbia this week has confirmed long-held fears over what would happen when the province closed down other prisons and consolidated the inmates — some from rival gangs — into one place.

Inevitably, rival gang members came under one roof. This new ""super-jail"" has become a hotbed for violence and acts of aggression. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, BC's representative for children and youth, told VICE News she has been calling on the province to immediately reopen other youth jails to ease tensions at the Burnaby Youth Custody Center. It's believed that the group of young men involved in the riots were associated with the rival gangs from Surrey and Prince George, but further details haven't been made public. Turpel-Lafond says the incident has all the hallmarks of gang-related violence. ""My eye will be strongly fixed on what's going on with the young people and whether this is a pattern, and what's going to be done to prevent this from happening again,"" she said. The Burnaby jail was already grappling with rampant violence. Over the last five years, assaults among the young inmates has doubled, even though fewer people were being held there. Last November, a teen in the jail launched a lawsuit against the province alleging that he was kept in solitary confinement, and accuses the guards of negligence and false imprisonment. Burnaby Youth Custody Services Centre (Photo via Government of BC) Turpel-Lafond added that, before the other jails were shuttered, it was possible to send young offenders to facilities where they would least likely experience violence. This is of great concern when many of the inmates are affiliated with one of the province's gangs. ""If we knew a young person or their parent ran a street-level gang here, or if they were going to be a target by virtue of who they were, care was taken to decide on where they should be located. Now, we don't have those options,"" she said. Dean Purdy, the head of correctional and sheriff services for the BC Government Employees Union, said in an interview that there has also been a spike in violence against the guards who work there. Right before the riot broke out, he says the staff there could sense something was about to happen, so they hid in the secure office. Riot at Burnaby youth detention centre causes extensive damage — CBC British Columbia (@cbcnewsbc)July 21, 2016 ""There have been several assaults on correctional officers over the last few months, and all the anecdotal info from our staff is that tensions are very high inside. It's getting very difficult to manage the inmates,"" Purdy said. ""And there's very little repercussions when inmates exhibit poor behavior."" Staff Sergeant Lindsey Houghton, with the provincial anti-gang unit, told The Province on Wednesday that the force has been looking into gang activity in youth jails for many years. ""This is nothing new and people should not be surprised at it,"" said Houghton, who added that the notorious Red Scorpions gang — responsible for one of the province's worst gang-related murders in 2007 — was founded in the Burnaby jail. However, the head of programs for the Burnaby youth jail put out a statement on Thursday that said the closure of the Victoria jail was not to blame for the riot and that the impetus for the incident was ""a room search earlier in the day, which resulted in a loss of privileges."" Purdy added that the inmates responsible for the violence have been separated from the general prison population, and an internal investigation is pending. Earlier this year, BC's premier announced $23 million in new funding to fight the gang wars in Surrey, which is plagued with frequent shootings and kids as young as 12 joining the drug trade.

27,27,05-02-19 00:00,2019,2,5,"Andrew MacAskill, Simon Jessop",Exclusive: Britain's financial heartland unbowed as Brexit risks deepen,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial services industry has emerged largely unscathed so far from the build-up to Brexit, with about 2,000 roles expected to have moved or been created overseas even as the risk of a disorderly exit grows, a new Reuters survey showed.  Many bankers and politicians predicted Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum would prompt a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London’s position in global finance.  But the number of jobs UK-based financial institutions say they actually expect to shift overseas has fallen steeply from the 5,766 predicted to move in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the last survey in September. This new estimate is about a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in the first survey in September 2017.   A no-deal Brexit would mean Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on trade. Currently, the UK is on track for such a scenario because a deal giving London and Brussels a 21-month transition period to negotiate a trading relationship is at risk of collapse.   Most bankers, however, are confident a compromise will be hammered out. They are waiting to see what will be agreed and what the relationship will be, before making any final decisions about relocations.  The survey results are based on answers from 132 of the biggest or most internationally-focused banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges to a survey conducted between Jan. 3 and Jan. 28. The jobs are equivalent to 0.5 percent of the 400,000 people who work in financial services in London.  Meanwhile, top investment banks plan to hire far more people in London than anywhere else in Europe, indicating they expect Britain will remain their main regional hub, at least in the short term, a separate Reuters survey showed.  “It will be a slow burn. We won’t know what the full impact will look like for at least 10 years,” said Catherine McGuinness, the de facto political leader of the municipal body that helps to run London’s financial district, known as the City.   “But the City is always changing and it will find a way to thrive.”  Bankers’ sanguine outlook comes even as the United Kingdom is on course to leave the EU in 52 days without a divorce deal, a step that could send shockwaves through financial markets.  British lawmakers last week instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal, a move that is fiercely opposed by other members of the bloc, meaning there is likely to be weeks of political brinkmanship.  The survey findings suggest London, which has the largest number of banks and the largest commercial insurance market in the European Union, is likely to remain the region’s center of international finance.   The decision to leave the EU has jolted London’s finance industry, which has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the world for centuries.   Banks and insurers in Britain currently enjoy largely unfettered access to customers across the bloc in most financial activities. Elements long taken for granted, such as the right to buy and sell products in a single market, are suddenly in flux.   Under a worst-case no-deal scenario, consultants Oliver Wyman predicted as many as 75,000 jobs could go, while the London Stock Exchange suggested two years ago that figure could be as high as 232,000.  The future of London as Europe’s financial center is one of the most important outcomes in the Brexit talks because it is Britain’s largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax revenue.   Large investment banks are expected to have moved about 890 jobs, just under half the number expected by end-March, according to interviews with more than two dozen industry sources.  Bank of America is moving about 200 employees to Paris by the end of February, according to sources. The bank declined to comment.    But many other finance companies are holding off staff moves until the political situation becomes clearer.         HSBC, which has publicly said up to 1,000 jobs could move to Paris, has so far not moved any staff, according to a source at the bank. Royal Bank of Scotland, which said it could move 150 employees to Amsterdam, also has not moved any employees, a source at the bank said.  Under the terms of the current divorce deal, only a basic level of access to the bloc’s markets will be maintained after Brexit, but if Britain decides to leave the EU next month without a trade deal this would mean no transition period to lessen the turmoil.  A senior executive at one U.S. investment bank said they would have to potentially double or triple the number of staff moved overseas if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal.   So far, the executive added, the impact of Brexit had been much less than expected and was less of a concern than the slowing economy in China and political upheaval in the United States.  “It’s a real pain in the arse, but it’s a technical problem, it’s solvable,” the executive said.  Ninety of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, although only 59 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact or they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment.  For the first time since Reuters started surveying City financiers on their job plans, a handful said there was a possibility Brexit might not happen at all because of the lack of agreement within British politics over how an exit can be engineered.   But the companies said they would not reverse the job moves if Britain were to remain in the EU.  “The issue of political risk has become a really significant issue,” McGuinness said. “Even if you turned Brexit back, which I can’t see happening, I think we have damaged our international image and we are going to have to work very hard to regain it.”  Additional reporting by Sinead Cruise and Jonathan Saul in London, Noor Zainab Hussain and Arathy S Nair in Bangalore and Suzanne Barlyn in New York.

28,28,18-12-16 16:40,2016,12,18,Kevin Trahan,Nebraska Is Probably Regretting Letting Go of Football Championship Subdivision-Bound Bo Pelini Right Now,"Just over two years ago, Nebraska fired head coach Bo Pelini after a 9-3 season and a season-ending win over rival Iowa, which included an impressive fourth quarter comeback. Delusional in their abilities, the Cornhuskers thought they were better than 9-3, so they fired a coach who had previously brought them to the Big Ten Championship Game and probably would again. The past two years haven't been kind to Nebraska, which has gone 14-10 under new coach Mike Riley and is coming off a 40-10 shellacking to Iowa. The Huskers went 9-3 (!!!), but they didn't beat anyone with a pulse, supposedly the knock on Pelini from the fan base (though it wasn't very true). Meanwhile, as Nebraska prepares for its second-tier bowl game, Bo Pelini—still a very good coach—is headed to the Football Championship Subdivision title game with his new yet hometown team, Youngstown State. They got there with this catch on the last play of the game: With a championship berth wrapped up, what's Pelini's message to Nebraska? We can only guess that it's something along the lines of, ""Fuck you, fans. Fuck all of you."" Yes, Pelini was rough around the edges, which is probably part of why he was fired from Nebraska, in addition to the perennial nine-win seasons. He seemingly never looked happy, and in addition to ""fuck you fans,"" said things like ""they want to fire me, go ahead."" One game, he swung his hat at an official, and afterward he said he was reacting to a ""chickenshit call."" Most coaches will apologize for behavior like that; Pelini simply said the opposing coach was acting worse than him. He even called a meeting with his former players after he was fired in which he called the athletic director ""a total pussy."" Things, uh, haven't changed at Youngstown State. Pelini is who he is, and he's never going to change. He didn't fit in at Nebraska, and that's why a move all the way down to FCS Youngstown State was probably a good thing—he got to go back to his hometown, to a place that appreciated him. He should certainly be more sensitive with his words, but there's no evidence that Pelini is a terrible person of any sort; he's just kind of a hot head. There is evidence, however, that he is a very good football coach, and there are a lot of Power Five teams that could use him right about now. Pelini's coaching acumen has been verified once again this season, and as Nebraska gets set for a mediocre bowl game, Pelini will be playing for a national title. Perhaps in public, Pelini won't say anything about the Huskers' fall and his subsequent rise, but in private, we know what he's saying, while laughing all the way to the title game: ""Fuck you, fans. Fuck all of you.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbdjvw/nebraska-is-probably-regretting-letting-go-of-football-championship-subdivision-bound-bo-pelini-right-now,Sports,Vice
29,29,24-11-18 00:00,2018,11,24,"Nandita Bose, Melissa Fares","On Black Friday, more U.S. shoppers chose the computer over the mall","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping season showed the increasing preference for online purchases, as more Americans opted to stay home and use their smartphones while sales and traffic at brick-and-mortar stores declined.  The ongoing shift to online shopping has forced retailers across the country to invest heavily in boosting their e-commerce businesses, and also highlights the impact of early holiday promotions and year-round deals on consumer spending.  The weekend also redefined the importance of Black Friday. For the past few years, Black Friday was believed to be waning in importance, but it is now turning into a day when shoppers do not necessarily flock to stores but spend heavily online.   Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, said online sales are starting to complement in-store shopping over the weekend, and for shoppers and retailers the two platforms are starting to converge.   This is happening more and more as retailers like Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc sell both online and through stores, making winning the transaction more important than where it occurs, retail consultants and analysts said.  Online sales rose more than 23 percent, crossing $6 billion on Black Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers. On Thanksgiving, it estimated sales grew 28 percent to $3.7 billion.  Preliminary data from analytics firm RetailNext showed net sales at brick-and-mortar stores fell 4 to 7 percent over the two days, while traffic fell 5 to 9 percent, continuing the trend of recent years. No data was yet available for actual spending in stores.  In 2017, brick-and-mortar sales were down 8.9 percent for the weekend year-over-year, and shopper traffic fell 4.4 percent. In 2016, store sales were down 4.2 percent and traffic was down 4.4 percent, according to RetailNext.  The decrease in store foot traffic is a little greater than it has been in years past, though still within expectations, RetailNext spokesperson Ray Hartjen said.  Data from retail research firm ShopperTrak also showed that visits to stores fell a combined 1 percent during Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared with the same days in 2017.  Brian Field, senior director of advisory services at ShopperTrak, said online sales have eroded traffic from retailers over the years, “but what we have noticed is that the decline is starting to flatten out ... Overall its been consistent with where it’s been over the last few years.”  In 2017, visits to physical stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were down 1.6 percent, according to the firm.     “This decline feels pretty good to me. I think retail is in for a good season,” Field said.  Retail consultants have said spending patterns over the weekend are not as indicative of the entire season as they were a few years ago the tendency now is to spread shopping over November and December.  The National Retail Federation forecast U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December will increase between 4.3 and 4.8 percent over 2017, for a total of $717.45 billion to $720.89 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.

Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) began an offensive in early April to take Tripoli from fighters loyal to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj’s Government of National Accord (GNA) which has the backing of the United Nations.  The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, has not been able to breach the southern defenses of Tripoli. The fighting has killed at least 510 people, forced 75,000 out of their homes and trapped thousands of migrants in detention centers.   “Of course, the political solution is still the goal. But to get back to politics, we must first finish with militias,” Haftar told the newspaper.    Haftar also said the head of U.N. mission to Libya, Ghassan Salame, was no longer impartial.  “Partition of Libya is maybe what our adversaries want. This is maybe what Ghassan Salame also wants.”  The flare-up in the conflict in Libya - which has been gripped by anarchy since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 - began in early April, when the LNA advanced on the capital.  Even though France and other Western countries officially back the Libyan government, some have supported Haftar as they see him as a bulwark against Islamist militias in the country.  Macron had asked Haftar in a meeting held in Paris this week to make a public step toward a ceasefire, without much luck, a French official told Reuters.

31,31,22-06-17 15:20,2017,6,22,Jeff Guo,Republicans totally outsmarted the mainstream media on Obamacare repeal,"The long-awaited Senate health care reform bill drops Thursday, and it will be a front-page story in every newspaper in America. Over the next week, this document will be parsed to death by pundits on both sides. It will trigger countless editorials and, quite possibly, foment public protests. There’s no exaggerating it: This is the biggest legislative event of 2017 so far, inaugurating the final stretch of debate over a law poised to achieve one of the GOP’s dearest priorities: repealing and replacing Obamacare. But even though the effort has been going on for weeks, the bill release Thursday will be the first time much of the media has treated it like an urgent news event. For the past few weeks, Senate Republicans have been drafting the bill in secret. Knowing that they only need their own side’s votes to pass the bill, they have shut out both the Democrats and the American people from the lawmaking process. Now, there will be only be a brief period for bipartisan discussion before a vote next week. Compared to the drawn-out discussion over Obamacare in 2009, this effort to repeal it is as rushed and furtive as it gets. It’s the legislative equivalent of throwing sunglasses on a Hollywood starlet and dashing her past the paparazzi line. And while the debate over Obamacare was a prominent news story for weeks, the process of drafting the bill that Senate Republicans call the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 has successfully flown under the radar. In the past week, many critics have asked why the press has gone along with GOP’s unprecedented opaqueness. But has it really? Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan blamed editors and televisions producers for downplaying the matter. Where was the wall-to-wall coverage on CNN? Where were the bold New York Times headlines? The New Republic’s Brian Beutler argued that the lack of emphasis on health care reform in recent weeks reflects the media’s bias toward newness and action. Reporters, unfortunately, are not accustomed to writing about the absence of action. “By withholding details, [Republicans] limit the range of reportorial inquiry to questions about the process itself,” Beutler writes. “Have you seen the bill yet? No. Will you withhold support for the bill unless it runs through an open process? I am very dismayed about the process.” These are both fair critiques, but the blame doesn’t entirely lie with the media. Sullivan concedes that sites like Politico and the Hill have vigorously covered the matter, and both the Washington Post and the New York Times have written about this topic “almost daily.” Is it their fault that Americans didn’t care or pay attention? As my colleague Jeff Stein reported, even liberals have been hard pressed to gin up outrage over the Senate bill. “We literally don’t have enough information to motivate people,” one activist told him recently. It is easy to rally people around specific, upsetting provisions in a piece of legislation. It’s much more difficult to organize a protest around unprecedented norm-breaking and lack of good faith. This, in part, is the media’s job: to warn the public of problems coming down the pike — and to make sure that people pay attention. But news judgment has become devalued in the Trump era. If editors plastered their front page every day with headlines asking “Where’s the bill?” Fox News pundits would accuse them of partisanship. They’d run the risk of further losing credibility among a large swath of Americans. The danger of living in a time when people choose their own news is that it becomes difficult to mark the evaporation of democratic ideals. The power of the press comes from its ability to motivate public concern, and this may be one of the clearest examples yet of the erosion of the press as an institution. The media has said “this is not normal” a thousand times since Tuesday, but it has been no match for the GOP’s savvy strategy of legislative secrecy. The watchdog is barking, but few are listening.",https://www.vox.com/2017/6/22/15854398/republicans-outsmarted-mainstream-media-obamacare-repeal-ahca,,Vox

33,33,02-07-19 00:00,2019,7,2,"Nick Carey, Ankit Ajmera","U.S. June sales a mixed bag for automakers; SUVs, trucks still strong","(Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted mixed U.S. sales results for June and the second quarter, with demand still fairly strong for SUVs and pickup trucks while passenger car sales continued a long-running decline.  In the pickup truck segment, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s (FCA) (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) Ram outsold General Motors Co’s (GM.N) Chevrolet Silverado in the second quarter. GM reports sales on a quarterly instead of monthly basis.  The Silverado has long held second place behind Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) F-Series pickup trucks, with Ram often a distant third. But so far in 2019, FCA’s sales of Ram pickups have outpaced Chevy Silverado sales by more than 40,000 vehicles.    FCA, GM and Ford escalated a price war in June over pickup trucks - one of few vehicle market segments offering substantial profits, which matters at a time when overall U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to fall this year.  High interest rates, plus competition from millions of nearly new, off-lease vehicles have translated into fewer consumers splurging on new cars. After a weak start to the year, sales in the last couple of months have been largely flat versus 2018.   “The market is not as down as it was to start off the year, which says a lot about market stability,” said George Augustaitis, director of industry analysis at CarGurus Inc, an online marketplace for new and used cars. “At this point, a Fed interest rate cut could be the thing that sparks the industry.”  There have been growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, possibly as soon as at the central bank’s next policy meeting at the end of July, although Fed officials last week pushed back on those expectations.   FCA said its sales rose 2% in June, driven by a 56% jump in Ram sales.   “This type of year-over-year growth is likely not sustainable in the short term, however, calendar-year-to-date, our pick-up truck sales are up 28%,” FCA U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland said in a statement. “As a result I do feel that double-digit truck growth is achievable well into the future.”   GM said second-quarter sales fell 1.5%, with strong sport utility vehicle sales offset by poor performance for its pickup trucks. The No. 1 U.S. automaker said sales of trucks would pick up in the third quarter as both its most popular and most affordable versions of the Silverado will hit dealer showrooms.  Ford, which like GM reports sales quarterly, saw its sales fall 4.1% in the second quarter, with retail sales to consumers down more than 8%, according to auto industry data.  Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) reported a 3.5% drop in sales for June, led by falling sedan sales.   In the last few years, Americans have increasingly shunned passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks.  Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) sales plunged nearly 15%, with huge drops for much of its lineup including the best-selling Rogue SUV. After years of relying on steep discounts to increase U.S. market share, Nissan is trying to pull back so it can sell vehicles more profitably.  Billy Hayes, Nissan’s North American vice president for sales, said many of the automaker’s models will be revamped in the next year or two, which will help lift sales.  Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) on Tuesday reported a 1.5% rise in U.S. sales for June, lifted by strong demand for SUVs and trucks.

34,34,04-10-16 18:00,2016,10,4,Dara Lind,The most revealing Republican ad of the election is an attack ad against Tim Kaine,"The Republican Party characterizes itself as the party of the Constitution. But on the eve of the vice presidential debate, it decided to attack Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine for carrying out a constitutional duty. The Republican National Committee debuted a TV ad Monday that attacks Kaine for representing convicted criminals as a civil rights lawyer in Richmond (as well as selectively highlighting his record as governor to make him seem more generous with clemency than he actually was). As the ad’s narration puts it, Kaine “constantly protected the worst kinds of people.” Sure he did. Someone had to. The Constitution says so. Attacking Kaine for fulfilling a constitutional duty isn’t just an expression of hypocrisy, though. The ad — and its bungled rollout — are the clearest sign yet that Republicans who’ve embraced criminal justice reform, and tried to move past racially polarizing “tough on crime” politics, have lost the battle for the soul of their party. “Criminals are bad, and Democrats like criminals” is a well-established genre of Republican attack ad. So it’s no surprise that when the Kaine ad was released on Monday, Roll Call, the outlet that obtained “exclusive” right to the ad, billed it as a “Willie Horton–style” attack. But the conventional wisdom on this type of attack has changed — not least because in 2016, many people understand the racial undertones in portraying Democrats as coddling “criminals.” When the GOP tried a similar attack on Kaine during his 2005 race for Virginia governor, as pointed out by Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee (who worked on Kaine’s campaign), not only did it not work, but it also helped turn voters against his opponent. That put the RNC in an awkward position — and made the ad’s rollout (as Politico noticed) seem somewhere between “bungled” and “unintentionally comical.” The RNC and its communications director Sean Spicer both tweeted out the Roll Call article (with apparent pride). Then, as other Republicans recoiled from the suggestion that a “Willie Horton–style attack” was somehow an okay thing to do, the RNC and Spicer deleted the tweets — and Spicer started demanding that Roll Call issue a correction to change the headline he’d tweeted out himself just hours before. In fairness to the RNC, the anti-Kaine attack ad stays away from the racialized images of “scary black men” that the Horton ad (and its descendants) so freely trafficked in. Most of the criminals featured in the Kaine ad are white. But the reason that “law and order” is such a powerful trope to begin with is because of fears of lawless nonwhites — something the Republican Party’s current presidential nominee understands extremely well. It’s sad to see this. For a few years, it looked like the Republican Party — or at least one wing of it — was beginning to figure out a way to talk about the criminal justice system that avoided racial polarization. Reformers at the state level, and senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee, talked about the need for criminal justice reform as a fiscal, moral, and, yes, constitutional matter. They deserve a lot of credit for putting reform on the national agenda. They’ve helped bring some of their own party’s skeptics on board — and have helped inspire Democrats to move past their own tough-on-crime traditions. Some have even addressed the right to counsel itself: Republican megadonors Charles and David Koch fund scholarships and training for future public defenders. But it looks like Republican reformers have lost the fight within their own party. The anti-Kaine attack ad might not be as racially grotesque as the Willie Horton ad. But its message is arguably even more horrifying. Instead of attacking a particular clemency policy, it attacks the right to counsel itself. The right to counsel is a constitutional guarantee. Period. It’s right there in the Sixth Amendment (emphasis added): In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The Supreme Court hasn’t always agreed on the scope of the right to counsel: Only in the mid-20th century did it decide that defendants who couldn’t afford to hire lawyers had the right to public defenders. But the basic fact of it is pretty inviolable. There is no crime so heinous in the US court system that a lawyer is not permitted — even obligated — to speak in its defense. Tim Kaine wasn’t a public defender; he was a civil rights lawyer who often took on appeals for convicted criminals facing the death penalty. (This Newsweek profile of Kaine by Emily Cadei discusses his decision to take on cases like this.) That’s a type of “criminal prosecution.” His clients had the right to counsel. Kaine didn’t have to choose to defend them himself, but someone would end up having to defend them. Kaine decided to be the person who’d fulfill that constitutional duty. And now he’s getting attacked for it. This isn’t the first time that defending “the worst kinds of people” has become a political liability in later life. Earlier this cycle, Hillary Clinton was attacked for representing a rapist early in her own law career. Inevitably, this becomes a factor in judicial appointments themselves. Barack Obama reportedly passed over Judge Jane Kelly of the Eighth Circuit for his latest Supreme Court appointment slot because of the attacks that were already being rolled out against her for representing violent criminals as a public defender. (He went with the centrist, tough-on-crime Merrick Garland instead.) This has real consequences. The Supreme Court hasn’t had a criminal defense lawyer as a member in a quarter-century. Over that time, it’s eroded defendants’ rights — including the right to counsel. Furthermore, when it’s common to attack a politician or judge for once having represented bad people in court, young lawyers who want to be politicians or judges in later life are likely to avoid becoming criminal defenders. They just won’t want to risk it. That deprives defendants of good counsel; it means that politicians and judges don’t understand the criminal justice system from the point of view of the accused; and it makes them all the more likely to demonize lawyers, like Tim Kaine, who choose to step into the role that the Constitution demands. Republican reformers could stop this vicious cycle if they could get their party to stop treating constitutional rights as an election year wedge issue. But as long as the Republican Party, in even-numbered years, attacks people for representing violent criminals in court, it’s not going to be able to pressure its elected officials and its base to support criminal justice reforms in odd-numbered ones. The racial politics of Trumpism are potent, and it’s hard to imagine they’ll be fumigated from the Republican Party even if Trump loses. The criminal justice reform wing of the GOP will be one casualty. The Constitution — or at least the Sixth Amendment — might be another.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/4/13161274/tim-kaine-attack-ad,,Vox
35,35,31-10-18 22:30,2018,10,31,Nadra Nittle,Proud Boy John Kinsman: why defendants get makeovers for court,"When John Kinsman of the Proud Boys, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group, appeared in court for a hearing last week, he looked like an entirely different man. (The Proud Boys deny SPLC’s hate group designation and question the legitimacy of the organization.) During a previous court appearance, on October 19, Kinsman had a scraggly beard, long hair, and wore a T-shirt and overalls. Less than a week later, he was unrecognizable in court in a suit, black-rimmed glasses, short slick hair, and a clean-shaven face. Proud Boys member gets makeover for court appearance https://t.co/qSy0aBc9CN pic.twitter.com/5riGKuESns The striking makeover is likely not a coincidence, but speaks to an understanding by Kinsman’s legal team that appearance is currency in the nation’s courtrooms. The likelihood of conviction and the length of a criminal sentence has been linked to how attractive, modest, or even light-complected defendants look. Amber Baylor, associate professor of law at the Texas A&M University School of Law, discussed earlier this year how it’s both “standard” and “good practice” for defense attorneys to spruce up their clients before a court appearance. She also runs the criminal defense clinic at Texas A&M’s law school. “It’s very common to ask your client to get a haircut if they want to, because you think it might help them in their case,” Baylor told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times in March. “Tell them how they may want to sit ... what direction they want to look in, whether or not they want to trim their beard.” Looking a certain way can alter perceptions about defendants. Kinsman, for instance, belongs to the Proud Boys, an organization that Facebook recently banned; regarding the ban, a spokeswoman for the social media company said in a statement, “Our team continues to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and works with partners to better understand hate organizations as they evolve.” And last year, Jason Kessler, who previously attended Proud Boys meetings, helped to organize the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in which counter protester Heather Heyer was killed. (The Proud Boys deny any involvement with the rally and further deny that Kessler was ever a member of the group.) Kinsman was in court stemming from charges related to a fight with Antifa protesters in New York City on Oct. 12. His charges included attempted assault, riot, and criminal possession of a weapon. #JohnKinsman of the #ProudBoys was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court late last night on charges of Attempted Gang Assault in the Second Degree (a felony) & various misdemeanor charges.He is being held in jail on $25,000 bail. pic.twitter.com/kJ1nWOh0i7 But the Kinsman in court last week (he’s due back December 6) didn’t resemble the public’s general perception of a violent person. His suit covered up his arm tattoos and his shorter hair, shaven face, and glasses made him look socioeconomically privileged. Although people who harbor far-right views transcend class and educational lines, a perception persists that they are “hillbillies.” And the rise of Trump and the growing racial animus linked to his presidency was famously blamed on the “economic anxiety” of his supporters. (Most Trump voters weren’t poor, though.) Kinsman’s suaver look for his court hearing signals that his defense team potentially gave him a makeover to shoot down the idea that he espouses such views. As it is, the Proud Boys deny that they’re really white supremacists, despite their ties to the far right; the fact that Kinsman is married to a black woman has repeatedly come up on social media and in the press. Proud Boys supporters have used a picture of the couple to shoot down accusations of racism. Kinsman’s black wife, biracial kids, and clean-shaven face could all serve to distract from allegations that he’s a dangerous participant of the far right movement, most recently accused of body slamming, punching and stomping on an Antifa member, according to the New York Post. Kinsman is hardly the first defendant to overhaul his appearance; it’s a common courtroom tactic, particularly in high-profile cases. Jodi Arias, repeatedly portrayed in the press as sexually alluring, appeared in court for the murder of her former boyfriend Travis Alexander with brown hair, glasses, and modest clothing — a complete departure from the blonde-haired and bikini-clad photos of Arias that circulated in the media before the 2013 murder trial, which even Trump weighed in on. The following year, Eric Millerberg, a white supremacist charged with murdering a teen babysitter, got a makeover before appearing in a Utah court. Associated with the racist skinhead movement where members typically shave their heads, Millerberg grew out his hair, shaved his overgrown beard, and got glasses. But for defendants who aren’t involved in high-profile cases or don’t have the funds for a makeover, there’s no opportunity for a full appearance overhaul. This is especially the case with defendants with prominent tattoos. Some of these individuals wear makeup to cover up their body art, but hiring a professional to do so can get expensive, up to $125 daily. And courts don’t always pay the fees associated with tattoos, even if they may prejudice a jury against a defendant. In March, a Texas man named Joseph Tejeda, charged with capital murder, asked the 105th District Court to help him remove or cover up his face tattoos. There have been several other cases in which tattoo removal or cover-up for defendants similarly became an issue. The requests demonstrate the significance of appearance in a courtroom. And while some defendants will be able to transform themselves, as Kinsman has done, those without means will be forced to appear in court in ways that may expose them to jury bias and prevent them from getting a fair trial.

36,36,05-07-17 14:46,2017,7,5,Kamila Rymajdo,This Small City is the Most Exciting Place to Party in the UK Right Now,"This post appeared originally on THUMP UK.Let's try an unusual opening gambit: at the weekends, I'm a bit like Cormac McCarthy protagonist, Llewelyn Moss. He's a fictional welder and I'm a real writer, but we're both on the hunt. He's looking for antelope and I'm after the sesh. Out on our own at the dead of night, the pair of us stumble upon the site of a crime. In his case it's a drug deal gone horribly wrong. In my case, it's an amazing club in Manchester that no one seems to know about.  Let me set the scene. I'm a million miles away from the parched Texan borderlands, deep into Shameless territory. I can't see through the fog and there's no one about to guide me. Eventually, somehow, I make my way to a bar, where I find the last man standing. He must be the bartender. I reveal my weapon of choice. He looks panicked, and I wonder if he's trying to plead with me like Moss' victim does. Actually he's just telling me it's a cash-only bar. Out there on the dancefloor, I can feel eyes burning into me. Is it Anton Chigurh? No, it's just a mate of mine, and they'd rather get back to watching Sega Bodega than hear me try and continue the analogy. It collapses, and we're left in a venue named after a very, very different novel—D.M. Thomas' Freudian erotic fantasy, The White Hotel.  The smog I lost myself in—brightly hued and eerily reminiscent of Ann Veronica Janssens' yellowbluepink installation—was pumping out of what can only be described as a smoke machine on steroids. Pretty much everything here at the Salford space is off-balance; from the under-floor bar to the, shall we say, minimal approach to toilet facilities. With just two stalls to go around as many as 300 punters, it's no surprise that promoters like Manchester institution HomoElectric advise male dancers to ""go outside for a wee, festival styleee."" The White Hotel's been garnering a cult following for some time now, and like nearby club Hidden, it still gives the city's Uber drivers a headache. Both clubs turned disused warehouse spaces into venues bringing Konspiracy-era illicitness to a tired Manchester clubbing scene, ravaged by years of gentrification and disputes with local councils over noise. The location is key—the borough is distant from Manchester's densely populated city centre. Salford council also enforce slightly looser licensing laws than other parts of Manchester due to its physical position. Sitting out there in a kind of no-man's land means that just as the Northern Quarter's Stevenson Square turns into a glorified Instagram opportunity, Salford's nightlife is kicking into fifth gear.  Despite both spaces being tucked away down dank alleys, trouble in the surrounding streets is rare. DJ Black Eyes, who throws an annual 12 hour rave at the White Hotel puts this down to the club's proximity to HM Prison Manchester, a high-security male prison better known as Strangeways. ""You'd have to be completely stupid to cause trouble,"" he tells me. That leads to what Jamie Bull of HomoElectric describes as a clubbing environment with ""fewer rules."" Bull's venture, a gritty-but-glam club night that's taken place in some of the city's most iconic lofts, basements, and dilapidated mansions over the last two decades, now divides itself between the two Salford sites. The appeal is simple; they allow for a more relaxed crowd. ""It's the crowd that don't get dressed up to the nines, it's dressed down for dancing, getting sweaty,"" he explains over Skype. ""Being on the outskirts gives you permission to do that."" Christian Wood is another cult Manchester figure with a predilection for nights out in the area. Known to most as Il Bosco, the man behind esteemed imprint Red Laser Records, Wood's played both clubs, and likens what's going on in Salford today to what was going on during the heydays of rave back in 1991/92. ""It takes balls and foresight to open something like The White Hotel or Hidden, and you can tell from the very act of opening there that the vibe is gonna be leftfield and underground,"" he tells me. ""Plus that dystopian walk up to the door offers its own kind of theater which adds to the feel."" Officially opening two years ago now, there's rumors that the genesis of The White Hotel emerged during illegal raves thrown at Strangeway Studios and the Bunker. The Hotel's owner Ben Ward declined to speak to THUMP, sending us in the direction of the venue's managing partner, the novelist Austin Collings. When asked how the spaces manages to stay commercially viable, he is Collings is refreshingly honest. ""You know when venues and people play the not-for-profit card—but we all know it is really because the next time you see these people they're doused in the latest David Beckham fragrance and they're 33 sheets to the wind on Tesco's Finest Brut—well TWH doesn't even pretend it's not for profit. We are purposefully sinking ourselves into debt and destruction."" An admirable business plan, for sure.  While we're not entirely sure that that's the most sustainable approach to business, it is one that the city's promoters certainly appreciate. ""The people that run these venues have got the right attitude,"" Bull says. ""They're fellow clubbers, music lovers themselves. It's done with some heart and some passion."" DJ Black Eyes shares the sentiment: ""Ben (Ward) is one of the most genuine people I know. You can tell he really enjoys owning the place—he'll go round and talk to people, he'll talk to people in the club, he'll talk to the promoters. I've never seen that anywhere else.""  The five-strong team behind Hidden are dedicated to providing a personal touch, too. We meet at their office one afternoon in June, and director Nickos Arnaoutis immediately begins by singing the praises of Mohammed, the club's airport transfer diver. ""Me and Kris (Arnaoutis' brother and a fellow director) used to get lifts home off him after a night out and he'd always be wearing a suit, he'd be well spoken. We needed a driver so I said, 'would you be up for picking DJs up from the airport for us, representing Hidden?' And he goes so far above and beyond that he'll research the artist a week before, see where they've played, see a bit about them, and he'll be like, 'hello sir, how was it in Berlin?' DJs love it."" The venue, which is an ever-growing network of 600-capacity spaces and artist studios has been lovingly cleaned up but retains its industrial feel. Much like The White Hotel, Hidden was a personal and financial sacrifice since opening in August 2015. With a high-risk booking strategy focused on long-term growth, the club's bookers, Jay Smith and Anton Stevens, found things initially tough. ""You just have to grin and bear it because there is an end-point where, because of the value that you're adding to these people, word kind of spreads and people start seeing that you're doing a good thing,"" explains Stevens. ""We could have gone for certain DJs who we knew would have filled the venue but me and Anton stuck to our guns,"" Smith says. They wanted DJs who might not be massive ticket-sellers, but who'd bring a decent crowd to a new space. They were also helped by engineering a deal with Manchester nightlife mammoths the Warehouse Project, an arrangement that might just have saved Hidden being obliterated by the all-mighty promotion outfit. Stevens, who worked at the superclub before joining the Hidden team recalls, ""what we did was from the start tell the Warehouse Project what was happening, which they really respected. In the past you'd have a battle between Warehouse Project and Sankeys but the Warehouse Project have actually opened a few avenues for us."" Salford's illicit spirit isn't consigned to the two clubs, however. ""About two weeks ago I pulled off the most audacious rave Manchester has seen since the early 90s,"" Il Bosco confesses. ""We had to load a canal boat with the sound system and sail it down the canal to Pomona Island. 400 people turned up and four days later it was still going."" What makes this even more extraordinary is that Pomona is situated a stone's throw away from Salford Quays, home to Manchester's Media City, where the BBC, ITV and Salford University all have sites. While Il Bosco's event was lucky to avoid being shut down by overzealous officers of the law, the continued blurring of the lines of legality are, in part at least, down to the council's belief in the positive impact clubs can have on communities. Hidden's venue manager Martin Moffat explains that, ""councils in different cities have different approaches so we are really lucky. Although in Salford they do make you work for it, as long as you show them that you are working with them then they encourage it, which is refreshing."" Before I leave Hidden, the guys are keen to tell me another anecdote. ""Marcellus Pittman literally canceled his flight just to sit drinking one night,"" Moffat starts. ""He was on the phone to his mates in Detroit like Moodymann and stuff, saying, 'guys I've found the sickest venue and you all need to get over here,' and we were like, he's on the phone to Moodymann, is this real, it's like 6 in the morning,"" Smith continues. ""He called it the new Paradise,"" Arnaoutis concludes proudly. Wood is more cautious about hailing Salford a new clubbing mecca. ""The Red Laser crew spent a weekend at Griessmuehle in Berlin,"" he tells me. ""That's fucking crazy unique and shows even though we are heading in the right direction with clubs like Hidden and The White Hotel leading the way we have a long way to go to match the experiences you get in places like Berlin.""  While he's probably right, it feels good a new chapter is Manchester's rich clubbing history is well under way. Let's just hope it hasn't been written by Cormac McCarthy.   There's a few great nights happening at both venues soon. On the 8th of July there's a day and night party kicking off at Hidden. HomoElectric will be back there on the 26th of August too. That same night sees Lost Control's 12 Hours of Rave bash taking place at The White Hotel. Looking further into the future, the Red Laser squad's Manctaloween party's taking over Atama on the 28th of October. Oh, and Il Bosco's  Bridge Theory  12"" is out now. Phew!

37,37,27-06-19 00:00,2019,6,27,David Shepardson,FCC probes whether Sinclair misled agency during failed Tribune deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shares in Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc fell by 1.6% after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission disclosed it has opened an investigation into whether the company misled the agency in its failed effort to win approval for a $3.9 billion bid to purchase Tribune Media Co.  In a June 25 letter to Sinclair posted Wednesday on the FCC’s website, the government agency’s media bureau directed Sinclair to answer a series of questions by July 9.  On Thursday, the letter had been removed from the FCC’s website.  The FCC did not explain why the letter had been removed but in a statement Thursday said the “Media Bureau is in the process of resolving an outstanding issue regarding Sinclair’s conduct as part of the last year’s FCC’s review of its proposed merger with Tribune. The Bureau believes that delaying consideration of this matter would not be in anyone’s interest.”  Sinclair said Thursday “this is part of an ongoing discussion initiated by Sinclair to work with the FCC to respond to certain allegations raised” last year by the FCC when it referred the issue for a hearing.  Sinclair could face fines from the FCC. In 2017, the FCC fined Sinclair $13.38 million for failing to disclose that programing on local TV stations that looked like news stories was sponsored by a cancer institute.  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said Thursday that “any settlement negotiated behind closed doors will leave us with more questions than answers about one of the nation’s largest broadcasters. The FCC should hold a hearing in public on these questions and do it now.”  Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which has 192 stations, in August. A month earlier the FCC referred the deal for a hearing, questioning Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them.  An administrative judge in March dropped plans for a hearing into allegations that Sinclair may have misled regulators. Judge Jane Halprin added however that the allegations “are extremely serious charges that reasonably warrant a thorough examination.”  U.S. President Donald Trump backed the deal and its collapse potentially ended Sinclair’s hopes of building a national conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox News.  Nexstar Media Group Inc said in December it will buy Tribune in a $4.1 billion deal that would make it the largest regional U.S. TV station operator. The deal is still under review by the Justice Department and the FCC.  In May, Walt Disney Co  said it would sell its interests in 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports to Sinclair for $9.6 billion.

38,38,30-11-17 20:12,2017,11,30,David Saad,"Forget Facebook, Amazon or Google. Up-and-coming top tech talent is opting for startups.","Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — the aptly named FANG companies — are coming under increased scrutiny for their total market dominance. In their respective but more frequently overlapping areas of focus, these giants have collected enough information to hold an alarming amount of global influence. Chief among that, and perhaps most concerning, is the amount of data collected on us, the everyday users. Well past their inflection points, and with every single usage, these companies are woven deeper into the fabric of our lives. Some might even say more emphatically that they have become our everyday lives. Longtime technology follower David Kirkpatrick went as far as to say that the big breakthrough industries of the future will be characterized by meaningful barriers to entry — best-placed for those who own the most data. Groundbreaking innovations that fall within AI — like autonomous cars and specific advances like augmented reality — require significant capital and data, priming those markets for domination by an established core with deep pockets. Implicit in that is the limited space for startups to gain a footing in the market. Just as these juggernauts draw customers with less and less effort, the tipping-point status of their services makes not joining the Big Four feel like being left out, and they will win the war for talent. However, that is not what the view looks like from my position as CEO of a company whose charge is to find and place engineers, designers, product managers and data analysts at technology growth companies — startup tech companies in particular. I am happy to report that “talent” remains liquid. A flight to the top at the world’s most established technology companies is no longer the most sought-after route. This is indeed a different world from even a decade ago, when brilliant MBAs and engineers were often choosing between and opting for Google over Goldman. At that time, this was the ultimate indication of a changing of the guard. So what is giving the rest of the employer world a fighting chance? A smart man once said it’s hard to scale “special.” Keeping your mojo decades post-launch is no small feat, and while these companies have had tremendous impact on a global scale, they are now well past their teenage years and contain more layers. When engineers talk about what they look for in an employer, they often choose the opportunity to be a big fish (hero) in a small shop with grand ambition, over a small fish in a big shop that has already made its mark (a contributor). At the same time, transparency also becomes a challenge in a company of great size. Public-company transparency is one thing, but the transparency that many talented technology executives seek pertains to operations and leadership. They desire the enterprise-wide view that the startup environment provides, and many of them want to have a hand in driving a company’s broader development. The millennial and iGen crowd will soon be a majority in the workforce, and these generations crave a part in the next big thing. The disconnect is that FANG companies are the current big thing. Millennials and iGen believe in the art of the possible and embrace socially-minded missions. This is not to suggest that Google became evil or less socially conscious when, in 2015, it dropped “Don't be evil“ from its core values, but it did create a space for others to carry the torch. Young companies, with founders almost always still in tow, are as passionate a group as you can find. They tell the story of the mission — always prospective at this point in their life cycle — in such an effective way that VCs swoon and new talent wants to walk through fire. Most important is the evolution of the rest of the employer community outside of the obvious technology companies like Netflix or Cisco. Simply stated — by so many we can’t accurately attribute — every company is tech-centric. Technology is now a non-negotiable for enduring success. With these “tech-peripherals” — from giants of the oil industry to health insurers using data analytics to forecast patients most at risk — there are more ways to make a difference with technology than ever before. Engineering, data, design and product talent will always be coveted by companies across tech — the giants and the comers, and increasingly, the tech-peripherals. Make no mistake about it — it is a competitive battle. The FANG companies may very well receive continued criticism from regulators over their growing influence, but from where we sit, the future of innovation remains open to new breeds. How do we know this? Today, very little talent walks in our door and says, ""Can you get me a job at Google?” Rather, they say “Can you get me into the next Google?” David Saad is co-founder and CEO of SingleSprout, a specialized search firm focused on hiring engineering and product talent at tech companies.

40,40,05-06-18 16:30,2018,6,5,Paul Benjamin Osterlund,"Turkey's Death Metal Scene Thrives Despite Government Repression
","It's never been easy to be a metalhead in Turkey, where they're forced to exist under the ominous glare of a conservative culture and a state riddled with authoritarian tendencies. A lack of venues has plagued the country's DIY music scenes even in its biggest cities, and the few that do open their doors to metal music often have terrible sound systems. But these setbacks haven't stopped a vibrant underground metal scene from flourishing in Turkey, where a handful of active groups are playing killer black and death metal. Turkey is firmly under the control of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose AK Parti party has led the country for a decade and a half, dominating the political arena; they've become known for their violent repression of the country's Kurdish population, and lack of hesitation to jail dissidents on the flimsiest of charges (including actual elected members of parliament). Now, a critical election is approaching, one that Erdoğan called over a year early. If elected again, he will preside over a newly-installed presidential system designed to grant him even more power, and the suffocating chokehold he has over the country will remain for years to come. Add all that to a Turkish lira that has been plummeting rapidly this year, and you get an atmosphere that feels mildly apocalyptic—something that has bled into its underground metal scene. Despite its authoritarian government, Turkey is no Turkmenistan or North Korea, and there is still just enough freedom and space for underground scenes to thrive. The vitality of the underground metal scene was no more evident than at a recent festival in Ankara that brought 14 bands to the stage over the course of two days. Hundreds of metalheads came out, many traveling from cultural capital Istanbul. Showcased were among some of the country's best active metal units, who delivered passionate and thunderous performances in a basement rock bar where the stage was buttressed with a row of barrels that seemed to encourage stage-diving and crowd surfing. Not every band featured below appeared at the festival that weekend, but all are among the most important and exciting of their kind active today. Though opportunities to play are indeed few and far between, this hasn't thwarted Turkey's underground metal groups from cultivating a rich scene. They rage on.  Perhaps the most brutal performance of the weekend came from Engulfed, an Istanbul death metal quartet that formed in 2010. Hot off 2017's debut LP,  Engulfed in Obscurity, the band ripped through an airtight set and sounded like a pack of speed-addled rhinos pounding down a dusty road. Vocalist/bassist Serkan elaborately described the band's sound as, “the noise you hear while being dragged inside a dark tunnel, when everything positive in the universe is annihilated within eternal darkness, while taking pleasure in suffering and when everything sacred is being mercilessly destroyed.”  The band's usually frenetic pace is punctuated by slow, grim breakdowns laced with demonically appealing leads. Serkan cites visa problems as being one of the major inhibitors of the scene, preventing Turkish band from showcasing their sound abroad (Turks have to apply for Schengen visas to visit Europe; the application fees are expensive and arbitrary rejections are common.) Nevertheless, he appreciates the close-knit ties that bind the scene together and keep them motivated. “The numbers are small, but we have a metal scene composed of friends that are totally connected and look out for one another,” Serkan says.  Another powerfully talented Istanbul death metal outdit, Diabolizer, shares two members with Engulfed but opts to take more of a gratuitous, exuberant approach that doesn't lack in brutality. Their most recent effort is 2016's bruiser   Apokalypse  EP. Defiant, cackling melodic guitar parts dance effortlessly around a bottomless pit of doom. Headbangers in Ankara and Istanbul have been fortunate enough to catch the dazzling Diabolizer on stage at recent shows this year.  Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited band of the festival was Burial Invocation, which was formed in 2008 with roots in both Istanbul and Ankara. The four-piece's hotly anticipated debut full-length, Abiogenesis, is slated to come out later this year and blends savage vocals with manic drum work and impressive guitar trickery slathered in alternating dollops of brutality and melodic brilliance. European metalheads will be fortunate to catch the band across a number of countries on their tour of the continent in September and October of this year. “In my opinion, being a metalhead in Turkey is great; there are a number of great albums that will be released soon and some fantastic shows coming up,” says guitarist Cihan. “There are both new and old bands, the attendance at shows is good, and they are more soulful and fun than the underground shows I've seen in Europe."" Laying down a raw, sharp blend of death metal that blends power and precision, Hellsodomy (which also shares members with Engulfed and toured Europe together last year) is yet another mainstay of Turkey's underground metal scene. Their 2016 eight-song full length,  Chaostorm, is a barrage of throat-shredding vocals, skull-pounding drums, and razor-sharp solos. “There has been an increase in the attendance of shows, at every show there are people we haven't seen before. Though in a city of 15 million, the number of people coming out to a show is around 150. In a country with 81 provinces, we can only play in five,” guitarist Yunus says. On the positive side, “we've created this fantastic world within our own realm and are working to take things to the next level."" Described by vocalist Çağatay as “twisted, malignant metal” that will appeal to fans of black, death and thrash metal, Persecutory formed in Istanbul in 2014. After a year and a half hiatus, they roared back to the stage with an intense, memorable performance at the Ankara festival. Their debut LP,   Towards an Ultimate Extinction,  wastes no time descending into pure chaos and mayhem, laying the foundation for an absolutely catastrophic sound formed around Çagatay's anguished, searing vocals. “Being a metalhead is not a hobby for me, it's an identity,” Çağatay says, adding that many people in the scene end up losing interest entirely and then chastise active metalheads for their ongoing commitment. “Apart from three or four small bars that we've played at, venue owners don't take metal shows seriously and do not want to host them,” he adds.  Sarinvomit's sound is as vile and dark as its name implies. Sharing vocalists with Persecutory, this Istanbul unit is hot off the release of their debut,   Malignant Thermonuclear Supremacy, a throttling, crackbrained blend of extreme metal. Here, bloodthirsty vocals, battleaxe guitars, and blastbeats that make even the listener's wrists feel sore converge in a truly punishing fashion.  Long-running scene stalwarts Decaying Purity have been at it since 2005, enduring a number of lineup changes while amassing several releases and appearing at various festivals across Europe. The band, which describes its sound as “sickeningly brutal death metal punishment,” most recently released   Malignant Resurrection of the Fallen Souls,  a raging beast of an affair with filthy, venomous vocals and the impressive riff-repertoire of co-founder Mustafa, who also plays in Engulfed and Diabolizer. A new recording is reportedly in the works. Paul Benjamin Osterlund is a writer based in Istanbul; follow him on Twitter.

Not anymore! On September 15, Yellowstone Park’s Ear Spring geyser erupted, belching not just rocks and scalding hot water into the air, but dozens of pieces of human trash that were cooked for decades in incredibly hot water. Nice!  The National Park Service shared a picture of some of the artifacts recovered, which it claims are “clearly historic” and may end up in Yellowstone’s archives. The picture clearly shows a baby pacifier, a Solo Jazz cup, a plastic spoon, and some sort of tablet-like electronic device destroyed beyond recognition. There also seems to be a large slab of concrete or a cinder block.  “Foreign objects can damage hot springs and geysers,” representatives from the National Park Service said in a Facebook post. “You can help by never throwing anything into Yellowstone's thermal features!”  You would think it goes without saying, but yes, please do not hurl your trash into a scalding hot spring in the largest National Park in the country. If you’re thinking “Maybe I’ll throw just a little trash into the geyser,” No. Do not throw even a little trash into the geyser.  The National Park Service shared a photo of several dozen coins that were thrown into the geyer and were consequently scorched beyond recognition. Throwing your currency into a geyser will not bring you good luck. Do not throw your coins into a geyser.  If you would like to behold the mighty geyser sputtering human trash through the air, a video of the eruption is included below.

43,43,28-06-18 00:00,2018,6,28,"Matthew Miller, Michael Martina, David Shepardson",Exclusive: China shuns U.S. request for talks on airline website dispute over Taiwan,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has rejected U.S. requests for talks over how U.S. airlines and their websites refer to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, according to sources, including a U.S. official, adding to tensions in a relationship already frayed by a major trade dispute.  China has demanded that foreign firms, and airlines in particular, begin referring to Taiwan as Chinese territory on their websites, along with Hong Kong and Macau, a move described by the White House in May as “Orwellian nonsense”.   Numerous non-U.S. carriers, such as Air Canada, Lufthansa and British Airways have already made changes to their websites, according to Reuters checks.  But several U.S. companies, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, were among carriers that sought extensions to a May 25 deadline to make the changes. The final deadline is July 25.   In late May, the U.S. State Department presented China’s Foreign Ministry with a diplomatic note requesting consultations on the matter, but the ministry has since refused it, two sources briefed on the situation told Reuters.  “This has definitely become a foreign policy issue,” one of the sources said on condition of anonymity, noting that the U.S. government did not view it as a technical matter for bilateral aviation cooperation.    The spat had become “another grain of sand in the wound” amid escalating trade tensions, a second source said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports to punish Beijing for intellectual property abuses.   An official with the State Department confirmed to Reuters that China had rejected its request for talks on June 25, adding that it was “disappointed” and had maintained close communication with the airlines but had not told them how to respond to Beijing’s demands.  “U.S. airlines should not be forced to comply with this order,” the State Department official said. “We have called on China to stop threatening and coercing American companies and citizens.”   Chinese companies are free to operate their websites without political interference in the United States, the official added.  China’s rebuff has left the U.S. government weighing its next move. The White House convened a staff-level meeting on the issue on Wednesday, but it is not clear what it plans to do.  Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously.  Armed by the United States, Taiwan has always been a major source of tension between Beijing and Washington, but it has been an increasingly contentious issue since Trump took office.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the rejection of discussing the issue with the United States, reiterated that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China and that this was the consensus of the international community.  Foreign companies in China must respect China’s law and the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he told a daily news briefing on Thursday.  Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrew H.C. Lee, said China’s demands over the issue “have reached new levels of hysteria”.   “Taiwan is grateful to the efforts of like-minded countries that have chosen to take a stand against Chinese bullying of private enterprises,” he said.  The companies have little incentive to defy Chinese regulations, but compliance could put them at odds with U.S. foreign policy.  Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday that the airline was working with the U.S. government but would not say whether it would comply.  “We’re working with the U.S. authorities on the topic and we’ll stay close to our U.S. government,” Bastian said, calling it a “good plan of action”.  The chief executive of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, told Reuters in Washington on June 7 that the website issue was a “government-to-government diplomatic issue and again we’ll see what comes out of that and we’ll react accordingly”.  Asked if he would defer to the White House, Munoz said that “I fly to both places and I am deferential to our customers, and again this is not something I am going to solve”.  American Airlines said in early June that it had not made changes on its website, and that it was following the direction of the U.S. government.  It is unclear how China might seek to punish airlines that do not comply. But in December it changed rules governing foreign airlines operating in the country, including adding a clause that regulators could change a company’s permit if it did not meet “the demand of public interest”.

45,45,27-07-18 00:00,2018,7,27,Tim Hume,Mass protests have erupted in Poland ,"Thousands of Poles took to the streets in mass demonstrations Thursday, after the president signed into law a new measure tightening the nationalist ruling party’s grip on the Supreme Court. Protesters gathered in front of Warsaw’s presidential palace and in more than 20 other cities and towns, chanting “Free courts” and “Shame.” Some held pens, a dig at President Andrzej Duda's willingness to sign off on the controversial amendment. Police used pepper spray on demonstrators who wrote slogans on the pavement in Warsaw. The new law is the latest in a series of judicial reforms by Poland’s nationalist government, which have sparked concerns over the independence of the judiciary and brought Warsaw into a tense standoff with Brussels. The amendment will effectively allow the nationalist Law and Justice-led government to choose the next Supreme Court chief. The measure follows reforms earlier this month that critics – including the court’s chief justice – labeled a “purge.” The government’s controversial move to lower the retirement age for the court’s judges to 65 from 70 forced about a third of them from the bench, and sparked widespread protests. Critics, including the European Union, said the move would result in the court being stacked with judges subservient to the government.

READ:   Poland’s nationalist government is cracking down on protesters – unless they’re far-right Since coming into power in 2015, the Law and Justice party has set about rapidly reshaping Poland in line with its nationalist agenda, promoting traditional conservative values over those of the country’s liberal elite, and working to wrest power from Brussels to restore national control over the country’s affairs. One report by pro-democracy think tank Freedom House said Law and Justice had transformed the Polish landscape “at breakneck speed, and in violation of the country’s own laws.”  Among other changes to Poland’s institutions, Law and Justice has removed dozens of judges from the country’s courts and tribunals. The party, which has long demonized the judiciary, says its overhauls are necessary to make the courts more efficient, and to uproot the legacy of Poland’s Communist past. “Without reforms, we cannot rebuild the Polish state so that it serves its citizens,” said party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The moves have brought Poland into a confrontation with the European Union, which trained the most powerful political weapon in its arsenal on Warsaw in December when it invoked, for the first time in its history, Article 7 of its founding treaty over Poland’s judicial reforms. Under that process, considered the EU’s “nuclear option,” Poland faces being stripped of its voting rights in the EU. But that would require unanimous approval by other member states, and Hungary, governed by another nationalist and euroskeptic party, has vowed to block any such move.

Ireland’s High Court had expressed reservations that the case could be compromised by the situation in Poland, and that the ruling will give other EU countries a legal basis to reject Polish extradition requests in the future.

46,46,05-10-16 19:00,2016,10,5,Tara Golshan,"How the Clinton campaign is making #ThatMexicanThing a thing, explained","Sen. Tim Kaine made a point during the vice presidential debate of reminding the American public of that time Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers. “He started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals,” Kaine said, listing Trump’s most controversial campaign statements. “I cannot imagine how Gov. Pence can defend Donald Trump.” At first, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence responded with a laugh and a shrug — a seemingly implicit defense of Trump implying Kaine’s attack was unfounded (despite the fact that Trump really has said these things). But Pence’s initial lack of response didn’t stop Kaine. He used the same line four times Tuesday night. And by the fourth time, Pence had had enough. “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,” Pence retorted. “There are criminal aliens who have come into this country illegally, who are perpetrating violence. He also said, ‘and many of them are good people.’ Sen. Kaine, you keep leaving them out of your quote.” “That Mexican thing” was an unusually inarticulate moment for Pence that night, and Twitter noticed. Soon the hashtag #ThatMexicanThing was trending on Twitter. Figuring out what to do for lunch. Might do #thatMexicanthing on the corner. As Univision’s Jorge Ramos pointed out, it is an even more unfortunate turn of phrase for the vice president of a candidate that has had an extremely difficult time energizing the Latino vote: First Trump calls Mexicans ""rapists"". Now Pence says #ThatMexicanThing Question: Is that a creative strategy to win the Latino vote? Hillary Clinton supporters used it to express “things” Mexican immigrants actually do — work hard, play by the rules, pay taxes, participate in civic life as Americans, and so on. #ThatMexicanThing where undocumented immigrants pay more taxes than @realDonaldTrump does. #VPDebate #thatmexicanthing is my mom who immigrated to this country, pays her taxes and put two kids through college while managing a business ❤️ Look at me, I'm #ThatMexicanThing that has served in the military and graduated college. #NeverTrumpPence As Republican strategist Ana Navarro notes, Pence’s offhand remark has become a rallying cry for Mexican Americans to highlight their life experiences in the United States, in the face of Trump and Pence’s immigration-skeptical policy proposals. Latino Twitter abuzz. #ThatMexicanThing now a hashtag Mexican-Americans using to share stories on American dream/work ethic/sacrifices made. https://t.co/HgrfWJrpD9 The Clinton campaign also seized on it quickly: www.thatMexicanthing.com now redirects to Hillary Clinton’s campaign website, and Clinton’s campaign is doing its darnedest to make the hashtag #ThatMexicanThing the takeaway from Tuesday’s debate. It’s an illustration of just how savvy campaigns can be in the face of a losing performance, but it is also a reflection of what Kaine was trying do all night: sink Pence down to Trump’s level. If the Clinton campaign succeeds in elevating this debate moment, Kaine’s otherwise damaging interruptions will not have been enacted in vain. Kaine’s strategy was to make Pence defend Trump. It didn’t play out like he hoped, unless this works. Kaine’s finest moments in the debate were when he listed Trump’s most reprehensible campaign moments — but a lot of them were undermined by his overeagerness to jump into the role of attack dog. He interrupted Pence often, interjecting with Trump’s past transgressions. It gave Republicans fodder for a simple post-debate attack video, creating a supercut of all the times Kaine jumped in on Pence’s time. This allowed Republicans to create space for the argument that there’s nothing sexist about the way Trump interrupted Clinton last week at the first debate since her running mate used the same tactic. But Pence’s inarticulate moment also highlighted the fact that he had no intention of defending Trump. One of the few times he tried to became a memeable moment, which the Clinton campaign has been quick to co-opt. Pence’s retort didn’t age well overnight, as media outlets begin to pick up on it on Wednesday and the Clinton campaign continues to push it as Tuesday’s takeaway. Ultimately, Pence’s remark may not matter in the grand scheme of the election, as vice presidential debates so often don’t, but it undermines a real opportunity for the Trump campaign — a potentially positive news cycle for the first time in more than a week.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/5/13174186/clinton-pence-thatmexicanthing-explained,,Vox
47,47,05-03-19 18:20,2019,3,5,Gaby Del Valle,Virgin Atlantic uniform: flight attendants no longer have to wear makeup,"Virgin Atlantic is no longer requiring women flight attendants to wear makeup — and, for the first time, they’ll be offered pants as part of their default uniform. In the past, the airline’s standards for women who worked on board were fairly stringent: The airline reportedly has a style guide for flight attendants that includes instructions on what types of makeup they are and aren’t allowed to wear, and women were only provided trousers for their uniforms upon request. The airline is framing the move as a push toward gender equality in a line of work that remains heavily divided along gender lines: Most pilots are still men and most flight attendants are still women. “Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves at work,” Virgin Atlantic executive VP Mark Anderson told CNN in a statement. “Our world-famous red uniform is something all of us at Virgin Atlantic are incredibly proud of. As an airline, we have always stood out from the crowd and done things differently to the rest of the industry. We want our uniform to truly reflect who we are as individuals while maintaining that famous Virgin Atlantic style.” While the new guidelines allow crew members to opt out of wearing makeup, those who choose to do so will still have to adhere to Virgin’s style guide. The new guidelines also underscore how strictly flight attendants’ appearances are enforced to this day — and the extent to which the aviation industry continues to play into outdated gender stereotypes. It’s worth noting that although flight attendants in general are expected to adhere to rigid gender norms, there is a rich history of queer flight attendants — last year, Virgin offered its first-ever Pride flight to New York City, which was entirely staffed by LGBT employees — but the industry continues to uphold rigid gender norms. As gender sociologist Lisa Wade has noted, the first flight attendants were men, and early airlines often had bans on hiring women. But the profession quickly became dominated by women, who were expected to play the role of cheerful domestic worker and sexpot to appeal to largely male travelers. A post shared by Virgin Atlantic (@virginatlantic) on Oct 30, 2018 at 11:36am PDT Even today, the overwhelming majority of flight attendants are women, and most airlines, especially those that provide luxury services, still require their cabin crews to adhere to strict dress codes. In a 2018 interview with Town and Country, an Emirates flight attendant revealed that the airline has rules for what colors of nail polish employees are allowed to wear, as well as guidelines for lipstick — which is required — eye makeup, jewelry, and hair styles. Cosmopolitan compiled a list of different airlines’ requirements, which range from standard things like customer service to more outlandish rules like how much flight attendants can weigh, what range their body mass index should fall into, and how long their nails should be. American Airlines reportedly requires cabin crew members to “cut or otherwise remove” “noticeable hair in nostrils and/in on ears or underarms.” JetBlue employees are allowed to put their hair in ponytails, but they “should be no higher than the tops of the ears and no longer than the tops of the shoulders.” The list goes on and on. Virgin’s relaxed rules could be a sign of broader change. The airline called the move a “significant change for the aviation industry,” something that would normally sound like brand-speak, but in this case seems to be true.",https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/5/18251839/virgin-atlantic-uniform-makeup-skirts,,Vox

Oil prices rose on Monday, extending large gains last week that were prompted by tensions between the United States and Iran, although concerns about the possibility of weakening demand kept a lid on gains.  Strong growth in the price of U.S. shale oil has also contained stronger increases, the IEA’s Fatih Birol added on Monday.  “We are monitoring the situation very closely and are very worried. In case of physical disruption, we are ready to act in an appropriate way,” Birol told a news conference at the IEA’s annual energy efficiency conference in Dublin.  Last week, benchmark Brent crude climbed 5% and U.S. crude < CLc1> surged 10% after Iran shot down a U.S. drone on Thursday in the Gulf, adding to strains stoked by attacks on oil tankers in the area in May and June that Washington has blamed on Iran.  Iran denies any role in the tanker attacks.  Birol said earlier this month that the attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which stoked concern of reduced flows of crude on one of the world’s key shipping routes, threatened global energy security.   However on Monday he cited the strength of U.S. shale oil prices for supporting the market, similar to the buffer it provided through U.S. sanctions imposed on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela.  “This would definitely have bad implications for the global economy but despite those attacks, we have not seen a major impact on the prices and the main reason is United States shale oil prices are growing so strongly that there is a lot of oil in the markets now,” he said.   “It provides a ceiling on the price hikes which is very good news for consumers around the world.”  Reporting by Padraic Halpin, editing by Louise Heavens",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iea-energy/iea-concerned-about-middle-east-tensions-stands-ready-to-act-idUSKCN1TP1MY,Davos,Reuters

It was one of the largest groups of names disclosed by the church as it faces U.S. state and federal investigations into its handling of decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by priests.   The names were posted online by the state’s 15 Catholic dioceses and follow an August grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailing seven decades of abuse of thousands of children by more than 300 priests.   “The Bishops of Texas have decided to release the names of these priests at this time because it is right and just and to offer healing and hope to those who have suffered,” said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Galveston-Houston diocese, who is also president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.  In the months after the Pennsylvania report, dozens of other dioceses around the United States have released the names of hundreds of priests and others accused of abuse. Some states have opened their own investigations into the church.   Texas’ Catholic dioceses have been in the spotlight since November when authorities searched the offices of the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston looking for documents related to a priest charged in September with sex crimes.  About 30 percent of Texas’ population, or 8.5 million people, identify as Catholics, one of the highest rates for any U.S. state, according to the USCCB.  Some of the 15 Texas dioceses listed priests accused of abuse going back as far as the 1940s. Others like Laredo only went back to 2000, when it was created, and listed no names.   It was not clear whether the release of names would result in prosecutors bringing charges.

52,52,07-04-17 00:00,2017,4,7,Dustin Volz,U.S. lawmakers ask for disclosure of number of Americans under surveillance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee on Friday asked the Trump administration to disclose an estimate of the number of Americans whose digital communications are incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  Such an estimate is “crucial as we contemplate reauthorization,” of parts of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are due to expire at the end of the year, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican, and John Conyers, the panel’s top Democrat, wrote in a letter addressed to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.  The request comes as some Republican lawmakers, many of whom have stridently defended U.S. surveillance programs in the past, express sudden interest in considering additional privacy safeguards to how U.S. spy agencies collect and share intelligence that contains information about Americans.  That interest has been sparked by evolving, unsubstantiated assertions that the Obama White House used surveillance powers to improperly spy on the incoming Trump administration.  Privacy advocates have for years demanded that the U.S. government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under a certain part of FISA, known as Section 702, that allows for the collection of vast quantities of internet communications from foreigners believed to be living overseas.   Some experts and lawmakers have said they believe data on  millions of Americans could be caught under such surveillance, exposing them to warrantless searches by federal investigators.  “It is clear that Section 702 surveillance programs can and do collect information about U.S. persons, on subjects unrelated to counter-terrorism,” wrote Goodlatte and Conyers, who requested a response by April 24. “It is imperative that we understand the size of this impact on U.S. persons as our committee proceeds with the debate on reauthorization.”  In a separate letter sent last December to the outgoing Obama administration, members of the House Judiciary Committee said they were given assurances by officials that an estimate would be provided, likely by January of this year.  Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said “yes” when asked by a Reuters reporter last month whether an estimate would be provided before year end. He also said about 20 “vignettes” would be publicly released that show the important national security value of Section 702, which officials have described as among the most important intelligence tools at their disposal.  Section 702 will expire on Dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action.

Now it's going to lead to a special made-for-TV run-off tonight. The U.S. women's 4x100 meter relay was disqualified from the semifinal heat this morning after Allyson Felix dropped the baton during a handoff with English Gardner after running the second leg. It looked like another embarrassing outcome for the U.S. relay team. The women's 4x100 team dropped the baton in 2004 and 2008, while the men's team did it in 2008 and 2012. But the U.S. team filed a protest, saying that a Brazilian runner had crowded into the US lane and bumped Felix, causing her to drop the baton. And guess what? It actually worked! Now the U.S. will run again Thursday night at 7 p.m. Eastern time to try to make the finals. They just have to beat the eighth place time—42.70 seconds by China. But it's also going to be weird. The U.S. will run alone around the track. Just them and an entire stadium watching. ""I think I got propelled at about 20 miles an hour,"" Felix said. ""When a foreign object comes in front of you, it's going to mess up the momentum and the handover."" Just one more wrinkle though: It could get even weirder and tense. If the U.S. does beat the threshold to qualify for the finals, then China and Canada will have to race again to decide who the eighth place team is. So, basically: Tune in, tonight is going to be a lot of fun.

55,55,10-06-19 00:00,2019,6,10,"Rod Nickel, Nia Williams",RPT-Aging Enbridge oil pipelines face setbacks over fears of Great Lakes spills,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta, June 9 (Reuters) - F ears about oil spills into the Great Lakes from two aging U.S. pipelines have flared, raising doubts about their future and creating fresh headaches for operator Enbridge Inc and the Canadian energy sector.  Canada has faced years of delay in getting new oil pipelines built because of environmental opposition, resulting in severe congestion in Alberta, the country’s main crude-producing province, that forced the provincial government to impose production cuts this year. Pipelines face increasing scrutiny from environmental groups worried about leaks, and U.S. Great Lakes states are taking a hard look at the risks.  The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on June 3 that the environmental impact statement for Enbridge’s Line 3 failed to properly address the spill risk in Lake Superior, imposing a fresh challenge to the company’s construction schedule. Also last week, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer repeated a threat to shut down Line 5 unless Enbridge accelerated its timeline to replace it.  “That is a real-time problem because (Line 3) was the most imminent chance for Canadian production to see some pressure release on the system,” said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, which owns shares of Canadian Natural Resources and other oil producers. “It’s disappointing and concerning.”  Enbridge shares dropped 5 percent in Toronto last week, hovering near a three-month low.  Line 3 carries oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Line 5 takes oil from Wisconsin to refineries in Sarnia, Ontario, passing through the Straits of Mackinac channel connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Both were built in the 1960s.  In a statement on Friday, Enbridge said it was still analyzing the court’s decision on Line 3.  Without a valid environment statement, Enbridge’s certificate of need and route permit, which it received from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) a year ago over boisterous opposition, are void.  Minnesota’s Department of Commerce and Enbridge must now re-draft the statement to the PUC’s satisfaction, a process likely to take at least six months, said Alexandra Klass, a University of Minnesota law professor.  Enbridge has previously said it expects to have the remaining Minnesota permits for Line 3 by November and will put it into service in the second half of 2020. It has not said how the appeal court’s ruling may now affect that plan.  “As of now they do not have any valid state permits,” Klass said. “I don’t know their construction schedule, but it does seem ambitious.”  PUC officials declined to comment.  With no valid environment statement, Minnesota’s natural resources department and pollution control agency cannot issue the required state permits either, said Scott Strand, lawyer for the Friends of the Headwaters environmental group.  “It doesn’t seem likely that the calendar can just stay in place,” he said.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency must issue Line 3’s water quality certification by Oct. 30 or Enbridge would need to re-apply, re-starting a year-long process, said spokesman Darin Broton.  Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources said in a statement that it was determining its next steps.  In Michigan, Enbridge said it is taking legal action regarding Line 5 to enforce agreements with a previous Michigan administration that allowed it to build a tunnel under the Straits to replace an underwater section of pipe. The governor has said she fears anchors from boats could rupture the existing pipe.  Whitmer’s insistence on shutting down Line 5 in two years, ahead of the 2024 completion date for the tunnel, led to Enbridge’s legal action, the company said.  Whitmer wrote to Enbridge CEO Al Monaco on Monday saying that she wants a firm date to shut down the underwater portion of the pipeline, and that the state could otherwise shut down Line 5. She did not comment further on Friday.

56,56,01-07-19 00:00,2019,7,1,Justin George Varghese,WPP in exclusive talks to sell Kantar stake to Bain Capital,"(Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) is in exclusive talks to sell a majority stake in its data analytics unit Kantar to private equity firm Bain Capital, it said on Monday, in a $4 billion deal aimed at steering the world’s biggest advertising company back to growth.   The news puts an end to months of speculation around the heavily-contested auction which drew interest from a broad spectrum of buyout firms that are flush with cash to invest.   WPP had shortlisted a series of U.S. buyout funds to submit binding bids for a majority stake in Kantar including Apollo and Platinum, Reuters reported in May.  The auction, led by Goldman Sachs and part of the company’s efforts to raise cash, kicked off last year and also drew interest from European private equity houses CVC Capital Partners and Permira.  In a statement on Monday, WPP said Kantar was valued at $4 billion including debt. Bain’s proposal was subject to negotiation and it was not certain the talks would result in a deal, the company said.  Shares of WPP closed up 2.2% at 1,012 pence on Monday after media reports reported earlier in the day that Bain emerged as the leading bidder.  Bain’s interest in Kantar is the latest private equity deal to emerge in recent weeks. Blackstone and Lego’s founding family on Friday took Merlin Entertainments (MERL.L) private in a $7.5 billion deal, in one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe in recent years.  Nestle (NESN.S) also said in May it was in exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.33 billion).  Kantar’s underlying sales fell 2% last year to 2.6 billion pounds with operating profit down 14% to 301 million pounds.  The business generates about 15% of WPP’s overall sales and provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers.   It has traditionally weighed on WPP’s overall organic growth rates - a key measurement for the industry.  Analysts say Kantar risks losing market share to more tech-savvy peers, while its business model is challenged by consumer goods companies developing their own data teams, rather than relying on surveys undertaken by external firms.  First-quarter results in April showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018.  WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and turmoil linked to founder Martin Sorrell’s abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.  With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.  WPP’s Mark Read, who took the helm of the 12-billion pound advertising giant last year, has pledged to spend 300 million pounds restructuring the group to bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021.  Read, a soft-spoken executive who worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to return the company to growth.

57,57,16-10-17 00:00,2017,10,16,"James Oliphant, Roberta Rampton",Trump keeping options open as Republican feud rages,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Like the deal-maker he says he is, U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be keeping his options open as his Republican Party threatens to erupt into full-scale war.   On Monday, almost immediately after saying he empathized with the effort by his former strategist Steve Bannon to back challenges against Republican senators in next year’s congressional elections, Trump stood with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, pledging party unity and saying they were “fighting for the same thing.”  For months, McConnell had been the object of Trump’s wrath for the failure of the Republican-led Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare - a longtime Republican goal and a key promise of Trump’s 2016 campaign.  In the White House Rose Garden, Trump played down any conflict, saying the two were “closer than ever before.”  But Trump would not disavow Bannon’s pledge to take down Republicans who are not fully behind Trump’s agenda and to drive McConnell from the Senate’s leadership.  Bannon, who helped mastermind Trump’s election campaign but left the White House in August, appeared at a gathering of conservative activists on Saturday and declared: “Right now, it’s a season of war against a GOP establishment.”  In comments directed at McConnell, Bannon told the gathering: “Up on Capitol Hill, it’s like the Ides of March. They’re just looking to find out who is going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar.”  Brutus, once an ally of Caesar, was among the assassins of the Roman leader on the Ides of March in 44 B.C.  Working with well-funded outside political groups, Bannon is encouraging anti-establishment candidates to challenge Republican incumbents in the party’s nominating races for the 2018 elections in which all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate are up for election.  Republican leaders, such as McConnell, worry that the anti-establishment candidates might be less palatable to general election voters and cause Republicans to lose their majority in the Senate and possibly also the House.  Asked about Bannon before a meeting of his Cabinet on Monday, Trump said he could “understand where Steve Bannon’s coming from” and took a jab at the Republican-led Congress in the process.   “We’re not getting the job done,” Trump said. “And I’m not going to blame myself, I’ll be honest. They are not getting the job done.”  At the later news conference with McConnell, Trump said, however, he may try to persuade Bannon not to back primary challengers in several upcoming congressional races.  “Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing,” Trump said. “Some of the people that he may be looking at (challenging), I’m going to see if we talk him out of that, because frankly, they’re great people.”  Still, when McConnell went further, criticizing Bannon for favoring fringe candidates who cannot “appeal to a broader electorate,” Trump was noticeably silent.  Trump is still stinging from his decision to support the Republican incumbent in the recent Alabama Senate primary, Luther Strange, at McConnell’s behest. Strange was beaten handily by arch-conservative Roy Moore, the challenger backed by Bannon.   While it has been unusual for a president to support a primary challenger in his own party, Trump has signaled he may be willing to do so in states such as Arizona, where Senator Jeff Flake, up for re-election next year, has been critical of the White House.

58,58,02-03-16 00:00,2016,3,2,Elisa Wouk Almino,Marcel Broodthaers's Fraught Relationship with Words,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Do words limit our experience of a given artwork? Gustave Flaubert believed that, “Explaining one artistic form by means of another is a monstrosity.” Art critic John Berger wrote: “When words are applied to visual art, both lose precision.” And what if the words are in the art? Expressed by the artist herself? From Cubism to conceptual art, the 20th century saw a spike in the appropriation of words in visual expression. Of course, there are earlier examples, like illuminated manuscripts, Egyptian hieroglyphs, or the works of visual poets like William Blake. But it was in the 1960s especially that the boundaries between the seemingly distinct art forms really began to blur. Marcel Broodthaers was a product of this time. Currently having a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Belgian is hailed for being innovative with written and visual language, borrowing from Marcel Duchamp, René Magritte (a contemporary and friend), and Pop art, while giving these influences a new twist. Let’s start with Broodthaers’s first work of art, which he made at the age of 40, when he decided to move on from writing poetry. Well, sort of. He took unsold copies of his most recent collection of poetry, Pense-Bête (“Memory Aid”) (1964), and encased them in plaster and egg shells so that they hardened into monuments and useless objects. At MoMA, one of these books is placed near an invitation to his first exhibition: a series of magazine spreads that Broodthaers painted over with the words, “I, too, wondered whether I couldn’t sell something …” The start of his visual art career is marked by a bitterness, and even a sense of revenge, that never really goes away. In addition to eggshells, Broodthaers had a penchant for mussel shells. These remnants appear in dense geometric patterns, spilling out of pots, crammed into a cabinet, or piled on a chair. At times, he is heavy-handed or obvious in his symbolism, fixing egg shells to the Belgian flag or smearing black, explosive globs of manufactured eggs on a newspaper reporting Belgium’s 1960 invasion of Congo. These works surround you with noisy clutter that is resoundingly empty, recalling the art that copied and critiqued consumer culture at the time. The MoMA likes to stress that Broodthaers “distanced his photographic reproductions from those of Pop” by copying his own works. The results, however, are generally less than inspiring, including a display of glass bottles that he painted words over, set before a photograph of those same objects. In a concurrent Broodthaers exhibition titled, appropriately, Écriture at Michael Werner, three sheets of paper, each placed in individual typewriters, read, from left to right: “Parle,” “Ecrit,” “Copie” (“Speak,” “Write,” “Copy”). He seems to say that words, like images, in being reproduced, risk their originality. With both existing in the same systems of meaning, Broodthaers believed that “The language of forms must reunite with that of words.” At its most stimulating, his work reflects on how we understand the world through words and images, and how we fit them into one another. Which contains which? In one series, Broodthaers transforms the words of Stéphane Mallarmé’s poem “A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance” (1897) into sleek bars of various thicknesses and lengths. In another, he pairs objects, à la Magritte, with poetic, unusual, and surreal written associations: “style” with a glass bottle; “subject” with a hat; “pipe” with a palette. Similarly, in Series in the French Language (1972), Broodthaers matches the names of well-known writers and artists with unexpected or even inaccurate descriptors that often switch the roles of the writer and visual artist, such as “Charles Baudelaire Peint” (“Charles Baudelaire Paints”). Like Henri Michaux (another Belgian poet-artist), Broodthaers made words painterly subjects by scribbling letters and sentences on canvases. At times, he even used words in protest of images — in response to Minimalism, where form reigned supreme, he writes, in the 1968 oil on canvas work of the same name: “there are no primary structures.” For him, it was words that underly creation and give shape to images. “An artist does not construct a volume. He writes a volume,” he said. The latter work is featured in his Musée d’Art Moderne, Département des Aigles (Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles), a traveling conceptual museum that Broodthaers developed between 1968 and 1971. Here we see a series of pamphlets and letters declaring his vision for the project that re-appropriates and mocks the museum as an institution. In one of his “décors,” or sets alluding to the privileged rooms of the bourgeoisie, titled “Un Jardin d’Hiver II” (“Winter Garden II,” 1974), he created a room of palm trees where pictures of exotic birds hang on the wall, alluding to the colonialist origins of museums. Why eagles? We are brought back to a poem of his that opens the exhibition: “O sadness assent of wild ducks / Assault of birds at the forest granary / O Melancholy bitter castle of eagles.” As a MoMA label says, the eagle is “a bird that symbolizes autonomy and solitude, and which had come to represent the artist.” I cannot help but see his bitter castle as his attempt to establish some sense of authority, of payback for not earning the success he felt he deserved as a writer. Beneath his art lies a fervid will for and insistence on writing. In the video “La pluie (projet pour un texte),” we see him writing in a downpour, unfazed and triumphant. In “La Salle blanche” (“The white room,” 1975) — another of his décors — Broodthaers recreates a room of his apartment and prints words associated with art-making, like “color,” “subjects,” “paper,” “shadow,” and “bright,” on the white walls and floors. The scene conjures the image of an artist in her room, as her thoughts about her art reflect and swim about her. Again, the implication here is that words are at the source of art — a message, in the end, that feels, at least for a viewer today, a little trite. I try once more to gaze over the words — “gallery, “black,” “figure,” “copy” — but I have trouble moving beyond their literal nature. I am, quite frankly, a little bored — they’re like the words AP Art History classes use to describe Western painting. In an effort to get us thinking about art as more than objects, Broodthaers encases it with written language. But his words don’t always feel integrated into the artwork; rather, they speak at the art, to the image referenced. Perhaps, in this sense, he is more like a type of critic. Which brings us back to Flaubert and Berger: Do words and images, like oil and water, not mix? Perhaps it’s the words Broodthaers chose that make his works too literal and obvious, or his curmudgeonly tone that distracts them from their poetry. But, in the end, he probably should’ve stuck with words. Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through May 15. Marcel Broodthaers: Écriture continues at Michael Werner (4 East 77th Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through March 26.",https://hyperallergic.com/278929/marcel-broodthaerss-fraught-relationship-with-words/,,Hyperallergic
59,59,20-06-19 00:00,2019,6,20,Gergely Szakacs,"Hungary has no evidence of Huawei threat, plans rapid 5G rollout: minister","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has no evidence that equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei poses a security threat, a government minister said on Thursday, adding that Budapest was mulling incentives to accelerate the rollout of a high-speed 5G network.  The United States and some of its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies’ equipment could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the European market. Huawei denies the accusations.  Washington is concerned in particular about the expansion of Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of telecoms equipment, in Hungary and Poland.  Budapest has so far shrugged off the security concerns and on Thursday Innovation and Technology Minister Laszlo Palkovics told Reuters that Hungary had yet to receive any evidence beyond what he called accusations leveled at Huawei.  “We have taken a rather pragmatic stance, the same, in fact, as Germany,” Palkovics said. “It has not been proven that Huawei’s technology would pose any risk to Hungary, as we have seen no (data) to support that.”  “Until it is proven that Huawei, or Cisco or any other technology poses any threat to our community, that is Hungary, NATO or the European Union, we will handle Huawei’s technology as any other technology,” he added.   Palkovics’ comments follow the Hungarian telecoms regulator NMHH’s publication this week of the draft documentation for the sale of more than 400 megahertz of 5G spectrum later this year. This fires the starting gun on the rollout of a high-speed wireless network expected to serve self-driving cars and real-time communication between machines.  He said the country expected the auction to raise about 70 billion forints ($244.67 million).   Huawei employs around 2,000 people in Hungary, where it has invested $1.2 billion since 2005 according to company figures. Its European Supply Centre near Budapest, launched in 2009, is Huawei’s biggest production base outside China, the group says.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has strengthened business ties with Beijing over the past years.  Acknowledging that Hungary’s technological acumen lagged that of its U.S. and German allies, Palkovics said Budapest was studying the example of Germany where he said an assessment system was developed to precisely identify possible security threats. Germany is Hungary’s biggest foreign investor.  “I am positive, that if it were to become obvious that (there is a security risk), Hungary is a member of NATO, which entails a spate of commitments, which we will follow, but so far, there has been no information to support that,” he said.  Deutsche Telekom unit Magyar Telekom has installed Huawei and Cisco Systems Inc equipment at a 5G test base in western Hungary.  Asked whether Huawei could participate without restrictions in the rollout of Hungary’s 5G network, Palkovics said:  “Once other, technologically more advanced countries launch the rollout that way, we will follow suit. If they do not, we will not either.”  Palkovics said the government was planning talks with telecoms companies and other players in the sector on ways to facilitate a faster rollout of 5G.  The minister said he had met representatives of Germany’s Siemens and car maker BMW, which plans to build a 1 billion euro factory in eastern Hungary, for talks on possible uses of 5G technology.  “In Germany, Siemens and BMW have proposed that there should be an available spectrum for in-house applications. These companies are also present in Hungary and they have proposed the same,” he said, adding that these frequencies would be allotted in a second stage of the Hungarian 5G tender.

60,60,31-05-16 11:50,2016,5,31,Todd Schneider,"How love and marriage are changing, according to 63,000 New York Times wedding announcements","The New York Times weddings section is renowned for its obsession with status, providing a window into what the world’s most self-important people deem to be important. Sex and the City references the section repeatedly, and many publications have taken to scrutinizing couples’ credentials over the years. In 2013, I built Wedding Crunchers, a search engine for the express purpose of analyzing NYT wedding announcements, and published an exploration of trends across 35 years of what I dubbed ""yuppie nuptials."" Three years after my first effort, if feels like an opportune time to revisit the analysis and take a look at some new trends. The data set now includes more than 63,000 wedding announcements dating back to 1981, and a lot has changed in the weddings section since then. The latest data shows that: Some things remain the same — the omnipresence of the Ivy League, lawyers, and Wall Street, to name a few — but with the preamble out of the way, let’s dive in and see what we can learn. The NYT only recently began including information about how couples met, whether in college, online, at SoulCycle, or by some other method. I extracted this ""how they met"" data from 702 announcements since August 2015 and assigned each announcement to a high-level category. Here’s how the meeting spots of the NYT wedding section break down. Based on 702 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 Schools account for more introductions than any other category, with colleges outnumbering graduate programs by about a 2-to-1 ratio. The somewhat vague ""met via mutual friends"" comes in a close second, followed by online dating and what I labeled ""happenstance,"" which applies to announcements that say something like ""they met at a bar"" or, in one case, at Burning Man. The ""organized activity"" label I created includes couples who met doing things like volunteering for political campaigns, playing in kickball leagues, or attending church. The ""other"" bucket is something of a catchall, including couples who were set up on blind dates, met at other weddings, or were childhood friends. There are clearly some universities that dominate the wedding listings. Of the 188 couples who met at school, 15 met at Harvard, more than any other institution. On the right is the full list of schools that produced more than five couples. Older couples are more likely to have met online or via mutual friends. I also parsed out age data for each individual, so I could make the same ""how they met"" graph for people in their 20s, 30s, and over 40. Based on 702 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 It’s interesting, if not surprising, to see how the frequencies change based on age group. Almost half of 20-somethings in the NYT weddings section met in school, compared with only 2 percent of the 40-plus demographic. As people get older, it’s more likely they met via mutual friends or online. I was curious which dating services were most frequently mentioned, so I took all the couples who met online and split them further by the particular services they used. Based on 87 New York Times wedding announcements published since August 23, 2015 OkCupid leads the pack, having introduced 39 couples, while Match and JDate follow with 16 and nine couples, respectively. Tinder and Hinge have four each, but their numbers might be limited by a selection bias. Phone-based dating apps are relatively new, so it’s nearly impossible that a couple who met online five years ago could have met using a phone-based app (though shout-out to Reverend Dennis Tinder, who officiated this 1988 wedding, cementing his status as the first ""Tinder"" appearance in the weddings section). The ""other"" bucket includes a handful of dating services that appear in one announcement each, and some folks who met online even though they didn’t use a dating service. One recent couple met on Instagram, proving that even in the relatively staid world of the NYT, it can, and does, go down in the DM. While Tinder and Hinge have each introduced four NYT couples, Tinder is winning a subtler competition for notoriety. Whenever Tinder appears in an announcement, it requires no additional description, whereas Hinge is always referred to as ""the dating app Hinge."" The implication is that of course people know what Tinder is, but maybe they’ve never heard of Hinge, much in the same way that Goldman Sachs is consistently described as the investment bank, while less notable companies are often ""an investment bank."" Here are the relevant excerpts: People in the NYT Weddings Section have been getting older over time. Wedding announcements started including ages in 1989, when the median age was 27 for women and 29 for men. As of 2016, the median ages have increased to 30 for women and 32 for men. In 1989 you were twice as likely to see a 20-something in the weddings section as you were a 30-something, but as of 2016 the 30-somethings have taken over the majority, presumably to the chagrin of expectant grandparents throughout the tristate area: Based on 38,274 New York Times wedding announcements published since 1989 Same-sex couples are an exception to this trend: The median age of same-sex couples was 43 in 2011 and has since fallen to 35. But that might be an artifact of the legal process: When New York state recognized same-sex marriage in 2011, there was likely a backlog of older couples who would have been married years earlier had it been been allowed, and these older couples would cause the median age to skew higher shortly after the official recognition. Wedding Crunchers lets you search for words and phrases, then returns a graph that shows you how frequently they appear in weddings announcements. This is called an ""n-gram analysis,"" where the y-axis represents the average number of occurrences per announcement. So for example, if you see a y-axis value of 0.1 for a word, it means that word appears an average of 0.1 times per announcement. NYT wedding announcements lend themselves nicely to n-gram analysis because they’re fairly consistently structured, including data on where people went to school, their job titles, who officiated the ceremony, and more. The special Vows articles are an exception: They are longer and don’t follow the standard announcement structure, so Wedding Crunchers specifically excludes Vows articles from n-gram results. As of May 2016 there are 63,000 wedding announcements in the Wedding Crunchers database. New York is widely known as the financial capital of the United States, if not the world, and it shouldn’t be surprising that a lot of married folks work in the financial industry. In more recent years, the city has grown its presence in the technology sector as well, embodied by Google pulling even with Goldman Sachs in NYT wedding announcement mentions: There are, of course, of more scientific ways to compare NYC’s tech and financial industries beyond cherry-picking wedding announcement mentions for two particular companies. Employment and wage data might be good places to start, but I’d argue that NYT wedding mentions get at something core to New York City's prestige-obsessed culture that would be difficult to quantify with traditional employment data alone. Put another way: I doubt that people explicitly choose jobs by asking themselves, ""What would look best in my future NYT wedding announcement?"" But I’d also suspect that the answer to that question is highly correlated with people’s actual decisions, at least for the people who end up in the weddings section. So although Google and Goldman Sachs are just two companies among many, the fact that Google appears as frequently as the most prestigious investment bank suggests that at least a certain brand of tech company now rivals investment banks for prestige. Startups are on the rise, too, though lest we get ahead of ourselves, they’re still only a tiny blip on the radar compared with law firms and banks, the most traditional of all NYT wedding professional institutions: It seems like everyone is hawking a mobile app these days, and NYT wedded couples are no exception. Instances of ""mobile apps"" and related phrases shot up beginning in 2013, surpassing ""social media,"" which apparently is so first-half-of-the-decade: Trends come and go, and there are plenty of people questioning the near-term outlook for tech companies, but it’s amusing to look back on the proliferation and subsequent retrenchment of ""internet"" mentions circa 2000: Religious diversity is on the rise, but politically the weddings section is bluer than ever. One of the big themes of my previous analysis of the wedding announcements was the increase in ethnic diversity from the 1980s through today. That trend has continued, as encapsulated by more mentions of Hindu ceremonies alongside fewer Episcopalian ceremonies: There’s also a trend toward having friends officiate weddings, as evidenced by mentions of Universal Life ministers and American Marriage Ministries. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a rejection of organized religion by the younger generation, but it does seem like reverends and rabbis have lost a bit of market share in the past decade: Politics is one area where announcements aren’t getting more diverse. Political party names show up in announcements when someone works for a campaign, or is a politician or the child of one. I noted last time around that Republican mentions actually outnumbered Democrat mentions in the early 1980s, but over the past decade the ratio has favored Democrats by a nearly 3-to-1 ratio: At least in the world of NYT weddings, peak Trump occurred in 2006. Upon closer inspection, about a quarter of all ""Trump"" mentions were actually for Donald’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry, who served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and had a handful of clerks whose announcements made the weddings section. The NYT began publishing announcements for gay couples in 2002, some nine years before same-sex marriage was recognized by New York State. Initially, same-sex announcements used euphemistic phrases like ""affirmed their partnership"" and ""commitment ceremony"" instead of the traditional ""married"" language. But over time, and especially now that same-sex marriage is legal in the United States, same-sex announcements began to use the same language as opposite-sex announcements, so we see the euphemisms in decline: Since 2011, when New York state recognized same-sex marriage, same-sex couples account for about 10 percent of all announcements. Interestingly, men outnumber women by about 3 to 1 in same-sex announcements. A 2013 report from the Pew Research Center found that ""female-female marriages outnumbered male-male marriages in every reporting jurisdiction except New York City,"" so at least one plausible explanation for the same-sex gender imbalance in the NYT is that there are more gay men than gay women getting married in NYC. Another area in which men and women are not equal in the NYT weddings section: Latin honors. I’ve seen headlines before about how girls tend to do better in school than boys, and the weddings section supports the claim, as women graduate cum laude more often than men do: The trend holds for magna cum laude mentions as well, though the genders are pretty much equal for summa cum laude graduates. The NYT’s rules for submitting a wedding announcement specify that photos should include couples with ""their eyebrows on the same level and with their heads fairly close together."" Some friends of mine were recently featured in the weddings section despite a rather nonconforming photo, which, believe it or not, came up as a topic of conversation at the morning-after brunch. My contribution to the discussion was a promise to use the Wedding Crunchers database to determine the most conforming photo of all time. I ran every wedding photo through a face detection algorithm to extract coordinates for facial landmarks, then ranked the photos based on how level each couple's eyes and eyebrows were, plus how close together their heads were. Finally, we can all stop wondering: The most perfectly conforming NYT wedding photo of all time belongs to Tyler Davidson and Hilary Burt. Congratulations!

61,61,03-08-17 12:56,2017,8,3,Jason Guerrasio,"'The Dark Tower' movie review: It has no heart, slaughters Stephen King books","There's a creed The Gunslinger lives by in ""The Dark Tower,"" and it ends with: ""You do not kill with your gun. He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. You kill with your heart."" Director Nikolaj Arcel and everyone at Sony should have thought about that meaning more when adapting Stephen King's eight-book series, because unlike The Gunslinger, they had no heart in their attempt to bring this classic to life. Done in a brisk 90 minute running time, the movie feels like a bunch of scenes cobbled together. With a disregard to character development, or even simply giving the audience a moment to breath in the world, the feeling of watching ""The Dark Tower"" is like racing through a meal because you are late to an appointment. At one point, I was imaging what it must have been like to edit this movie. Likely it was days filled with Sony Pictures head Tom Rothman standing over the editor screaming, ""IS IT DONE YET? IS IT DONE YET?? IS IT DONE YET!?!?!?"" The movie opens with teenager Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) having a nightmare that kids are being forced to be weapons for an evil Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) in his quest to destroy the Dark Tower, a giant black structure that goes high up in the sky. Seriously, that's all I know about it. The movie gives very little indication of its importance outside of it being very powerful. Gradually, we learn that Jake continues to have visions of The Man In Black and Roland Deschain/The Gunslinger (Idris Elba), while noticing that people around him seem to be strange creatures disguised as humans. Eventually, Jake's visions lead him to a portal to another dimension, and there he meets The Gunslinger. The two then go out to find the Dark Tower and also face The Man in Black. I never read the King books, but it's more than obvious Arcel and the slew of screenwriters who have taken on this project over the years — there are four credited, including Arcel — completely slaughtered King's material. Numerous supporting characters are given zero time for audiences to understand who they are and their importance in the story. And even more bizarre is the major power Jack has in the movie is actually a reference to another King book. About halfway through the movie, Jack discovers that he shines, which means he has psychic abilities. It's a power Danny Torrance possesses in King's novel, ""The Shining."" Though it's kind of cool that the movie makes a reference to another King classic, it's also very weird. In King's ""The Dark Tower"" books, Jack possess a similar power called ""The Touch."" Wouldn't it have made more sense to go with that? Fans of books like the movies they are based on to reference what's actually in them. It's hard to fault Elba or McConaughey for their performances. Whatever they were sold on to accomplish in this movie likely never panned out. Honestly, outside of some fish-out-of water comedy done by Elba when The Gunslinger transports to Earth briefly, there's nothing memorable about any performance. It's more than obvious Sony wasn't looking to really make a movie for the fans of the books — which is just plain bizarre. They are the ones who can't wait to see this! ""The Dark Tower"" turns out to be just the latest in a long line of movies based on King's books that are nothing like his work. The added problem with this one, however, is it's nowhere near close to being as good a standalone movie as most of those others. ""The Dark Tower"" opens in theaters on Friday.",https://www.businessinsider.com/the-dark-tower-movie-review-2017-8,,Business Insider

This is where you'll see us chat about movies, TV, and even sports, and welcome you to participate in the discussion. I love Christmas music. I know, a lot of it is grating and it’s been effectively weaponized by our Christmas, Inc. consumer culture, a sonic assault sent ahead of the credit card statements to force merriment and “Christmas Spirit” on people—of any and all beliefs—that find themselves in its path. If you’re feeling a bit blue this time of year, or if—like in my family—a lot of losses have attended this time of year, Christmas music can sound at best inappropriate and at worst positively mocking. And yet: starting around Thanksgiving I have an insatiable need to hear Frank Sinatra loving those J-I-N-G-L-E BELLS off an antique piece of vinyl with predictable, well-known scratches. John Denver  and The Muppets? Sign me right the fuck up. I just submit myself to the Boomer cultural hegemony around the holiday season, unironically enjoying Perry Fucking Como’s sentimental Christmas dirges, or Dean Martin sounding genuinely delighted to find himself in a “Marshmallow World”. But my  favorite music to listen to around this time of year is the music the leans all the way into the bittersweet nature of the holidays, and the sharp juxtapositions you get between personal struggle and public celebration. I’m the guy who, on Dec. 24th with the family gathered all around, is putting Low’s  Christmas on the CD player so we can all listen to the Gothic menace of “Long Way Around the Sea”. Or if I  really want to bring the eggnog and gift exchange to complete halt, I like to blast Stan Rogers’ “First Christmas” which always has a couple verses that leave me wrecked. The “non-traditional” song I probably look forward to the most is one of the hardest to find: Marcia Ball and Marian McPartland’s “Christmas Is Just Another Day”, which is just a great, sparse jazz song about feeling like you’re stuck on the outside looking in at rituals of the holidays. I’ve only ever found it on  An NPR Jazz Christmas (which is way better than it sounds). What about you? What are your favorite holiday jams, ironic or unironic?

63,63,19-07-17 16:33,2017,7,19,"Anna  Fitzpatrick, Lia Kantrowitz","Finally, Someone Is Teaching Old People How to Fuck Good"," Porn star Nina Hartley faces the camera, her blond hair swept back in a ponytail, red-framed glasses perched on her nose. She's dressed like a gym teacher in white pants and a red track jacket zipped low enough to suggest she isn't wearing much underneath. She's standing in locker room, surrounded by senior citizens adjusting their retro gym clothes.   ""Contrary to what many of us think, sexual desire doesn't diminish with age,"" Harley says in her gentle lisp. ""In fact, it's one of the last functions people lose in their golden years. That's because today, thanks to advances in medicine, like the pharmaceuticals prescribed for erectile dysfunction, what used to look like this,"" here she holds up a small, browning banana, ""now looks a lot like this."" She holds up a significantly larger, firmer banana, while smiling cheekily at the camera.  Hartley, a 58-year-old veteran performer whose IMdB acting credits include  Anal Annie Just Can't Say No,  Rear Action Girls 2, and  Boogie Nights, has teamed with Pornhub to create  Nina Hartley's Old School: A Complete Guide to Safe Sex After 65. The campaign includes the aforementioned video, made to look like a vintage sex-ed film complete with atonal muzak and a grainy FBI copyright video at the beginning. The video is also available on VHS, and hard copies can be ordered by retirement homes and educational orgs, making the information accessible to tech-averse seniors.Over the course of 15 minutes, Hartley walks her audience through STI prevention and safe-sex practices, before directing them to an accompanying website that illustrates low-impact sex positions. Much of the campaign is wry and tongue and cheek—the cringey promo vid includes an elderly woman getting a ""GILF LIFE"" Ed Hardy–esque tramp stamp while rap music plays—but that doesn't mean it isn't 100 percent sincere. ""It's important that seniors are shown and seen as fully sexual individuals, worthy of privacy, pleasure, safety, and play,"" Hartley tells me over email. She graduated from San Francisco State University's nursing school in 1985, and her videos frequently combine the erotic with the educational regarding matters of sexual health. She first became aware that STIs were on the rise among seniors after reading a newspaper article several years ago but adds, ""It wasn't surprising, as people will always seek out connection, pleasure, intimacy, and good times. Age is no barrier to pleasure.""  ""There is a common misconception that people just stop being sexually active after a certain age, and that simply isn't the case,"" says Corey Price, VP of Pornhub. The adult video–streaming site had previously launched socially conscious initiatives such as awareness campaigns for domestic violence and described video for the visually impaired, but Price had long known he wanted to do something for senior citizens. ""It's so easy to find sex tips for millennials, who are often the core demographic for many of today's publications. But when you try and look for any information regarding the elderly, there just isn't much.""  An increase in life expectancy combined with a lack of risk for pregnancy means that more and more senior citizens are having unprotected sex. ""Between 2007 and 2011, the number of chlamydia infections in people over 65 rose by 31 percent, and syphilis by 52 percent"" says Hartley incredulously in the video to a sheepish looking audience. Infections that are inconvenient to a younger person can be fatal in an already weakened immune system.   ""With the launch of  Old School, we would like to garner more mainstream awareness about the importance of safe sex for today's seniors, particularly those in retirement communities and nursing homes,"" continues Price. The video is already gaining an audience since its launch [on July 17] and seems to be reaching some of the right people. As one comment on the video's Youtube page reads, ""Thank you Pornhub! I'll be careful from now on. I'm 85 and I still get a lot of vagina.""   Old School highlights just how vast the dearth of awareness is when it comes to the sexual practices of elderly people, especially those who require long-term assistant care. Adult children are frequently responsible for making significant life choices on behalf of aging relatives, and nobody wants to think of their sweet great aunt Beatrice getting spanked or eating ass. ""Most long-term care facilities do not have policies on sexual expression,"" says Dr. Melanie Davis, who launched safersex4seniors.org in 2012, a website run by health professionals that provides information on topics such as engaging in sex after prostate cancer, or coming out of the closet later in life. ""Adult children will often say, 'Well if my parent is in bad enough shape to need to be in long-term care, then they certainly cannot be having sex. That's just not appropriate.'"" Davis argues that a person doesn't stop being sexual just because their faculties have changed. It's often up to the daily caregivers, Davis says, to use their judgement about what's best for the patient on a case by case basis. That becomes more difficult when we treat all long-term care residents as asexual beings.  Davis recently spent the last few months field testing a sexuality education curriculum for older adults, which she plans to have available for sale early next year through a program called Our Whole Lives. It's a capstone in a series that starts in kindergarten with topics such as bodies and privacy, and runs through a lifetime of sexual experiences. ""When people think of sex ed, they tend to think of body parts fitting together,"" she says. ""When we talk about really comprehensive sexual education, it's about being in relationships and understanding yourself.""   It's also about learning to live to the extent one can in one's own body. ""One of my best, most enjoyable and fun sexual experiences was with a gentleman fan aged 90,"" Hartley emails me. ""We had the best time. He's only recently deceased, at age 99, but I'll always remember that night."" You can follow Anna Fitzpatrick on Twitter.

Fortnite: Battle Royale is the most popular video game in the world right now, and the game might be going through a big change soon based on what players are seeing. If you play Fortnite: Battle Royale right now, and you look up in the sky there's a good chance you'll see falling meteors. Some believe the meteor will hit one of the game's most popular areas, Tilted Towers. A blog dedicated to Fortnite news and related content pointed out Wednesday that many players have noticed large ""shooting stars"" falling across the sky while playing the game. The ""stars"" were first spotted a few days ago, according to Fortnite Intel, when they were much smaller and often hard to spot, but have been growing rapidly in size and frequency today. Here's what it looks like in the game now: As the ""shooting stars"" get closer and appear to come closer to the ground, more players have been referring to them as meteors. Many have started to speculate about what the meteors could signal for the game, and what the ramifications might be if one actually hits the ground. Within Fortnite, time is measured in ""Battle Royale Seasons,"" which last about three months. The game is in season three, scheduled to end on April 30, leading many to believe that the meteor could drastically change the Fortnite map with a fiery blast — in a similar way that the dinosaurs were wiped out — especially if it were to hit ""Tilted Towers,"" one of the most high-traffic metropolitan areas in the game, where the meteor has been spotted. Videos of the meteors have revealed an Easter-egg sound effect that is triggered by a player pointing directly at it, as demonstrated by Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins, the most-followed Fortnite streamer on Twitch, saying ""IT IS THE END! IT IS COMING!"": Hardcore fans on Reddit and Twitter have even suggested that listening closely to the sound made by the meteor might convey a secret hint from the game developers at the fate of the meteor via Morse code, a theory that Ninja, who is a well-known consultant of the developers, showed interest in by retweeting: We'll know what these meteors mean for sure in the coming days.

65,65,02-04-18 15:46,2018,4,2,"Daniel Stächelin, Tamara Güclü","In Turkey, Music Takes You Where a Travel Visa Can't","A version of this article originally appeared on Noisey Germany.  In Turkey, journalists at magazines critical of the government, like Cumhuriyet, are currently being thrown in prison. Authors are under constant surveillance, and since 2017 the number of academics who've been fired from their jobs in the public sector has risen to over 5,000. Under President Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish government has aggressively rescinded political rights and civil liberties, with media freedom sharply declining after a violent political coup in July 2016. According to Freedom House, Turkey's press freedom status is listed as ""not free,"" and the country's current ""Freedom in the World"" score is 32 out of 100 (zero being the least free, 100 being the most free).  But what's it like to be a musician in Turkey? Noisey spoke with Ozoyo, a DJ and producer in Istanbul, to find out. The 27 year old was born in Turkey, but lived in Germany with his family for eight years during his youth. He's been back in his home country for nearly ten years now, and lives in Istanbul as a musician and student. The music he makes is largely instrumental: Chill beats with hip-hop samples, with a hint of jazz and electronic music throughout this smooth sound. We asked him about the local music scene in Istanbul, what's its like to be an artist in Turkey's political climate, and his plans for the future.   Noisey: How would you describe your sound?   Ozoyo: The music I make is pretty laid-back. When I first started my music project as Ozoyo, I was listening to a lot of jazz. And I grew up with hip-hop. But I’m not someone who just gets stuck within one genre—I’m open to new sounds and enjoy getting experimental. The first two EPs were laid-back, but my next project is definitely going to be a little harder in terms of its sound.   What sort of influences inspire you? Everything I experience, everything I still want to experience, and everything that’s still waiting to cross my path. Might sound philosophical, but that’s the way I feel. I released my EP Wanderlust two years ago. Back then, I just wanted to travel but never had the time. So I decided to produce an EP that tells a story about traveling and the yearning for faraway places. If you take a close look at the track list, you can see what sort of trip I was imagining for myself.  From the protests in Gezi Park in 2013 to the attempted political coup in July 2016, all the way to the current imprisonment of artists and journalists who are critical of the government: The political landscape of Turkey has changed significantly in recent years. What is your impression of the current political climate in the country? The protests didn’t go unnoticed by me. At the Gezi protests in 2013, people initially gathered together to peacefully prevent the trees there from being cut down. Of course there were then groups who acted in a questionable way. But overall, it was about solidarity with a positive underlying idea: the preservation of something old, of the green spaces in the heart of the city in opposition to the construction of another large shopping center. It’s tragic that people wound up dying in the end.  To what degree have the living conditions in Istanbul changed for you?  My life hasn’t changed drastically, but you can see that the prices have risen rapidly. Everything is getting more expensive. The minimum wage is 1,400 Lira (roughly $350 USD) a month, and a beer in a typical bar costs about 15 Lira (close to $4 USD). Of course alcohol isn’t good for your health, but having fun is a privilege for the rich here. Even traveling has become difficult and expensive. First you need to get a passport, then you have to pay to get a visa, and on top of that you have a catastrophic currency exchange rate. For one dollar you’ve got to toss out nearly 4 Lira. That doesn’t leave much room for luxuries like vacation. But luckily, music allows me to travel in a different way. For a majority of the population that just isn’t possible, which is really too bad.  How have the political changes manifested in your daily life?Not a lot has changed in my personal, day-to-day life. I willingly moved back to Turkey with my family in 2008 after having spent eight years in Germany. But since I've come back, I've noticed that a lot of people are trying to move to Germany, England, or Austria. So I’m often asked why I came back [to Turkey]. I'm currently studying linguistics in Istanbul and I'll probably be done with my studies this year. Only once I’m finished with university will I know where I’ll be living.   What do you miss—any not miss—about Germany? What are the perks in your life in Turkey? Döner kebab tastes way better in Germany than in Turkey. That said, I’m not a big fan of the weather in Germany. But I really need to see more cities in Turkey and in Germany. Only then will I be able to form a solid opinion about both countries. I used to live in the Stuttgart region [in southwest Germany], and now I'm in Istanbul. But it’s difficult for me to make generalizations about people. Everyone grows up differently, here and there.   How would you describe the music scene in Istanbul? Like anywhere else, the scene is split up into different genres. Pop music, of course, sells the best. But there are a lot of people who are into less popular music. Thanks to Spotify, musicians here can show the world what they’re capable of. In terms of Istanbul specifically, I’m tight with all the hip-hop people, but also with the electronic community. I also prefer people who aren’t just all about partying, but who have a deep interest in music.  How easy is it to network with others in Istanbul? Just like anywhere else in the world, it’s easy to connect with other people through the internet. Through SoundCloud, Facebook, or Instagram, it’s easy to contact others and make connections that way. There’s a large community for electronic music here, but sadly most of them have gotten stuck in cliché genres like house and techno. That doesn’t mean I don’t like house or techno—on the contrary. I’d just find it better if others would be more open to different styles of electronic music. But still, there are small groups of people that are interested in subgenres of electro and other sounds. So then is there anywhere you’re even be able to perform your music?I’ve been getting booked for shows, yeah. Here in Istanbul I sometimes perform live and play [DJ sets]. Last year I performed in Berlin, Essen, and Munich, and this summer I’ll likely be performing somewhere in Berlin again.  Where do you like to perform the most?  Anywhere there’s music. When I’m in clubs, I play danceable music, from trap to house or techno. Sometimes there are events where I perform jazz or play only instrumental beats. A DJ and producer shouldn’t limit himself to just one genre, but rather be open to all sorts of music and then perform them. Your sound is awfully smooth. You’ve been working with more hip-hop samples recently and they have a pretty chill vibe. What inspired you to do so?Until now, my music has mirrored the quieter side of Istanbul. But my next project will show the darker sides of the city. My next EP is already finished. This time, there won’t just be simple loops, but also entire songs. I look forward to seeing how people respond to it.  Istanbul is a city of extreme contrasts. Not just because it’s split between Asia and Europe, but also because the districts represent contrasting poles—Fatih is very religious, Beyoglu is very open and liberal. How do you experience the contrasts there? Have the different fronts become hardened?  A lot of people came to Istanbul at the end of the 80s to work—people with various backgrounds and sexual orientations. Sometimes living together works quite well, other times not so much. Sometimes a woman will get harassed because she’s wearing a short skirt, and sometimes women who are completely veiled get made fun of by other people. Everywhere you go, people are good and bad at the same time. What keeps you in Turkey? What is it there that makes a difference for you? My studies, my family, and the amazing weather. Besides, you always find up discovering new and amazing little spots in Istanbul.  What projects are you currently working on? Are you collaborating with musicians from other countries?  Because I’ve been living in Istanbul for almost ten years, I can’t just travel anywhere at whim. Before I travel, I have to get a visa, that’s why most collaborations take place via the internet without me having to leave the place where I live. But aside from that, I currently have some collaborations with musicians from Germany and Turkey. I’ll be releasing my new EP in May or June. It’s a mix of trap and lo-fi jazz beats. Other than that, I’m still studying and will get my degree this year. And then hopefully I’ll continue to make music for a long time, travel around the world and get to know new, creative people.

Nehlen actually ran against Ryan once before, in Wisconsin’s last Republican primary in 2016 — and lost 85 percent to 15 percent. But not before receiving praise from President Donald Trump for supporting his presidency. At the time, Trump was facing criticism for his public fight with the Khans, the Muslim family of a Gold Star U.S. soldier killed in the Iraq War. Little self-identifies as a “white advocate” and is running for Senate in California. He’s currently outperforming fellow Republican contenders and has garnered the support of the KKK’s Duke.  Little’s platform includes: The California Republican Party has disavowed Little — They even kicked him out of the GOP convention. “There's no room for that kind of hate speech that that man uses,"" Cynthia Bryant, executive director of the California Republican Party, told the Los Angeles Times. Little’s primary is on June 5, and if he wins, he’ll be facing incumbent Democratic Dianne Feinstein in November. Abarr is all about diversity: In 2014, he tried to recruit black and LGBTQ people to the KKK, and now diversity is part of his platform as a candidate for the Montana state House of Representatives.  But Abarr apologized for all of that — mostly. “I am writing to apologize to the citizens of Montana for promoting bigotry and hate against minorities,” Abarr wrote on his campaign website. “First of all, I would like to say that the whole Montana KKK group was just a hoax promoted by me. I created this hoax to infuse fear in the LGBTQ community and racial minorities in Montana.” Still, Abarr’s campaign website includes a call for European Americans to be declared a protected class.  “There is widespread discrimination and hatred targeted at European Americans. There must be protections for us under the law,” his campaign website read. “Caucations [sic] should be able to publicly proclaim their ethnic identity and heritage in all institutions.” (The site spells caucasians incorrectly twice.)",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qvnv5x/who-are-white-supremacists-or-neo-nazis-running-for-congress,,Vice News

The 35-year-old examiner was run over by the candidate at an examination center during the part of the test focusing on maneuvers, Rybnik police said in a statement on their website.  “A 68-year-old woman, in circumstances which are unknown at the present time, hit the examiner, who unfortunately as a result of his injuries died at the scene,” deputy police commissioner Ryszard Czepczor told news channel TVP Info.  At the time of the accident, the examiner was probably testing another candidate, the police said.  Footage from TVP Info showed the red Toyota Yaris involved in the accident with its front bumper and number plate hanging off as it was loaded on to a truck.  “When we spoke to the woman she was in a state of shock and because of that speaking to her would be quite difficult,” Czepczor said.

68,68,16-02-17 00:00,2017,2,16,Elisa Wouk Almino,"The Only Known Film Footage of Marcel Proust, or Proust Descending a Staircase","In the first footage discovered showing Marcel Proust, he speedily descends a staircase at a wedding. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads  In a recently discovered video showing Marcel Proust at a wedding, he descends a staircase unaccompanied, speedily walking past the slower couples to his right. It is the first footage we ostensibly have of the French writer (who appears at second 36). Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan, a professor of film and literature at Université Laval in Quebec, found the clip in researching the Canadian National Cinema Centre archives. Prior to this seconds-long moving portrait, we only had photographs of Proust, who generally appears slightly reclining, with pensive, heavy eyes, and a finger to his cheek. We could only ponder these images and animate his character with what we already knew of his reclusive, sensitive self. For him, photographs could not channel memory in the way “involuntary memories” could — a term he coined to describe when a sudden encounter in your day, like the taste of a madeleine cookie, causes a moment from your past to rush forth. A photograph, however, is limited by a single frame and is purely visual. At the same time, it gives you the time to linger over it. In The Guermantes Way, the narrator, in contemplating a photograph of the character Mme. de Guermantes, says it “allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory).” It is with swiftness and bewilderment that we observe Proust in this video, wearing a bowler hat and a pearl gray suit — two characteristic elements of his style that helped give way his identity. It is a bit jarring to see him move, almost sprightly, in the elite milieu he wrote about in his seven-volume series, In Search of Lost Time. In fact, he is attending the wedding of Élisabeth de Caraman-Chimay, whose mother was the inspiration for the Duchesse de Guermantes character. In a way, it is only apt that this video of Proust is an attempt, like his novels, to capture a fleeting moment. However, he made a point of distinguishing the two art forms, writing in Time Regained: “Some critics now liked to regard the novel as a sort of procession of things upon the screen of a cinematograph. This comparison is absurd. Nothing is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that the cinematograph presents.” Luc Fraisse, the director of the journal Revue d’études proustiennes that first published the discovery of the video, observed to the Guardian, “It’s moving to say to ourselves that we are the first to see Proust since his contemporaries.” Ninety-five years after the writer’s death, it feels as though we are instead met with a vision of him. Perhaps this is partly because it’s not a moment in time “we have really perceived.” As I watch and re-watch this seemingly banal moment of Proust walking down the stairs come and go, the video becomes as much about what has passed as what lies before my eyes.",https://hyperallergic.com/359198/the-only-known-film-footage-of-marcel-proust-or-proust-descending-a-staircase/,,Hyperallergic

71,71,31-01-17 12:54,2017,1,31,Julia Belluz,Peter Thiel vs. the FDA,"Since the election of Donald Trump, there’s been a lot of discussion in medical circles about bringing a Silicon Valley ethos to drug innovation in America. This idea is embodied in Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal, who has reportedly been helping the president vet a pool of candidates to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Thiel, a libertarian iconoclast, has repeatedly made the case that the FDA gets in the way of drug innovation by making it too difficult for new medicines to get to the market. Some of the FDA candidates he’s identified — including Silicon Valley’s Jim O’Neill and Balaji Srinivasan — have similarly argued that the agency should dump its requirement that drugs be proven effective before reaching the market, and that we’d be better off if the FDA operated more like a “Yelp for drugs.” In other words, bringing the same speedy and disruptive approach to medical regulation that Silicon Valley brought to the taxi and hotel industries, for example, will unlock cures — fast. But Thiel and his pals miss a very important point about developing new drugs: Manipulating biology isn’t the same as manipulating computer code. It’s much, much harder. Speeding up medical innovation will take a lot more than just stripping down the FDA — it’ll take huge leaps forward in our understanding of biochemistry and the body. Health care is also different from taxis and hotels in another key way: Consumers can’t really judge the safety and quality of medical products by themselves. One of the key notions that undergirds the Peter Thiel view of the FDA is that if the agency just got rid of some of the pesky restrictions for drug approval, we’d usher in another golden age in drug development. (Thiel declined our interview request.) To test this idea, I asked a longtime pharmaceutical scientist (and conservative), Derek Lowe, for his views. In his 28 years in the lab, Lowe has seen hundreds of thousands of compounds tested on a huge variety of drug targets, and never, not once, has he brought a drug to market. The reason? “We don’t know how to find drugs that work,” he said. For every 5,000 compounds discovered at this ""preclinical"" phase of drug development, only about five are promising enough to be tried in humans. That’s a success rate of 0.1 percent. Drug innovation comes from painstaking tinkering and a dash of luck. “It’s very tempting for someone who has come out of IT to say, ‘DNA is code, and cells are the hardware; go in and debug it’,” Lowe said. “But this is wrong.” In Silicon Valley, humans have designed the hardware, software, and computer code they’re working with. In medical research, scientists do not have that advantage, Lowe said. “We have 3 billion years of spaghetti-tangled gibberish to deal with. And unless you’ve done [drug development], it’s very hard to get across how hard it is. I don’t know of anything that’s harder.” Biochemistry and cell biology are “like alien nanotechnology,” he added. So the real hurdle researchers face when it comes to finding new drugs for people isn’t overcoming a stringent regulator; it’s grappling with that “alien nanotechnology” in the lab. Thiel has argued that the clinical trials required to prove a drug is effective slow down the development process. In one talk, he said that if we didn’t force drugmakers to prove their products are better than the others already available, we’d have more “slightly worse, but much cheaper” options to pick from. To address this, he and other regulation skeptics typically suggest that the FDA should loosen up, or even get rid of, its efficacy requirement. Let’s step back a bit to explain how the FDA approves drugs, and the three phases of clinical testing they have to pass to get the final green light. In phase one trials, researchers test drugs for safety in a small group of healthy people, and tinker with dosing. In phase two, they test the drug in a larger group of people and make sure it delivers on its promise by monitoring how well it works against the best available therapies or a placebo. In phase three, the drug is tested on an even bigger group (up to 3,000 people), and again, researchers compare how the drug works against other treatments on the market and carefully analyze safety data. If the drug makes it through phase three, the data is submitted to the FDA for approval. Folks in the Thiel camp argue that removing the efficacy requirements — or abolishing phase two and three clinical trials — would give consumers more drug options. And they’re right on that point: If drugmakers only had to prove their drugs were safe, there would certainly be many more products on the market. But would they be good drugs? Consider this. It wasn’t until 1962 that the Food and Drug Administration starting asking drug companies to prove their products were both safe and effective before they hit the market. Until that time, there were some standards related to adulteration and labeling, but otherwise it was mostly a free-for-all. It took the infamous scandal around thalidomide, a morning-sickness medication that caused severe birth defects, to strengthen the FDA ... and incidentally, the FDA’s efficacy standard coincided with the golden age of drug innovation in the 1970s and ’80s. The failure rate for drugs in clinical trials is about 90 percent. That means the vast majority of drugs aren’t safe or effective enough to be used — they don’t do what they were supposed to do. As Yale FDA researcher Joe Ross noted to me, “If there is no demonstration of a benefit, does it matter if we have more options?” And here’s Lowe: “The clinical failure rate is not 90 percent because the FDA are such bastards. The clinical failure rate is that high because most drugs don’t do what we thought they were going to do.” It’s precisely the clinical trial process, with scientists closely measuring efficacy, that helps weed out drugs that don’t work. Unlike hotels or taxi services, which can easily be evaluated by consumers, consumers often can’t judge whether their drugs are helping or hurting them: The effects may not be obvious or appear for a very long time. “It’s not like when you pick up a car and drive it and decide whether you like it or not,” said Hank Greely, director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford. “Knowing whether drugs are safe and work is something far beyond the common knowledge of patients, and is frankly far beyond the knowledge of most physicians.” Greely pointed out that we already have an example of what a much less regulated drug world would look like: “It’s called the nutritional supplement industry. And it’s a travesty.” Supplement makers don't need to demonstrate that their products are effective or even safe before putting them on store shelves — so most supplements are unproven, and problems with quality and adulteration appear to be distressingly common. In the 1980s and ’90s, Congress and the FDA created several programs to speed up the development and approval process for new pharmaceuticals: the orphan drug designation, priority review, fast track, and accelerated approval. These programs were intended to push the most clinically important, innovative drugs — medicines to treat rare, serious, or life-threatening diseases — out to patients more quickly, often on the basis of more limited and less rigorous clinical trial data. “These pathways along with increased funding for FDA drug reviews from user fees enacted first in 1992 were successful,” said Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in an email. “The average total review time, for example, has fallen from 30 months in the 1980s to currently around 8.5 months.” But the more important question is whether expedited FDA pathways increased the number of innovative new therapeutic options for patients — and here the data is far less clear. “Some transformative drugs, like imatinib (Gleevec) for chronic myeloid leukemia, have definitely benefited from speedier FDA pathways,” Kesselheim said. But research continues to show that the majority of drugs that have come onto the market offer little or no improvement over the status quo. For example, several studies have found that since the mid-1990s, about 85 to 90 percent of new drugs that have come onto the market don't offer any clinical advantages for patients compared with existing therapies. More worryingly, the special expedited development and approval pathways have become the rule, rather than the exception. Newer research, led by Kesselheim in the BMJ, looked at a database of all new medicines approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2013 and found that over the past two decades, the proportion of new drugs qualifying for at least one of the FDA's expedited programs has increased by 2.4 percent per year. Kesselheim and his colleagues also concluded that ""this trend is being driven by drugs that are not first in class and thus potentially less innovative."" So there's little evidence that speeding up approval times has helped spur innovation. Some even argue that if you want to bolster medical innovation, you need to look well beyond the FDA. Yale’s Ross says some of the biggest barriers occur in the world of insurance payers. “Medicare essentially pays for almost everything [the] FDA approves. If payers were making more coverage decisions — including reimbursing more effective, safer medications — based on value, that would be a huge incentive to innovate better products,” he says. Before descending on the agency, Silicon Valley types will also need a firmer grasp of the history of medical regulation and why it’s there in the first place. Peter Thiel has said, ""You would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today,” echoing similar statements from some of the potential FDA picks. Yale medical historian Jason Schwartz disagreed: “This assertion is at best ahistorical, if not altogether meaningless.” The famous Salk polio vaccine trial in 1954 involved more than half a million children, “a number that would be unacceptable today,” Schwartz explained. And shortly after the vaccine’s introduction, problems with its production resulted in the Cutter Incident: Vaccines with live polio virus (instead of killed virus) were administered to thousands of American children, sickening 40,000, leaving 200 paralyzed, and killing 10. Over the past half-century, we’ve seen a number of new vaccines come onto the market, including shots to prevent hepatitis B and meningococcal, which were developed without harming children. “It's exactly the production safeguards and ongoing oversight of vaccines and other products by the FDA today — both before and after approval — that keep these kinds of preventable tragedies from happening again,” Schwartz said. Now that we’ve gone through the reasons Silicon Valley types are misguided, let’s talk about the places where they could really shake up the FDA for the better. Alex Tabarrok, over at Marginal Revolution, argues that the FDA needs to better adapt to the new world of personal technologies that can empower patients. As he wrote on his blog: Today almost everyone carries in their pocket the processing power of a 1990s supercomputer. Smartphones equipped with sensors can monitor blood pressure, perform ECGs and even analyze DNA. Other devices being developed or available include contact lens that can track glucose levels and eye pressure, devices for monitoring and analyzing gait in real time and head bands that monitor and even adjust your brain waves. And several of the FDA commissioner candidates would be well positioned to help the agency work through how to safely integrate these technologies into clinical trial research and patient care. “[FDA commissioner candidate] Joseph Gulfo has experience in getting devices through the FDA process, including the remarkable Melafind, a device for spotting melanomas,” Tabarrok said in an email. “Balaji Srinivasan [another FDA candidate] started a genetics testing company so they have experience in this area.” Mark McClellan, an FDA commissioner under George W. Bush, agreed. He told us he’d like to see the FDA enable innovators to use technologies like electronic medical records, mobile phones, and remote sensing to automatically collect medical data from patients or find potential enrollees for clinical trials. “The big opportunity for time savings is not in FDA review time,” McClellan said. “It’s in the entire development process that leads up to the review — how to design clinical trials, how to enroll patients in them.” Drug approvals in cancer therapeutics is another area several observers said could radically be improved. Dr. Vincent DeVita, an oncologist and former head of the National Cancer Institute, wants to see cancer centers initiate and run early-stage clinical trials instead of the status quo (which involves the agency signing off on the trials first, adding time and cost to the process). The FDA also requires researchers to test drugs separately — but a lot of cancer treatments right now involve treating patients with combination therapies — so here, too, the FDA lags the pace of oncologic drug innovation. But he also said, “I think [these issues] are unique to cancer.” Whoever gets appointed, DeVita said he’s not holding his breath for a big shake up. “I went through five FDA commissioners [while working in government], and not one of them had a major impact on drug development,” he says. It’s the midlevel staff at the agency that often wields the most influence, he added. A “Yelp for drugs,” sponsored by the government, is a long way off.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/31/14364090/peter-thiel-fda-trump-silicon-valley-oneill-gulfo-srinivasan-gottlieb,,Vox

Barring a last-minute decision by Russia to destroy a new medium-range missile that NATO says violates the INF, the United States is set to pull out of the accord on Aug. 2, arguing that it needs to develop its own warheads to deter Moscow.  Moscow says it is fully compliant with the INF treaty negotiated by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world’s two biggest nuclear powers.  “We have not seen any signs of a breakthrough,” Stoltenberg told reporters after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, a closed-door forum that allows for dialogue between the two sides’ diplomats and officials.  Stoltenberg said the chances of a resolution were “going down, day by day” but that NATO had not given up on trying to convince Moscow to destroy the SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missile, which it says the treaty ban on land-based missiles with a range of 500 km to 5,500 km (300-3,400 miles).

79,79,11-07-16 15:37,2016,7,11,Tim Casey,MaliVai Washington on Men's Tennis Today and His Historic Wimbledon Run 20 Years Ago,"Welcome to VICE Sports Q&A, where we talk to authors, directors, and other interesting people about interesting sports things. Think of it as a podcast, only with words on a screen instead of noises in your earbuds. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. From 1992 to 1997, MaliVai Washington was a reliable top-40 player on the ATP Tour who was nonetheless overshadowed by other U.S. players such as Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, and Jim Courier. Still, for two weeks in 1996, Washington was the talk of the tennis world. That year, he defeated American Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals after trailing 5-1 in the fifth set and became the first African-American man to advance to the tournament's final since Arthur Ashe became the first black man to win there 21 years earlier. Washington lost his match in straight sets to Richard Krajicek, and persistent knee injuries forced him to retire three years later, at age 30. Regardless, Washington made a mark in a sport that has had few African-American stars, and no black man from the U.S. has made a Grand Slam final since his Wimbledon run two decades ago. Washington, 47, now lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, where he owns a real estate company and helps run the nonprofit MaliVai Washington Kids Foundation, which he founded in 1994. He has been honored for his work off the court with the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award from the ATP Tour in 2009 and the NJTL Founders' Service Award last year from the USTA last year. Washington spoke with VICE Sports on Friday morning about his career, 1996 Wimbledon, the state of American men's tennis today, and more. What do you see in the players now that you didn't see in your time? Do you think the guys you played with could compete with the guys nowadays?  What I see is players who are getting bigger, both on the men's and women's side, in terms of height. It just seems when I was playing, 5-11, 6-feet for the men was a good size. Now you have a lot of women who are 5-11, 6-feet. I think the tallest player on the men's side is 6-11. You have Milos Raonic in the [Wimbledon] semifinal right now, he's probably 6-9-ish. [Editor's note: He's 6-foot-5]. You have a lot more players who are bigger and taller, but they don't seem to be sacrificing their movement around the court. I think I see that in other sports, as well. I think I see it in basketball. I see it football. The players are getting bigger and stronger, but they're still just as agile and as quick and fast. Is that just because of training, the way they're able to train better than before? It seems that with technology and nutrition, everything in tennis is more of a science today than it ever was. What I mean by that is players who are able to track everything they're doing from their training to their nutrition to their heart rate to how much water they're drinking, how they're feeling. They're tracking it very detailed. That carries over into match analysis. There are some players who have access to hundreds and hundreds of matches of different players. It's getting very much like baseball. I feel in baseball, there is a statistic on every single possible thing you can think of. It's not left to chance. In baseball, this is a pitcher's most likely pitch when it's a 2-2 count. In tennis, it's very similar. It's getting to the point where on break point down, this is a player's tendency. A lot of times, you don't know what a player's going to do, but if you have a good idea of what their tendencies are, that can be the small edge that you need to win a match. Back when you were playing, the technology wasn't there like it is today.  When I was playing, the majority of the scouting was sitting in the stands watching your opponent, or my coach watching my opponent. I had a VCR at home and I would record on VHS tapes matches of players and I would analyze that. In this day and age, you can go on the internet and pull up a guy's match and look up at the statistics and look at his first serve percentage and look at his tendencies. You can do that from a computer in your hotel room. Technology has advanced the game, I'll say. Did you feel good going into the 1996 Wimbledon? Did you feel you were playing well and could make a deep run? Ironically, for whatever reason, I never had a lot of success at Wimbledon prior to '96, though I thought my game should play well on grass. I did have success at other tournaments leading into Wimbledon over the years, but never had success at Wimbledon. I can't really say I felt this huge rush of confidence going into '96 Wimbledon, but you take it one match at a time. As I started progressing through the first week, certainly my confidence was growing. When certain players started falling out of the draw, it was going to be an opportunity for someone to break through and get deep into the second week. In the quarterfinals, you played Alex Radulescu and won a five-setter. What do you remember about that match? It was a grueling five-set match and it was against a quality player. It's one of those matches where I think I went in feeling like I should win the match, but three hours in, you find yourself in a dogfight trying to get to your first [Grand Slam] semifinal. And he's trying to get to his first semifinal. I just remember it just being a dogfight out there. When you were trailing 5-1 in the fifth set in the semifinals against Todd Martin, was there any doubt in your mind? Were you getting nervous there? I jokingly say at 5-1 down, I strategically planned it and that's exactly where I wanted him. Jokingly, I say that. You never plan on being down 5-1. When I'm in the semifinals of Wimbledon, at no point are you about to throw in the towel. The only time you throw in the towel is when you have just lost the last point and you're shaking hands. Then you can give up and say, 'OK, I'm done. I lost.' Prior to that, you're in the semifinals of Wimbledon. You're never going to give up. You're never going to stop trying and stop pushing. I mean, this is the semifinals of Wimbledon. This is the pinnacle, one match away from the biggest match of your career. You're not gonna give up just because you're down 5-1. As I've said many times, I'm not sure why it turned around. Certainly Todd got tight and he could feel the nerves because he was also trying to reach his first Wimbledon final. I just kept saying to myself, 'Whatever you do, just make him play. See if he has the guts to finish the match.' That's what I advise all players to do. Just because you're down, you never want to just start giving away points in games and give away the match because that makes it very easy for your opponent. You really want to see if they have the guts and the mental capacity and the nerves to finish out the match. I just kept telling myself, 'Make him play, just make him play. Don't give him anything.' Lo and behold, I just started clawing my way back into the match. At some point there, the crowd started getting a little bit more boisterous and they were wanting to see more tennis and they were witnessing this big comeback. It was a very special moment for me. The match was suspended by rain four times. Once you won that last point, you must have been thrilled. It was a very tiring match, [I was] just very fatigued. With all of the rain delays, you walk off the court and you don't know if you're gonna be off the court for 30 minutes or three hours. You can't really let your guard down. You're trying to relax, but you're also trying to stay loose and you want to stay prepared because there'll be a point where an official will come into the locker room and say, 'Hey, we're walking out in less than ten minutes.' You're trying to stay mentally and physically prepared to go out at anytime. Once that match was over, it was a thrill. It was the greatest win of my career and the greatest moment of my career up to that point. To come out with a victory was phenomenal. It's the moment that I've always cherished. What was it like heading into the final against Krajicek? Was there a lot of attention for being the first African-American to make the final since Arthur Ashe? I think when you're in the semifinals and final of Wimbledon, there is a lot of attention around you when you're on the grounds of Wimbledon. There was a lot of attention when I was walking to the practice court and trying to practice, just a lot of people around. It certainly wasn't something I was used to, to that degree, but that's where I think it's important to have the right people around you. I had my brother [Mashiska] there who was supporting me and helping me the entire tournament and just keeping things in perspective for me. Even though there is a lot more attention and a lot more press and a lot more people and a lot more autograph seekers, really you're there to do one thing, and that's to win a tennis match. That was my focus going into the final, doing everything I could to prepare and win a tennis match. Do you look back and think Krajicek was just the better player in the final? Was there anything you think you could've done differently? On that particular day, he was the better player. I give him credit for going out under the same pressures I had. He played a better match than I did. I'd say it's as simple as that. In moments like that, it comes down to execution on big points and the player who can control their nerves and also play good tennis throughout. Not great tennis, not the best tennis of your life, but success comes down to the player who can play good, quality tennis. I wasn't able to match his quality. Being linked to Arthur Ashe and being the first African-American man to make a Grand Slam final since him, was that special for you? Afterward, it was special, certainly, but during Wimbledon, that wasn't my primary thought. Certainly there were many people in the press who brought up that fact, that I was the first African-American to be in the quarterfinals since Arthur, the semifinals since Arthur, the final since Arthur. It was fact, but I wasn't really thinking about the historical value of what was going on. I was just thinking, 'How do I win a tennis match?' Really, it was up to tennis fans to think about the historical value. Now, after the match and after my career, I can certainly think back and look favorably upon that and say that that was a great accomplishment. I would've liked to have done one better and won Wimbledon. That would've been very, very special, but it wasn't meant to be. Did you know Arthur at all? Was he someone you looked up to? I didn't know him as a friend or didn't know him closely but had the opportunity to speak with him on two different occasions. I really admired him as a person and certainly as a player. I've always said I admired more about what he was able to do off of the tennis court with his notoriety. He, unlike most players, chose to use his platform for social justice or to create awareness for different illnesses or create awareness for social issues around the world, whether it be apartheid or something else. Not very many athletes in the history of any sport have put their name out there on the front line and stood and walked on the front line for causes, especially as vocally as he did. Not everyone can do that. Not everyone feels comfortable doing that. But that's what I admired most about Arthur. Is there a tennis component to your foundation? Our foundation is really a three-part program. It's not an athletic program. It's not a tennis program. It's really a three-part program that consists of tennis, life skills, and education. With those three impacting our students every single week, we've created a program that allows young people to excel. When they're in our programs, they not only excel, but they succeed. Regardless of what their economic situation is at home, regardless of what their family situation is, it allows them to succeed. So much in life, all we want is a chance. So much in life is not given to us, but if we're given the chance to succeed, we can really show what we can do. With our students, if they're given the chance to succeed, which they are, then they can really show us and the world what they can do. It seems like your parents gave you and your siblings that chance [sisters, Micheala and Mashona, and brother, Mashiska, played professional tennis]. Are you grateful for that? First and foremost, I would say that my parents set a great example for us. My parents are still married to this day. Fifty-six years, I think they've been married. They were two college-educated individuals who worked hard day after day after day. That is one thing that they instilled in us. If it's one thing I could say, the overriding thing that they instilled in us was the value of hard work and being willing to put in the time if you want to succeed. If you think about it, if every parent was able to instill that in their kids, the value of hard work and being willing to put in the time to succeed, how much more success would we see in the world today? I'm grateful to them for everything they did for me and my brothers and my sisters, not only for our tennis careers but for setting an example of 'this is how you raise kids', 'this is how you parent your kids', 'this is how you set an example for your kids to follow'. That's what I try to do today with my two kids, who are 13 and 11. When you were growing up, there were a lot of great young American players: Michael Chang, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier. Do you have any memories of playing them in junior tennis?  I played Andre when we were in 12-and-unders in San Diego, California. I played Pete Sampras in 14-and-unders in Shreveport, Louisiana. I played Michael Chang in Dallas, Texas, in 18-and-unders. These were guys I grew up with playing and rooming with, in some cases, in tournaments and at tennis academies. It was kind of interesting because all of them chose to go pro early and forgo college and I chose to go to college [at the University of Michigan for two years]. It was always an inspiration to me, a driving motivation for me when I saw the success that Chang, Agassi and Courier were all having on Tour as professionals knowing that just one, two, three years prior, these were the players I was competing against at tournaments and beating. That was a motivation for me when I was in college. Were you satisfied with the way things turned out in your pro career?  I'm happy with my career. I'm not satisfied with my career. There were things I wanted to accomplish and did not, but I'm happy that I think I took my God-given ability and I didn't squander it. I think I worked my butt off day after day to try to become the best player I could. I reaped the rewards of that. I think there's always part of you that looks back and says, 'What if?' But I try to look at it from both sides of the coin. What if I hadn't gotten injured? Could I have had the career I wanted and achieve some of the things that I wanted to achieve? But the other side of that is, What if I had gotten injured one year into my professional career and I stayed on Tour for two years? I've always been one to appreciate what I was able to achieve. American men's tennis hasn't gone as well since your era. Do you have any thoughts on the reasons for the drought? I don't have a good answer for you. The USTA doesn't have a good answer for you. But this is something that every tennis federation goes through. I'd say for American men's tennis, the heyday was in the 1990s, without question. We're going through a rough patch in American tennis right now if the goal is to produce Grand Slam champions, the last one being Andy Roddick in 2003 [at the US Open]. We have quality players playing at a high level. Sam Querrey just showed that this tournament at Wimbledon [defeating No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic in the third round and advancing to the quarterfinals]. But we haven't been able to produce those Grand Slam champions. I know a lot of time, effort and money is being spent to do that. It just hasn't worked. But every country goes through that at some point. Look at Australia, look at Spain, look at Sweden, they're struggling with the same challenges the USA is struggling with right now. And then go figure, a small country like Serbia has the No. 1 player in the world [in Djokovic]. Sometimes logic doesn't always explain what goes on or can explain it. James Blake had a good career, but it doesn't seem like tennis has caught on in the African-American community. Why did you think that is? Does more outreach need to be done?  I think part of it comes down to a numbers game. The overwhelming number of African-American athletes here in the United States gravitate towards football and basketball. Millions of young black boys gravitate towards basketball and football. Consequently, where do most black athletes excel? Basketball and football. Look at any NFL team or any NBA team, that's where they excel. If here in the United States we had hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young black boys and girls gravitating towards tennis, let's say, or gravitating towards golf, guess what? You would see more success at every level of junior, college and pro in those sports.. I don't know what would change those numbers dramatically because I think basketball and football will always be very popular sports. I don't know what's gonna change the trend. I hope the sport continues to get more and more players of all races – black, Hispanic, Asian, white players. I hope it continues to get a more and more diverse group of American players that succeed. But even when you do that, there's no guarantee you're going to get players that are going to go win Grand Slams. One of the toughest things in the world to do is go win a major. Just because you have a lot of players playing doesn't mean it's going to happen. I think it'll happen eventually, but I don't know if you're gonna have an American man win a major next year or ten years from now. I just don't know. And then you see someone like Serena Williams winning more than 20. Are you amazed at how the Williams sisters have been able to do so well in the last 15-20 years? I'm proud of what they've been able to accomplish, and I'm amazed at it. What they've been able to accomplish, regardless of their race—just take their race out of it. What they've been able to accomplish as two sisters is absolutely phenomenal. Certainly people acknowledge it, but I don't know if anyone truly has written about or given them the credit for the success that that one family has. I'm thinking of sports, and I'm going back 50 years, and I can only think of a couple of family members that have had this type of success. In baseball, you had the Bonds, Barry and his dad [Bobby]. I'm sure there's a few more that are skipping my mind that I can't think of right now. In basketball right now, Klay Thompson with the Golden State Warriors, his brother [Trayce] plays for the Dodgers. These are two Hall of Famers, Venus and Serena. Serena looks like she might finish her career being the best ever and Venus is gonna finish her career being one of the best ever. And to think that comes out of one family, that's not something that is gonna happen for the next 100 years. It's never happened before. I don't know what would make you think it's gonna happen in the next generation or two. That's how special and rare and unique and fascinating their accomplishments are. Do you coach or play tennis anymore? I still play tennis. I do not coach tennis. I don't have a desire to be out on the court hours a day teaching tennis or even getting out on the road for weeks and weeks a year coaching a player. That's not where I think my skills are or my interest level is. Do you compete in any tournaments anymore or just play for fun? It's probably been a good four or five years since I've played any [senior tournaments]. Once I retired, I never had a big desire to go out and compete at the senior level or compete at senior Wimbledon. For whatever reason, that wasn't a big interest of mine.

81,81,26-08-16 00:00,2016,8,26,Matt Stromberg,The Second Coming of Betty Tompkins,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LOS ANGELES — Sweetie. Pushy Broad. Sheela Na Gig. Queen. Sapphic Poon Hustler. These are just a few of the thousand or so terms used to describe women featured in Betty Tompkins’s sprawling painting installation, WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories, on view at Gavlak Gallery in Hollywood — her first solo show on the West Coast. Along three walls of the gallery’s back room, 1,000 canvases of various sizes from tiny to medium are arranged in a carefully arranged — if seemingly random — pattern. Onto each one, in a neutral, sans serif, all-caps font, Tompkins has painted a word or phrase that describes a woman, from the degrading to the reverential. These thousand terms come from a larger list of 3,500 submissions that she received in response to two requests sent to her entire email list — the first in 2002 and a second in 2013. The four most common words were the same each time: “bitch,” “slut,” “cunt,” and “mother.” And these are from people in the supposedly progressive art world, not your usual internet trolls. The project has been shown in Greece, Berlin, and recently at New York’s Flag Art Foundation, where participants were invited to read the words aloud, letting them contribute their own interpretations and adding a performative aspect. The 70-year-old painter is currently enjoying something of a second act, after emerging from decades of semi-obscurity in 2002 with an exhibition of her Fuck painting series at the Mitchell Algus Gallery in New York. Between 1969 and 1974, Tompkins painted blown-up and cropped monochrome images sourced from pornography, coolly rendered with an airbrush. When I sat down with Tompkins last month, shortly before the opening of her Gavlak show — where more recent examples of these works are also on view — she explained to me that their origin was her extreme boredom with just about everything she was seeing in New York galleries. “I couldn’t stand to look at them. I go, ‘Jesus Christ, you just went through this gallery building in under a half an hour, and these guys must have spent two years doing these paintings.’ I couldn’t make myself stay,” she says. Her husband at the time, artist Don Tompkins, had a collection of pornography that he had ordered from Asia, skirting US obscenity laws by having the material mailed to a post office box in Canada, and then crossing the border to retrieve it. “I was looking at them one day and thinking, you know, if you take off the head, and the hands, and the feet, all the identifiers, then what you have left is something really beautiful in an abstract way, plus it has this tremendous kick as subject matter,” she told Susan Silas in a 2012 interview. “So that’s why I decided to do it.” Tompkins had already switched to a mechanical method of paint application in graduate school, in an attempt to strip away from her work everything that she was comfortable with, was good at, or enjoyed. “I had really loved working with a brush. I loved the bounce off the canvas, such a physical pleasure to me,” she told me. “So I had to give up the brush, and I picked up spray guns.” The Fuck paintings are striking and unapologetic, turning the male gaze on its head, as if asking the viewer, “Is this what you want to see?” Tompkins took lustful images that were then solely meant for men’s eyes and democratized them, rendering them dispassionately, and transforming them for her own ends. Begun at the end of the ’60s, they both reflect and prefigure much of the contemporary art movements of the time, from Pop to Seriality, from Feminist Art to the Pictures Generation. Writing for Flash Art last year, William J. Simmons opined, “ … Tompkins deserves to be positioned as both a pioneer of sexually progressive work, but also of formally replete engagements with appropriation, photorealism, and abstraction.” The reaction to the work at the time was less than encouraging, however, met with either indifference or hostility. “All the dealers said, ‘Come back in 10 years when you’ve found you voice.’ About half would look at me and say, ‘Don’t come back then either; we don’t show women,’” she says. Tompkins had experienced similar sexism as a student when a professor remarked, “honey, the only way you’re going to make it in New York is on your back.” She pleaded with her husband to submit slides of her work to galleries as his own, with simply the name “B. Tompkins” written on them, but he refused, fearing for his university teaching job. Despite being rejected and ignored, or perhaps because of it, Tompkins did not feel a sense of failure. “Nobody had any expectations for me. I had no expectations outside of what I do. So that, in fact, is very liberating.” Commercial success was elusive, although she did make it into a 1975 show at the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston curated by a then fledgling curator named Paul Schimmel — now a partner in LA powerhouse art space Hauser, Wirth & Schimmel — who had been a student of Tompkins’s when he was in high school. “That was crazy because I had never shown anywhere, and then there I was in this museum exhibit,” she recalled. The feminist component of these works is now widely appreciated, but at the time, other artists who considered themselves feminists did not look kindly on her appropriation of pornography. “They had never been welcoming to me,” she recalled. “It was before the internet and email. People were calling each other up, but I was never invited to a meeting.” She sent her work to Paris in 1973 for a gallery show, but it was seized at French customs on obscenity grounds. (Ironic coming from the country that birthed Courbet’s “The Origin of the World.”) It took a year for her to get the paintings back. “They kept being rejected on both sides,” Tompkins said. “It gave me this image that my paintings would go back and forth over the Atlantic Ocean for eternity, while I was never going anywhere!” Tompkins carefully unstretched and rolled up her Fuck paintings, storing them in her apartment for decades until showing them again in the early 2000s. Language started creeping into her work after this episode, with “Censored” drawings, explicit images over which Tompkins laid a grid, stamping “censored” on the offending areas. “I censored my own pieces. I felt I could do it better than anyone,” Tompkins told me. “It was in reality a way to stay sane. Being censored is a really nasty business.” In her next series, text took over the works completely. “I got really interested just in language from reading reviews of first wave conceptual work, which I in no way understood. The critical language frustrated me so much that I would regularly throw my Artforums against the wall,” she said. “Critics were saying, ‘I read this work as …, ’  so I took one of my cow photos and I drew a grid and wrote the word ‘cow’ in each square.” WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories takes this very orderly approach to language and explodes it all over the walls with a vibrant energy. The backgrounds of these canvases are painted in a range of styles, often parodying prominent male painters. “One of the advantages with this series is that I can do anything I want with the paint. I felt really free,” Tompkins told me. “I started studying some of the old boys, de Kooning and the [Abstract Expressionist] group. We’re raised to think of these guys as tortured souls, but my feeling is they were having a lot of fun.” On the surface, this new series may seem very different from her work of almost 50 years ago that roused so much scorn. But for Tompkins, they share a through line that has connected her work through periods of obscurity and recognition. “I like things that are out in the world already. One of the things that I was attracted to in using porn as a source was that it already existed,” she said. ”This language was already out in the world. It was kind enough that people sent it to me, so that I could put it back in the world in a different format, but none of these worlds are mine. They were gifts to me.” Betty Tompkins: Sex Works / WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories continues at Gavlak Gallery (1034 N. Highland Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles) until September 3.",https://hyperallergic.com/319465/the-second-coming-of-betty-tompkins/,,Hyperallergic
82,82,21-01-18 18:46,2018,1,21,Peter Kafka,NFL playoffs: How to live stream the championship games today ,"There are two NFL games left before the Super Bowl: The New England Patriots play the Jacksonville Jaguars today at 3:05 pm ET, on CBS, and then the Philadelphia Eagles play the Minnesota Vikings at 6:40 pm, on Fox. It’s easy to watch the games: Turn on your TV and there they are. You don’t even need a pay TV subscription to watch CBS or Fox (though you may need an antenna). You can also stream the games pretty easily. There are a couple free, legal options, and several more if you want to pay. FREE STREAMS: PAID STREAMS: If you are already paying for TV — either via a traditional cable/satellite company or a new internet streaming service — you can probably stream the games. One thing we would not advise doing is walking around Philadelphia, because you may be splattered with Crisco or worse: Good morning from Philly where crews from the city are greasing the light poles with Crisco to prevent #Eagles fans from climbing after the #NFCChampionshipGame tonight. #Vikings pregame coverage starts at 3 on FOX9.

83,83,03-01-19 00:00,2019,1,3,,"Iran rejects U.S. warning against space launches, ballistic missiles","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif rejected a U.S. warning against carrying out space vehicle launches and missile tests, saying on Thursday they did not violate a U.N. resolution.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran earlier on Thursday against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N.

The telecoms firm aims to offer high-speed internet to tens of thousands of homes and offices in key urban centers as part of its $1.2 billion capital spending this year, Alberto de Larrazabal, Globe’s chief commercial officer, told reporters.  Globe would use Huawei’s equipment like radios and modems to deliver 5G quality broadband internet, he added. Huawei and Finland’s Nokia were Globe’s equipment providers for its 4G service.  The United States had warned that next-generation 5G equipment, which some telecoms experts see as more vulnerable to attack than previous technology, could be exploited by the Chinese government for spying if supplied by Huawei, which the company denies.  Washington, a treaty ally of Manila, had persuaded governments and telecoms operators to shun Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment.  Globe hired independent firms “to ensure that our security protocols are up to date, to make sure privacy and security issues are addressed,” de Larrazabal said.  Philippine consumers, the world’s top social media users, often get frustrated with slow and choppy internet connections. The Philippines’ mobile internet and fixed broadband speeds lag behind its neighbors, data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index showed.  It ranks 107th among 178 countries in terms of fixed broadband speed at 19.55 megabits per second (Mbps) versus the global average of 59.6 Mbps. Among 140 countries, it ranks 107th in terms of mobile internet speed at 15.10 Mbps, nearly half of the 27.22 Mbps global average.  Globe is owned by Philippine conglomerate Ayala Corp, with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd holding a minority stake.

85,85,08-01-16 00:00,2016,1,8,Matt Smith,Oil-Rich Oklahoma Has Been  Hit by Nearly Three Dozen Earthquakes Since Wednesday,"Nearly three dozen small to mid-sized earthquakes have rocked northern Oklahoma towns since Wednesday, rattling windows and nerves in a region where scientists have linked seismic activity to oil wells. The quakes included a magnitude 4.4 and a magnitude 4.8 that struck about two miles apart and within a minute of each other Wednesday night, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported. They kept going into Friday, with two 4.0s on Thursday and a 4.1 on Friday morning. At least 15 more were in the 3 range — and all were centered within a few miles of each other, in a patch of prairie about 100 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, according to the USGS. Wednesday night's quakes were the first ""that really made me nervous,"" said Paul Southwick, the city manager of Fairview, Oklahoma, about 20 miles southeast of the quakes' epicenters. ""It started out with a rumble and then it got louder and louder and louder,"" Southwick said. ""Then I felt this wave go under the house. The house lifted and went down and started shaking. I could feel it with my feet on the floor until it was just about gone, and then we got hit with another one."" 'It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area.' Nearly three dozen small to mid-sized earthquakes have rocked northern Oklahoma towns since Wednesday, rattling windows and nerves in a region where scientists have linked seismic activity to oil wells.

'It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area.' More than 25 people reported feeling Wednesday night's quakes as far away as Kansas City, Missouri, nearly 350 miles away, according the USGS. Before Wednesday night, there had been four or five noticeable recent quakes in the area, Woods County Sheriff's Deputy William Barnum said. ""We've had quite a few of them lately. This one just shook a little longer,"" said Barnum, who lives in Waynoka, about 20 miles west of where the quake cluster was centered. ""In my house, it shook my chair and shook the windows."" In less than a decade, Oklahoma has gone from having one or two small earthquakes a year to nearly three a day. The Sooner State saw more than 900 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or above in 2015, with 29 of them in the 4-range, said Jeremy Boak, the head of the Oklahoma Geological Survey. ""It's the first time we've seen three magnitude 4s in less than 24 hours, and all three in the same area,"" Boak said. ""And those come on the heels of two that were only two days apart."" Scientists say the seismic surge stems from the salty wastewater that gets pumped up from oil wells in the petroleum-rich state, separated from crude oil, and shot back deep underground, where it lubricates the faults that crisscross the state. There are no injection wells operating in the immediate vicinity of the Fairview-area quakes, said Matt Skinner, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the oil industry — but go about 30 miles further out, and there are a lot of them. ""That region has seen an enormous increase in disposal activity over the past couple of years,"" Skinner said. And most of those wells handle high volumes of wastewater, he said. Related: Welcome to Quakelahoma State officials have responded to previous quake swarms by ordering wastewater injection wells in nearby areas to reduce their depth or volumes — most recently around the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, which was hit with a magnitude 4.2 quake on January 1. Skinner said some action would be taken in response to the latest quakes, but officials are still studying what to do. Boak said state seismologists put Wednesday night's biggest quake at 4.6 instead of the 4.8 that the USGS recorded. But he said seismic activity in the area has grown sharply as more oil companies have begun drilling there. ""That's on the edge of an area that has been slowly but steadily lighting up more and more over a larger and larger area,"" Boak said. ""I'm presuming that's partly about the development of this particular play out there."" The oil and gas industry is the bedrock of Oklahoma's economy, and the industry has argued that there's not enough evidence to blame the quakes on injection wells. But even the petro-friendly state government has said it considers the issue settled, even if industry critics say their recognition came too late. Even small quakes have been adding up to big bills for some homeowners, most of whom don't have earthquake insurance. And for others, the quakes are starting to give them the creeps. ""We've felt some others, but again, not to this intensity,"" Southwick said. ""This was to that level that really wakes you up and you say, 'What are we getting into here? Are we going to have something that's going to be worse?' This is concerning.""  Related: A Big Earthquake Just Hit Oklahoma — And It Might Be the Oil Industry's Fault Follow Matt Smith on Twitter: @mattsmithatl",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3kwp3j/oil-rich-oklahoma-has-been-hit-by-nearly-three-dozen-earthquakes-since-wednesday,,Vice News
86,86,18-01-19 00:00,2019,1,18,Katharine Jackson,Trump tells anti-abortion marchers he will support them,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke in a prerecorded video to thousands of anti-abortion activists in Washington on Friday for the 46th March for Life, vowing to veto any legislation that “weakens the protection of human life.”  The event is the largest annual gathering in the United States of opponents of the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. That ruling found that certain state laws outlawing abortion were an unconstitutional violation of a woman’s right to privacy, effectively legalizing abortion nationwide.  “I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life,” Trump said in remarks recorded in the Oval Office, a right he said extended to “unborn children.”   Vice President Mike Pence appeared onstage at the rally to introduce the video, calling Trump, who before entering politics said he supported abortion access, “the most pro-life president in American history.”   During his 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices he believed would overturn Roe. He has since appointed two justices to the court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, cementing the court’s 6-3 conservative majority.  Since the heated Senate confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh, the court has steered clear of some cases on volatile social issues, including abortion.  Marchers trudged through muddy slush on the National Mall holding signs saying “Pray to End Abortion,” “My unexpected pregnancy is now 30!” and calling for the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood, a national healthcare provider that offers abortions as well as birth control and cancer screenings.  One marcher said she had had an abortion at the age of 17 but had been opposed to abortion ever since she became religious.  “No matter how you look at it, it’s taking a life and it’s wrong,” said Marcy Blunier, a 57-year-old real estate broker from New Mexico.  A circle of women bowed their heads in prayer as they waited to start the march down Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court. Two men navigated the crowd hauling a large wooden cross.   Supporters of abortion access say bans infringe on women’s rights and health, and lead to greater rates of injury and death among pregnant women.  About half of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last year, with about 68 percent of Democrats supporting abortion access compared with about 31 percent of Republicans.  The anti-abortion march comes a day before thousands of women descend on Washington for their third march opposing Trump’s presidency.

87,87,25-06-19 00:00,2019,6,25,Laurie Goering,"Despite climate pledges, G20 coal subsidies rise","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Despite promising a decade ago to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, the world’s leading economies more than doubled subsidies to coal-fired power plants over three years, putting climate goals at risk, energy researchers said Tuesday.  Between 2014 and 2017, G20 governments more than halved direct support for coal mining, from $22 billion to about $10 billion on average each year, according to a report by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a think tank.  But over the same period they boosted backing for coal-fired power plants - particularly supporting construction of the plants in other, often poorer nations - from $17 billion to $47 billion a year, the report noted.  China and Japan - which will host a G20 summit later this week in Osaka - were the biggest providers of public finance for coal-fired power, followed by South Korea and India, it said.   While spending from national budgets on coal fell, as did tax breaks for it, other forms of support - from development finance institutions, export-credit agencies and state-owned enterprises - soared, the report said.  “You can see they’re pretty much exporting the dirty energy systems to countries in much earlier stages of their development,” said Ipek Gencsu, a researcher at ODI and a lead author of the report.  Those include nations such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam, she said, where foreign backing for coal power is slowing adoption of cleaner renewable energy systems and locking in dirty energy and air pollution risks.  To meet an internationally agreed goal of holding rising global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, coal power will need to be phased out between 2030 and 2050, according to the Powering Past Coal Alliance.  That alliance, formed in 2017 and led by the British and Canadian governments, includes 30 countries as well as businesses and other organizations committed to switching to clean energy as rapidly as possible to meet climate goals.  Coal currently provides about 40 percent of the world’s electricity, according to the alliance.  Because new coal-fired power plants have a life of about 40 years, over which their costs must be paid back to investors, building new coal plants could lock countries into using them beyond the needed phase-out of coal, energy experts say.  “They’re heading toward a car crash,” Gencsu predicted, with taxpayers in countries that accept new coal plants likely to foot the bill for bailing out investors if the plants are shut early to meet climate goals.  About $3 billion a year in support by G20 governments for coal aims to ease the pain at home of the transition away from the fuel, through measures such as helping workers retrain or rehabilitating closed coal mine sites, according to the ODI report.  But governments are also helping support coal companies that are no longer financially viable, often to ensure a stable baseline of power to complement fluctuating renewable energies such as wind and solar, Gencsu said.  Coal subsidies also continue in many places because of powerful coal lobbies - or because politicians prefer to delay decisions that could have political consequences, she said.  Ilan Kelman, a researcher on sustainability and energy issues at University College London, said that “the people who receive the subsidies may have a lot of influence on the politicians who give them the subsidies”.  Also, quickly slashing subsidies without easing the burden on people’s budgets can lead to political unrest, as France found out last year when it raised fuel taxes, spurring the “yellow vest” protest movement, Kelman said.  Globally, direct fossil fuel subsidies were $427 billion last year, according to the International Energy Agency.  Indirect fossil fuel subsidies  - including things like costs to health systems from air pollution and fossil fuel spill cleanups - were estimated at $5.2 trillion a year in 2017, according to an International Monetary Fund working report.  Gencsu said that to hold the line on climate change, governments, development banks and other bodies supporting coal “need to be much braver and come to grips with the reality of the climate emergency - and make policy decisions very soon.”  Reporting by Laurie Goering ; editing by Zoe Tabary: Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

That was by design.  Leading liberal politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been slammed for conflating migrant detention centers with concentration camps, but a growing number of American Jews like Regunberg are pushing back with a message of their own: Yes, they're concentration camps, and we must stop them now. Invoking the Holocaust, they have been protesting outside ICE detention centers across the country, chanting ""Never Again for Anyone."" “Never Again isn’t just about remembering how the Holocaust ended. It’s also about how it started, with a gradual process of legal exclusion and state-sponsored dehumanization that led eventually to the deaths of my grandpa’s family and so many millions of others,” Rugenberg, whose relatives were murdered in the Holocaust, said at the protests in Providence last week. In the last two weeks alone, thousands of Jews, young and old, have turned up outside ICE facilities in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities chanting “Never Again Means Now” and “Close the Camps.” As of this writing, more than 120 have been arrested. If the movement has its way, they’ll soon be joined by hundreds more.

""As mostly white or white-passing Jews, we feel obligated to make heightened risk the baseline of what we are doing,” Sophie Ellman-Golan, one of the organizers of Never Again Action, told VICE News. The movement was inspired by a Facebook post by Serena Adlerstein, a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who works with Movimiento Cosecha, an organization led by and for undocumented immigrants. Adlerstein posed the question, “What would I have done if I were alive during the Holocaust?”  “Most Jews are conscious to the experience of refugees and immigrants. It’s so recent in our history. It’s clear which side our community should be on.” The response turned into the first action on June 30, when over 100 Jewish protesters gathered in front of an ICE detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and tried to block employees from entering. Eventually 36 were arrested and charged with obstructing public passage. The next day, 2,000 American Jews expressed interest online in taking similar actions in their city. Then on July 2, 1,000 Jews in Boston and a few hundred in Providence did similar location-specific anti-ICE actions, with 18 arrested in each place. More protests followed on July 4 in Philadelphia, resulting in 33 arrests. On July 5, nearly 500 protested outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office building in San Francisco with the message “Close the camps or we will close your office.” Demonstrations continued this week in Chicago, D.C. and Buffalo, New York.  “Most Jews are conscious to the experience of refugees and immigrants. It’s so recent in our history. It’s clear which side our community should be on,” said Alyssa Rubin, one of the organizers, who is also active with IfNotNow, a network of Jewish activists calling for an end to U.S. support for Israeli occupation. “It’s important to show up as Jews because, with our connection to the Holocaust, we have a stake and a moral authority.”  This willingness to draw direct parallels to the Holocaust has become a central tenet of the movement. While prominent American Jewish institutions like the Anti-Defamation League, The Jewish Community Relations Council and the American Jewish Committee rejected Ocasio-Cortez’s use of the term “concentration camps,” Never Again Action has embraced it.  They’re drawing headlines and national attention because of it.  “The Jewish community definitely has the ability to pull the heartstrings of people, and we’re seeing a shift of public opinion,” said Catalina Santiago, 22, a community organizer with Movimiento Cosecha, who was at the protest in Boston. She says there has never been a partnership on this scale before. “It’s been really powerful for Never Again Action to verbalize solidarity with communities being terrorized every day. They are popularizing the outrage on this issue and the demand for protection of immigrants.” Read: These Photos Show What It’s Like at Overcrowded Border Patrol Stations The movement’s GoFundMe page has already raised $180,000 in 10 days to pay for legal fees, with leftover money going to Cosecha, which has been protesting ICE since the Obama era. Meanwhile, their acts of civil disobedience at key ICE facilities across the country is helping keep outrage over the issue front and center, applying pressure on leading centrist Democrats to speak out. This week, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called on the Trump administration to ""clean house"" at Customs and Border Protection. ""The top people at CBP ought to be fired,"" he said.  “The Jewish community definitely has the ability to pull the heartstrings of people, and we’re seeing a shift of public opinion.”  Never Again Action may already mark the most significant wave of American Jewish activism in decades, said James Loeffler, professor of modern Jewish history at the University of Virginia. “Since World War II American Jews have taken to the streets in large numbers twice: once to fight for civil rights and once to free Soviet Jews,” Loeffler says. “The first we did as Americans who happened to be Jewish, the second as Jews who happened to be American. Now, we are seeing activists who seek to emphasize their braided identity as both Jews and Americans,” he said. The movement’s sudden rise to national prominence is impressive, but it didn’t happen in a vacuum.  Jewish outrage has been steadily growing since Trump took office in 2017. Jews have watched as Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists,” described African and Caribbean nations as “shithole” countries, said there were “very fine people on both sides” after neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville chanting “Jews will not replace us,” and directly targeted Muslims and refugees with hostile rhetoric. They’ve worried over the staggering rise of white nationalist speech and explicitly anti-Semitic hate crimes. And they’ve shown up to protests: at airports in the early aftermath of Trump’s Muslim Ban, at the national mall during the Women’s March, and in Pittsburgh, after the massacre of 11 Jews in in the Tree of Life Synagogue in October.  Read: U.N. Human Rights Chief “Appalled” by Conditions of Child Detention at U.S. Border But all of this seems to have crystallized into this current moment, provoking wide swaths of mostly young Jews to not just join actions but also lead them.  “We are seeing an overlap of anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic rhetoric,” said Ellman-Golan, one of the organizers. “We have seen how the [George] Soros conspiracy theory targeting thousands of immigrants has led to Jews being murdered. There is deep outrage.”  Nearly every day, people are turning out to protest in their cities, big and small, with actions planned this weekend in Michigan and New Hampshire. Organizers are planning a large action in D.C. on Tuesday, July 16. The pressing questions now are: Where are these protests headed and will they create broader action outside left-leaning Jewish circles? Thus far, aside from J Street, most major American Jewish organizations that normally influence Washington’s position on these issues have been noticeably quiet. While resolutely condemning conditions at the border and calling for an end to detention of asylum-seekers, immigration is not a core issue for them, and they do not appear to be taking institutional action. (The AJC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The ADL, meanwhile, said that they “don’t have much to say about these actions.”) “There is deep outrage”  Rubin, from Never Again Action, said the Jewish mainstream condemned Ocasio-Cortez’s comments almost more forcefully than the detention centers themselves.  “If they truly felt these camps are concentration camps, they might put a little more institutional force behind pressuring Congress to do something more drastic,” she said.  Their inaction, however, has opened the door for other parts of the Jewish community to take the lead. “I think they’ve ceded the mic to us,” she added.

91,91,25-02-16 12:30,2016,2,25,Matthew Yglesias,Why Obama is vetting Nevada's Republican governor for the Supreme Court,"Brian Sandoval, the moderate Republican governor of Nevada who also happens to have been a federal judge before becoming governor, has been floated by both of his home state's senators as a possible compromise Supreme Court appointment. The White House is apparently taking the idea seriously enough to have commenced some formal vetting to see if there's some big reason other than the obvious partisan politics angles not to do this. But then there are the obvious partisan political angles. If literally everything about American politics in 2016 were different, filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of an iconic conservative justice with a moderate Republican could be a sensible compromise between a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate. But in the actual politics of 2016 it seems so obviously doomed as to be hardly worth trying — though floating Sandoval's name in the press as a way to bait Republicans into batting it down could be a savvy strategy for Democrats to underscore exactly how rigid the GOP is being about the confirmation battle. More importantly, while Sandoval does not seem like the right person for the current situation, the situation will almost certainly change and Democrats on Capitol Hill, though well-aware that the base doesn't like the idea, tell me it's a possibility that should be taken seriously. If, for example, Hillary Clinton wins in November but Republicans maintain control of the Senate the Sandoval Option could start to look like a timely solution. The Nevada governor is a Republican and, as such, a generally reliable conservative on a range of issues. But as the governor of a politically moderate state that had a Democratic controlled legislature for parts of his tenure, he has taken a number of noteworthy moderate positions: Sandoval also has an interesting long-term relationship with frenemy Harry Reid, the Democrats' leader in the Senate. Way back in 2004 when Sandoval was attorney general, Reid recommended him to the Bush administration as a Republican he would gladly back for a seat on the federal judiciary. Sandoval got the nod from Bush for a seat on a federal district court, and the affair was generally interpreted in the press as an example of Reid's political savvy — by putting the young, popular Sandoval on the federal bench he eliminated him as a potential Reid opponent in his 2004 reelection battle. But then in 2009, Sandoval resigned his seat on the bench to run for statewide office. Not against Reid (who ended up narrowly defeating weak opponent Sharron Angle) but against Reid's son, Rory, chair of Clark County's county commission. Notwithstanding the family drama, Reid and Sandoval have often been allies on Nevada-specific issues, fighting against nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain and for the construction of Tesla's Gigafactory battery manufacturing facilities. As a politician who is also a former federal judge, Sandoval is more qualified for a Supreme Court seat than the typical elected official who gets floated. And as a moderate Republican, he is ideologically positioned between Barack Obama and the GOP Senate leadership, which seems like the kind of thing you would want from a compromise candidate. What's more, in a practical sense whether or not Obama can get a nominee confirmed comes down to whether or not he can get moderate Republicans to back his choice. A moderate Republican might fit the bill. The basic calculus leading to a compromise would be risk aversion. Sandoval is considerably more conservative than most Democrats, but distinctly to the left of Justice Scalia. Seating him on the bench would increase the number of cases that liberals win. In particular, it would hedge against the risk that a Republican wins in 2016 and manages to replace both Scalia and Ginsburg with conservative jurists — essentially eliminating the ""swing vote"" status of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Conversely, for Republicans, putting Sandoval on the bench would foreclose the possibility that Democrats take the White House and the Senate in November, fill the seat with a liberal, and launch the first progressive majority on the Supreme Court in two generations. Just imagine Obama announced tomorrow that he was nominating a pro-choice Republican to fill Scalia's seat. Ted Cruz would denounce it, of course, and so would Donald Trump. Marco Rubio would follow suit, as would the House Freedom Caucus. Bernie Sanders would denounce it too, and so would Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. A handful of cross-pressured senators like Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) would likely praise the gesture as bipartisanship, but they'd be a distinct minority and any hope for a deal would swiftly collapse. There's much more to the Supreme Court than abortion, but the anti-abortion movement is the emotional core of conservative activism on judicial issues. On the Democratic side of the aisle, filling the seat with a moderate Republican might actually be worse from the standpoint of labor unions who are currently looking forward to a tie on the Friedrichs case. What's more, the idea of Obama being forced to name a Republican touches the emotional core of the Democratic base — the idea that Republican obstructionism is an effort to delegitimize Obama and his presidency. Political leaks are almost never genuine leaks. Usually when something like this gets in the press it's because the key decision-makers want it to get in the press. Floating a Sandoval trial balloon in order to induce Republicans to freak out preemptively is a nice way of demonstrating to America's political journalists that Senate Republicans are not currently interested in compromise. Obama leaking that he's vetting Sandoval makes sense. Actually nominating him seems like a crazy play. That would be a good way to lay the groundwork for the nomination of a solid progressive. Republicans will, obviously, block a solidly progressive nominee which will lead to some criticism of Obama for not making a more conciliatory choice. The Sandoval leak helps establish that conciliation might not work. Imagine the Supreme Court vacancy lingers through the November election, and when all the votes are counted Hillary Clinton is president-elect but Republicans still hold a majority of Senate seats. Now everyone's hopes and dreams will have been frustrated and there will still be a need to do something about that Supreme Court vacancy. Suddenly a pro-choice Republican governor with a fairly conservative record but also a history of compromise and deal-making looks like a pretty reasonable compromise choice.",https://www.vox.com/2016/2/25/11110844/brian-sandoval-supreme-court,,Vox
92,92,21-07-16 00:00,2016,7,21,Michelle Conlin,Exclusive: Trump considering fracking mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary - sources,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump’s campaign.  The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump’s pro-drilling energy platform.   Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump’s campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was “the leading contender” for the position.   Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job.  Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment.   Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers.  “Every time we can’t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded,” Hamm told the cheering crowd. “Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.”      Hamm, 70, became one of America’s wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota’s shale fields.  Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background.  This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.  The Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.   He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.    “FRACKER-IN-CHIEF”  Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected.  He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate.   Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change.   “Given that Hamm’s as close as we’ve got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese,” said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben.   Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

In fact, there are thousands of children who have arrived to these mud-soaked camps alone — having lost both parents to violence, or separated along the way. A recent survey by UNHCR found that 5,677 (3.3 percent) of Rohingya refugee households in Cox’s Bazar were headed by children. More than 4,800 households, or 2.8 percent, include children who have been separated from their families or remain unaccompanied. Each day, there’s increased risk that these unaccompanied children will become victims of sexual abuse or forced into the slave trade, warned the United Nations migration agency in a recent report. “We are sitting on a time bomb. If we don’t keep reacting, it could explode at any moment. They need water, shelter, food, obviously, medicine and nutrition,” said Jean-Jacques Simon, chief of communication at UNICEF Bangladesh told VICE News.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads When we think of X-rays, we generally think of the human body’s skeletal structure. But in the 1930s, one osteopathist turned his attention to the anatomy of plants and used his X-ray machine as what it fundamentally exists as: a camera. Dr. Dain L. Tasker, then head radiologist at Los Angeles’s Wilshire Hospital, cultivated a hobby of photographing individual flowers using X-ray film, resulting in beautiful black-and-white prints that highlight the graceful lines of plant forms with incredible detail. What began as a doctor’s experiments in marrying science and art yielded a collection of hundreds of striking botanical images, a selection of which are now on view in Floral Studies, an exhibition at San Diego’s Joseph Bellows Gallery. “Flowers are the expression of the love life of plants,” Tasker wrote of his photographs, as former curator and art historian Bonnie Yochelson recounts in her introduction to a monograph of his images. The poetry and beauty he saw in botany is evident in his minimal compositions: dark and diaphanous, each plant Tasker photographed stretches the length of the surface of each print. All parts are illuminated and completely exposed: we can clearly see the layers of petals that form the cup of a tulip and the carpels usually concealed in a lily’s bell, now gossamer as if lightly sketched. In one radiograph, a philodendron rises tall, curving like the flame of a candle; in another, Tasker has captured a lotus from above so its petals splay like a gaping eye, with an iris surrounded by eyelashes of filaments. There is nothing difficult about taking such images, Tasker apparently noted, with the only requirements being “an abiding patience” and a knowledge of “flowers and their habits.” Still, he struggled at first to produce proper prints from his X-ray negatives. Initially an amateur photographer of landscapes and portraits, Tasker first started exploring the artistic possibilities of radiology after seeing an X-ray photograph of an amaryllis taken by a physicist he knew. With no formal training in photography but desiring to better his techniques, Tasker reached out to Will Connell, who was then teaching photography at Art Center College of Design. In addition to supervising Tasker’s printing processes, Connell also helped the doctor’s works go on display at the 1931 and 1932 annual salons organized by the Camera Pictorialists of Los Angeles as well as at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Tasker’s radiographs eventually made their way into national photography magazines, from US Camera’s October 1939 issue to Popular Photography’s March 1942 issue. Other prints he gave as gifts to his nursing students upon their graduation. Today, radiographs created for non-medical purposes are common: natural history museums, for instance, take X-ray photographs of specimens to examine them without damage. A number of artists— Albert C. Koetsier, Steven Meyers, and Nick Veasey, for instance — also document the hidden skeletons of our world. Tasker stands as a pioneer of botanical radiographs; especially emerging from a period when radiography was young and scientists’ understanding of radiation was still developing, his images represent the new intrigue in using technology to examine the structure of matter — not only in the name of science, but in his case, to also find an unexpected beauty in nature. Floral Studies continues at Joseph Bellows Gallery (7661 Girard Avenue  La Jolla, Calif.) through February 19.",https://hyperallergic.com/269028/a-radiologists-x-ray-photographs-of-flowers-from-the-1930s/,,Hyperallergic

96,96,26-09-17 09:00,2017,9,26,Rani Molla,Where the software industry is growing outside Silicon Valley,"Software companies are contributing an outsized share of growth to the U.S. economy — and not just in Silicon Valley. The software industry represented just 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 but 7 percent of GDP growth from 2014 to 2016, according to U.S. government data compiled by Software.org: the BSA Foundation, part of a trade group that represents big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce. Meanwhile, software jobs increased about 14 percent from 2014 to 2016, outpacing overall U.S. job growth of about 4 percent. One big takeaway: Yes, the software industry is still growing in places like Silicon Valley, where the fastest-growing big tech companies — like Apple, Google and Facebook — have traditionally located their headquarters and dollars. The top states for absolute job growth are California, Texas and New York, as well as Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida — all states with big population centers and established tech industries. But other states are also rapidly growing their nascent software industries. The two U.S. states with the largest percentage increases in software employment from 2014 to 2016 were Kansas, up 38 percent, or 6,100 jobs; and Indiana, which grew by 32 percent, or about 8,800 jobs. Idaho and North Carolina had the largest increases in software’s contribution to GDP in that time. Idaho’s software GDP increased 42 percent, or $280 million; while North Carolina’s grew 41 percent, or $3.8 billion, in two years. What’s happening? All industries, not just those centered on technology, are looking for software talent. Greater competition over a limited pool of technology employees is pushing companies to go where the employees are, according to Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at real estate firm CBRE. In its tech-talent report earlier this year, CBRE found that 63 percent of jobs in IT — a term they defined more broadly than just software — were in industries outside of tech. From precision farming in agriculture to driverless technology in automobiles, old industries require new software talent. Companies therefore are often sourcing software employees in university towns with steady supplies of computer science graduates. Secondarily, Yasukochi said, major tech hubs like the Bay Area can be prohibitively expensive as far as cost of living. Companies looking to get more bang for their buck, and employees looking to make their salaries go further, are sometimes choosing software jobs in lower-cost cities. Some recent examples: In May, Salesforce, which has its second-largest presence after San Francisco in Indianapolis, opened a new office tower — the tallest in Indianapolis. The company also promised to add 800 new jobs in Indianapolis within five years. This summer, Indian software company Infosys and Swiss financial institution Credit Suisse upped their presence in the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area, known as the Research Triangle for its proximity to universities. Take a closer look at GDP and employment growth by state here: For this report, Software.org commissioned the Economist Intelligence Unit to analyze their own data, along with data from Implan, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. They determined software jobs to include software publishers, computer systems design and related services, data processing, hosting and related services and internet publishing and broadcasting and web services.

99,99,22-12-17 18:50,2017,12,22,Anna North,More than 50 people have faced consequences after sexual misconduct allegations. But not Trump.,"Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the company he co-founded. Matt Lauer is gone from NBC. Mario Batali has stepped away from his restaurants. What was striking about putting together a list of people who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct in recent months was not necessarily the prevalence of the problem — unfortunately, women and gender-nonconforming people have long been aware of the sheer ubiquity of sexual harassment and violence. What was surprising — what felt new about this time in American history — was that of 105 people Vox included on the list, more than 50 have faced legal or professional consequences, from job suspensions to jail time. It’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact of #MeToo will be, but in a number of individual cases, it has produced swift action. And yet perhaps the most powerful man on the list — President Donald Trump — so far has avoided any consequences at all. Trump has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or other misconduct by more than a dozen women, and has been caught on tape bragging that “when you’re a star,” women let you “grab ’em by the pussy.” Despite all this, he remains the country’s chief executive and commander-in-chief, and his press secretary has brushed aside the allegations against him by saying, “the people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump.” There are many reasons Trump hasn’t faced the same consequences as Weinstein and others, starting with the fact that Republicans in Congress — and voters — chose to support him despite women’s reports that he had harassed or assaulted them. Members of Congress criticized him, and a few even withdrew their endorsements, but House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ultimately stayed behind him, just as they do today. It’s possible that this support could ebb. Trump’s lawyers are fighting a defamation lawsuit by Summer Zervos, who says Trump kissed and touched her without her consent in 2007 — her lawyers have subpoenaed all Trump campaign documents relating to “any woman alleging that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately.” If that suit makes it to the discovery phase, the American people could learn a lot more about the allegations against Trump. Meanwhile, several women who say Trump harassed or assaulted them are calling for a congressional investigation into his behavior. They have been joined in their call by a group of Democrats in the House. “The #MeToo movement has arrived and sexual abuse will not be tolerated, whether it’s by a Hollywood producer, the chef of a restaurant, a member of Congress or the president of the United States,” said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-FL) earlier this month. “No man or woman is above the law.” For now, though, the reckoning that began when Bill O’Reilly was forced out at Fox News and accelerated enormously when the revelations about Weinstein broke has left many behind. It has yet to offer much visibility to women of color in low-wage jobs — many of whom, as Vox’s P.R. Lockhart notes, face multiple barriers to reporting harassment. And it has yet to require any accountability of the man who once bragged about his ability to grab women’s genitals, and who today holds power over many aspects of women’s lives. The coming year will almost surely bring more reports of harassment and assault, more names for the list. Whether it brings real consequences for one of the most boldface names remains to be seen.",https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/22/16809934/sexual-misconduct-trump-the-reckoning,,Vox
100,100,16-03-16 03:30,2016,3,16,Andrew Prokop,Here's the math for Bernie Sanders going forward. It doesn't look good.,"Bernie Sanders fell so far behind Hillary Clinton Tuesday night that it's all but impossible for him to catch her, barring some sudden and seismic change in the race. Last week, I wrote a post laying out what would have to happen for Bernie Sanders to pull off an improbable comeback victory. And in Tuesday's elections, he didn't even come close to those targets. The votes are still being counted in some states, and Sanders was leading Missouri at press time. But Democratic proportional delegate allocation rules mean that if a race in a state is close, the identity of the winner barely matters — both candidates will get a comparable amount of delegates. The states that matter the most for the delegate count are, instead, the landslides. Before Tuesday, Clinton had already built up a lead of 215 pledged delegates over Sanders due mainly to her landslide victories across the South. And the landslides tonight all went in Clinton's favor. At press time, she was: So since Illinois and Missouri are close races where the delegates will be split pretty much evenly, Clinton's pledged delegate lead will expand substantially as a result of these blowout wins — from 215 to around 315. And of course, that's not even to mention Clinton's enormous superdelegate lead. Here's how rough the math is for Sanders going forward: To win a majority in pledged delegates, he needs to win 58 percent of those remaining. That might not sound so bad. But because all the Democratic contests allot their delegates proportionally, it's actually punishingly difficult. It means Sanders has to beat Clinton by around 58 percent to 42 percent pretty much constantly. And that's just incredibly implausible given what's happened so far, and especially given what's happened tonight. Even unexpected wins for Sanders in big states like California, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey — already unlikely — wouldn't be enough. Sanders has to win those states by enormous margins. And there are still a great deal of delegates left in states and territories with large nonwhite populations — states with demographics similar to those that have favored Clinton so far. These include Maryland, Arizona, New Mexico, and even Puerto Rico (which Clinton won in a blowout in 2008). Plus, any further Clinton victory just makes the targets Sanders has to hit even more absurd. At this point, the only thing Sanders can really hope for is that some scandal emerges that tanks Clinton's numbers everywhere. Other than that, she's well on track for an easy victory.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/15/11243398/bernie-sanders-election-results-2016-winning,,Vox
101,101,16-05-18 00:00,2018,5,16,Phil Stewart,"For Pentagon, South Korea drills became a crucial but quiet endeavor","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Before North Korea’s condemnation of U.S.-South Korea military drills, even U.S. policy wonks who follow every twist and turn of events on the Korean peninsula probably did not know much about them. That was no accident.  The Pentagon made a point of keeping the annual exercises off the front pages, even as U.S. military leaders including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saw them as critical to the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  Mattis set an explicit policy of going quiet on North Korea, including on the drills, two months ago, just after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled his willingness to hold an unprecedented meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.   “I do not want to talk about Korea at all,” Mattis told a small group of reporters on March 10 as he flew from Washington,  D.C., to the Gulf state of Oman.   On Tuesday, North Korea threw into question the summit between Trump and Kim scheduled for next month, angrily blaming the drills and calling them “an intentional military provocation,” North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.  The North Korean announcement upended Mattis’ goal of carrying out the drills without intense media coverage. But it also appeared to affirm his concerns about drawing too much attention now to U.S. military activity on the Korean peninsula, which has long vexed Pyongyang.  Pyongyang has viewed the U.S.-South Korean drills as rehearsals for invasion.   In early March, South Korea’s National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong said after meeting with Kim that the North Korean leader understood that “routine” joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States would continue in spite of improving relations.  This was widely seen as a major concession by North Korea as the United States seeks its denuclearization, though Pyongyang never publicly withdrew its long-standing demand for an end to the drills.  Mattis made no secret that he feared that talking about exercises could somehow complicate the work of diplomats,  something that appears now to have happened regardless of the Pentagon’s go-quiet approach.  “What I want you to understand is that right now every word is going to be nuanced and parsed apart across different cultures, at different times of the day, in different contexts,” he told reporters in March when asked about the drills.  He said U.S. officials directly involved in the diplomatic effort should be the ones talking about North Korea.  So, the Pentagon kicked off one of its biggest annual air combat exercises, Max Thunder, with South Korea on May 14 without even issuing a statement.   It was only when North Korea appeared to throw next month’s summit into question because of the drills that the Pentagon started pulling together information for the media about them.  Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, said, “It snuck up on me.”   Pollack said he only became aware of the Max Thunder drills when the KCNA statement was issued, adding, “They (the Pentagon) have been very low key about everything.”  Max Thunder, one of two exercises being conducted, is an annual air combat drill at Gwangju air base involving more than 1,000 forces from South Korea and the United States.   Although KCNA described the drills as the “largest-ever,” the Pentagon said they were similar in size to previous years.  “During Max Thunder, U.S. and (South Korean) aircrews have the ability to fly missions in realistic scenarios. This type of training is integral to our ability to safeguard the Korean Peninsula together,” a Pentagon spokesman said.  Max Thunder is scheduled to end on May 25 and the other exercise, Foal Eagle, is expected to run until the end of May. The summit between Trump and Kim is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.  Kim’s latest move could be aimed at testing Trump’s willingness to make concessions ahead of the summit, which is due to be preceded by a visit to Washington next week by South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  Bonnie Glaser of Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said Kim may be being influenced by Chinese President Xi Jinping after two recent meetings with him. The Chinese leader has advocated a freeze in North Korea’s nuclear program in return for a freeze in U.S.-South Korean drills.  That concession was previously ruled out by U.S. and South Korean officials.  “The fact this issue is back on the table suggests Xi Jinping may have raised it with Kim, and that Kim is carrying Xi’s water,” she said.

And now they’re taking to social media, using the hashtag #shutdownstories, to air their complaints about the shutdown, letting the public and lawmakers know that not getting paid isn’t easy for working families — especially during the holidays.  A mother worried about paying for her diabetic son’s insulin treatments. Another mother voiced concern about making rent without pay on meager savings. Yet another government worker said he would have to choose between healthcare and rent if the shutdown persists. One man, in a now-deleted tweet, said the shutdown left him homeless.  The shutdown is estimated to affect 800,000 workers, 380,000 of whom are furloughed, at home without pay, according to estimates from the Senate Appropriations Committee. The other 420,000 federal workers are deemed “essential,” and will have to keep working without pay through the shutdown.  Most government employees expect to eventually get back pay when the spending bill is passed and the government reopens. But government contractors aren’t so lucky: they're essentially jobless until then. In the meantime, many of these federal and contracted workers are taking to social media to share their strife, using the hashtag #shutdownstories. The Trump administration isn’t giving workers much hope that the impasse will end anytime soon either. No votes are scheduled in Congress this week, and Trump has shown little appetite for a compromise, vowing to keep the government shuttered for as long as it takes.  And if that doesn't work, he's made it clear he's more than happy to blame Democrats. But the voting public, doesn’t seem to agree with the president, and his approval rating is dipping as the shutdown drags on, according to a new poll.

He does this a lot. He picks up and drives around a few hundred square miles of the US, stopping off in his fans' apartments as he goes, playing delicate acoustic shows to the couple dozen people who sit on the carpets at his feet. You'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a parallel between Bazan's upbringing in the church and his current touring format; it's all very New Testament. But beyond that disciple instinct, the former Pedro the Lion auteur is also uniquely cut out for all this as a performer.   His new single, ""The Ballad of Pedro y Blanco,"" is a clear example. Like the rest of his forthcoming fifth solo album Care, it's entirely synth-driven, all glitches bright arpeggiated sparkles. But Bazan's baritone is steady, so close to the front of the mix that you forget about the backdrop entirely. He could have played the track on an acoustic guitar, an 808, a grand piano, or a set of tuned garbage cans; you'd still be fixed on Bazan's narrative arc and stoic, soft delivery.  Lyrically, Bazan is at his sharpest, telling a two peoples' life stories over five verses: ""Pair off with the one you like the best,"" ""Look out here come two little ones,"" ""in love and the money's alright."" He doesn't shirk from the tragedy at the end, either. It's sweet and succinct with nothing left in without purpose.  We asked Bazan about the track and he responded with this quote from the Coen Brothers' 1987 movie Raising Arizona, starring Nicholas Cage.  Listen to ""The Ballad of Pedro y Blanco"" below.

105,105,04-10-17 00:00,2017,10,4,Tess Owen,Facebook tried to sell me a bump stock like the Vegas gunman used,"The “bump stock” — an obscure accessory that transforms a semi-automatic assault rifle into a rapid-fire machine gun — has been widely available for purchase online and in gun stores across the country for years.  And then it was used in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  On Tuesday, the devices — commonly sold under the “Slide Fires” brand — were listed online by Walmart and hunting equipment giant Cabela’s at prices ranging from about $90 to $300. But by Wednesday, Slide Fires had vanished from both companies’ websites. Cabela’s and Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment from VICE News.  Their disappearance coincides with the news that gunman Stephen Paddock was equipped with 12 bump stocks for the 23 firearms he had on hand when he mowed down revelers at a country music festival in Las Vegas from his 32nd-floor hotel room on Sunday night. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured.  Bump stocks allow shooters to unleash a hail of bullets by harnessing the gun’s recoil to rapidly pull the trigger and mimic automatic fire. The devices made it possible for Paddock to fire approximately 90 rounds every 10 seconds, according to audio analysis of the gunfire.

The devices made it possible for Paddock to fire approximately 90 rounds every 10 seconds, according to audio analysis of the gunfire.  Earlier this week, bump stocks were still being marketed aggressively by online retailers and through ads on Facebook. Like many Americans, I’d never heard of a bump stock until the aftermath of Sunday’s mass shooting, but soon after I started perusing listings for bump stocks, Cabela’s targeted me with an ad for one in my Facebook feed. The particular bump stock that appeared on my feed was the popular “Slide Fire” — the Mercedes Benz of bump stocks — sold at Cabela’s for just $169.99. “Safe, fun and legal,” Cabela’s website said. “Unleash freedom.”  Facebook did not respond to VICE News’ request for comment. There’s no legal reason not to aggressively market bump stocks. In 2012, in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, led an effort to outlaw the devices, but her bill died in the Senate. The Las Vegas massacre has prompted renewed concern among other lawmakers besides Feinstein, who reintroduced the bill.  “I don’t know anybody who goes deer hunting that needs to retrofit a gun to fire hundreds of rounds per minute,” Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, told NBC News. “It’s to slaughter people.” Even some Republicans weighed in, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dean Heller of Nevada.  Just like guns tend to sell well after mass shootings, it’s possible bump stocks are flying off the shelves post-Vegas. Half of the “Slide Fires” for AR-15s (the priciest ones, at that) on Slide Fire Solutions’ website are currently out of stock. On Tuesday, I called around various Cabela’s locations to inquire about their in-store supply of bump stocks. At a Hudson, Massachusetts, location, they didn’t have any devices left in-store, but the shop assistant told me I could purchase one online and I wouldn’t need any ID, because it’s not an actual firearm.  At a Cabela’s location in Henrico, Virginia, they had only one Slide Fire left, priced at $279.99. The assistant there told me that I would need to show proof of age to purchase in-store, but nothing else. At another in Fort Mill, South Carolina, they also had one Slide Fire left, a cheaper model priced at $199.88.  There weren’t many reviews for “Slide Fires” on Cabela’s website, but most of them were positive. “A fun way to waste ammunition,” one customer wrote last month, and gave it four stars. “Loads of FUN,” wrote Mike from West Virginia. “If you enjoy shooting your AR, this makes it a blast. You can empty a 30-round map in seconds and smile like crazy spending $$$$ at the same time.”  “Most fun you can have with your clothes on,” wrote another satisfied customer.  Slide Fire Solutions is based out of Moran, Texas. Their website credits the invention of the bump stock to Jeremiah Cottle, a U.S. Army veteran who served during the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts, as well as in the Middle East during Operation Enduring Freedom. “The honor, commitment, and perseverance that is practiced in our U.S. Military is carried over to the core beliefs and practices of our company,” the company’s website states.  Their products are manufactured to accommodate both right- and left-handed users.

DALLAS (AP) — Jurors are now deciding the fate of a former Texas police officer who was convicted of murder for fatally shooting a black, unarmed teenager last year in suburban Dallas. Wednesday marks the second day of the sentencing phase in the trial of Roy Oliver, who was convicted Tuesday for the 2017 slaying of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. Edwards was killed when Oliver, a police officer in Balch Springs at the time, fired into a car full of black teenagers as it drove away from a house party. In a rare guilty verdict in a police shooting case, the Dallas County jurors were not swayed by Oliver's claim that he feared for his partner's life when he fired into the vehicle. His partner told jurors he didn't fear for his life. Gasps echoed around the courtroom as the verdict was read. Edwards' relatives sobbed and hugged prosecutors, waved their hands in the air and proclaimed ""Thank you, Jesus!"" after the jury left. His father, Odell Edwards, briefly spoke outside the courtroom before heading back in to begin listening to the sentencing phase of the trial. He said he was thankful for the decision of the jury — which featured two black members out of 12 jurors and two alternates — and felt like jumping for joy. ""I just want to say I'm happy, very happy,"" he said, adding that it's ""been a long time"" since he felt that way. Jurors later heard from Edwards' father when he testified during the sentencing phase of the trial. He told them his son always had a smile on his face and dreamed of playing football at Alabama. Oliver faces between five and 99 years in prison, according to an Edwards family attorney. Oliver and his partner were responding to a report of underage drinking at the house party. Police initially said the vehicle backed up toward officers ""in an aggressive manner,"" but later said that bodycam video showed the vehicle was moving forward as officers approached. Oliver was fired just days after the shooting. Experts say it's extremely rare for police officers to be tried and convicted of murder for shootings that occurred while they were on duty. Only six non-federal police officers have now been convicted of murder in such cases — and four of those were overturned — since 2005, according to data compiled by criminologist and Bowling Green State University professor Phil Stinson. Stinson, who tracks such cases nationwide , told The Associated Press on Tuesday that to secure a murder conviction, the facts of a case have to be ""so over the top and bizarre"" that the officer's actions can't be rationally explained. Experts also say that securing a conviction against an officer is often a challenge because jurors are inclined to believe police testimony and criminal culpability in such cases is subjective. Oliver was found not guilty on two lesser charges of aggravated assault stemming from the shooting. Jurors deliberated for two days before reaching the verdicts. The sentencing phase stretched into the evening Tuesday before jurors recessed for the day. ""This was a long fought battle,"" said Daryl Washington, an attorney representing Odell Edwards in a civil lawsuit filed in the death. ""We are just happy ... that Roy Oliver is gonna have to do his time for taking Jordan's life. What he did on that night should have never happened."" Washington said black children and teenagers across the country can now walk around a little safer because officers know they will be held accountable. In closing arguments, defense attorneys told jurors they needed to evaluate the circumstances from Oliver's viewpoint and from what the former officer knew at the time. But prosecutors described Oliver as out of control and looking for a reason to kill. They argued that his firing into the car wasn't reasonable. The shooting came after Oliver and his partner, Tyler Gross, had broken up the party. Both officers were inside the residence when they heard gunfire outside and responded. Authorities later determined the shots were fired near a nursing home in the area. Oliver retrieved his rifle and went toward Gross, who was ordering the car carrying Edwards to stop. Oliver testified that he saw the car back up and stop for a second before moving forward and going toward Gross. Oliver told the jury the car was about to hit his partner. Oliver said he felt he had no other option but to fire. Gross, however, testified that he did not fear for his life and never felt the need to fire his weapon. He also said he didn't feel like the vehicle was trying to hit him. Prosecutors said Oliver fired after the vehicle passed Gross. Investigators also said no guns were found in the teens' vehicle.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-texas-cop-found-guilty-of-murdering-black-teen-faces-99-years-2018-8,,Business Insider
107,107,09-11-17 21:24,2017,11,9,Sarah Emerson,Twitter Verification Has Always Been a Mess," Twitter wants to fix its long-broken verification process, according to the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. The means by which users obtain “a blue checkmark” are nebulous and seemingly biased, and the system’s flaws were exposed after Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was verified this week.  Kessler’s new credential caused many to fault Twitter for tacitly endorsing the ideals he espouses—essentially, white supremacy. The verification process, according to Twitter, is supposed to authenticate a person’s identity. But, instead, it’s created a hierarchy of “Very Important Tweeters,” or “VITs,” as they are referred to internally by staff.   What does it mean when VITs include racists and bigots?  While Twitter’s verification steps are now automated, at one point, users could only snag a blue checkmark by knowing someone within the company. According to a former Twitter employee, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, the process was once very difficult. (A few years ago, there wasn’t even a form to apply for a verification.)  And while the process was never explicitly preferential, it engendered the belief that “it was a big deal for us to get a famous person verified, as if it validated that Twitter continued to be important,” they said.  Twitter’s own rules say that accounts of public interest may qualify for verification. Users must submit several ID types to receive a badge. That can include a government-issued ID, like a passport, and summary of why you deserve to be verified. Submissions are largely vetted by Twitter Support, which dumps applicants into various buckets: celebrity, journalist, athlete, business, politician, etc.  But some people claim the Twitter verification process hasn’t worked that way for them. Rebecca Watson, a popular science podcaster and founder of Skepchick, who has been prominent enough for years to reasonably be considered an “account of public interest,” claims she submitted multiple forms of ID to verify herself after people created fake accounts impersonating her. Still, at the time, Twitter refused to verify her.  Kessler, meanwhile, describes himself as a “freelance journalist” for far-right publications: “I must be the only working class white advocate [to be verified],” he tweeted.  The Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA, convened white supremacist and neo-Nazi demonstrators, and caused the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, when 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.   While Twitter’s official line has always been that verification isn’t a value judgment by the company, in practice that hasn’t been the case. For example, verified users can sort their mentions to only include tweets from other verified users. While Twitter claims that verification exists only as a means of identification, verified users are widely perceived to be more important or valued than unverified ones.  The former employee told me that the issue of problematic users asking for verification was regularly raised on Falquora, an internal forum where employees can pose questions to management.  “Leadership claimed that verification was working as intended. Every time it became a big issue, [the verification of white supremacist Richard Spencer, for example,] it would come up on Falquora as a thing,” the former Twitter employee said.  The issue of controversial users being verified would “get upvoted, and either Jack [Dorsey], Vijaya [Gadde, Twitter's general counsel], or other leaders would get up on stage and give us a speech about how verification is only about confirming that a person is who they say they are.”  A spokesperson for Twitter emphasized that verification has been a known problem, and directed me to Dorsey’s tweet on the matter.  Despite Dorsey’s claim, however, former Twitter staff insist that one fix was suggested repeatedly.  If tiers of verified users were assigned colored badges—still reserving the blue checkmark for influential people—this would allow regular users to authenticate themselves without the onus, or implications, of being a “VIT.”  “The colored verification badges have been brought up internally SO MANY TIMES. I don't know why that hadn't been implemented yet,” another former Twitter employee, who also spoke to me on the condition of anonymity because of a non disclosure agreement, told me. “Everything there is so process heavy that it takes forever, and too many approvals need to happen before anything ever gets done.”  “I know people that deserve to be verified that definitely had a very hard time getting it, and some never did,” they added.  Twitter leadership allegedly dismissed the colored badge solution, favoring a larger platform revamp. But when management was challenged on  how that revamp would happen or help, exactly, staff were never given a satisfactory answer.   Regarding the existing verification process, some Twitter employees have taken steps toward transparency. Twitter’s GM of consumer product and engineering, Ed Ho, questioned whether the company should even dole out a credential as authoritative as the checkmark.  This week’s incident reiterates how unwilling Twitter is to discuss problems inherent to its platform—until it’s forced to. Less than a week ago, a customer service contractor briefly disabled President Trump’s Twitter account, compelling the company to acknowledge flaws with its admin privileges.   A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment on how the company plans to improve the verification process.

""We think we've done our homework here and we're confident we've come up with a good product."" Aside from physical acts like kicking, pushing, hair pulling, or pinching, the bylaw would punish anyone over the age of 12 for ""shunning, ostracizing, excluding another person and gossiping and rumour mongering,"" as well as taunting, tormenting, name calling, ridiculing, insulting, mocking and directing slurs towards another person. A first-time offender could be fined up to $300, while subsequent offences could land one with a fine of up to $2,500. But the bylaw does leaves room for the conflict to be resolved through mediation if both parties agree to take part. City solicitor Patricia Warwick told the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix that legal staff were ""careful"" to take issues the right to freedom of expression into account when writing the law. ""We think we've done our homework here and we're confident we've come up with a good product,"" she said. But Zwibel believes the language is too broad and ""potentially vague,"" citing the possibility of the bylaw being used to justify, for example, kicking out members of the public from meetings when they are critical of officials.

Related: Rehtaeh Parsons' Death Inspired a Cyberbullying Law in Canada — But Does It Hurt Free Speech? Councillor Ann Iwanchuk, who requested that the bylaw be drafted in the first place, told VICE News that while the law is generally well-drafted, certain elements, like the definition of bullying itself, need clarification. Iwanchuk requested that a bylaw be drafted in February 2014 after being particularly moved by a Saskatoon resident who spoke to city council about her daughter's struggles with bullying. ""Her daughter attempted suicide...and that brought home to me how serious this is,"" she said. ""When this girl awoke from a coma two weeks later and actually was disappointed that she wasn't successful in her suicide, so it wasn't even a wake up call. ""There's going to be wording that'll change, and there will be defense lawyers that will rip this thing apart."" ""If we can curb that behaviour so that they don't bring it into adulthood, into our workforce, I think we're doing a positive thing for our city,"" she said. She is concerned, however, as drafted, the bylaw could entice ""frivolous complaints."" ""What is the trigger to a complaint? Is it that somebody didn't look at you correctly? You need to make sure it's for serious, repeated, and abusive behaviour,"" she continued. Iwanchuk also questioned why the proposed bylaw includes private establishments. ""I don't see how prolonged bullying could take place in a private establishment,"" she said. ""If you're at a nightclub, you could leave. You'd probably have other options."" Retired Saskatoon police Sgt. Brian Trainor told VICE News the bylaw, which doesn't make the offences criminal, could be helpful to police. ""I think a bylaw is necessary because it gives police a soft tool to use in cases of bullying,"" he said, but added that he wonders if the wording of the bylaw could be ""misapplied."" ""When it's talking about what is bullying — taunting and all those things — that gets to be fairly vague."" He adds, however, that the bylaw is a starting point that will most likely change. ""There's going to be wording that'll change, and there will be defense lawyers that will rip this thing apart,"" he said. Two versions of the bylaw, which could come into effect just in time for the new school year in September, are to be considered by city council — one which would apply to school property during school hours, and another one that doesn't. The report notes that school boards have ""expressed that they already have sufficient tools and safeguards in place to address bullying behaviour in schools."" It would be up to the Saskatoon Police Service to figure out how the bylaw would be enforced.

109,109,11-02-19 00:00,2019,2,11,Zachary Fagenson,"For Parkland survivors, a year of political gains and unresolved pain","PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - A year after the deadliest high-school shooting in U.S. history, students from Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School look back with pride on the network they have built to stem the country’s epidemic of gun violence through the ballot box.  Even so, it has been difficult for many to come to terms with the trauma of Feb. 14, 2018, when a former Stoneman student with an assault gun massacred 17 people at the Parkland, Florida campus.  “There’s definitely not a day that goes by where I’m not thinking about it, and I know for a fact that everyone that has to walk through those campus gates is thinking about it,” said junior Caitlynn Tibbetts.  The student campaign in support of gun control, which featured a massive march on Washington and in other cities around the country, resulted in the formation of a sprawling national network called March for Our Lives.  With some 500 chapters, it has linked tens of thousands of student activists in pushing for political candidates who support their goals of new measures to reduce gun violence.  “We have to replace these terrible actors who are comfortable putting our lives at risk for a check from the NRA,” said Matt Deitsch, the group’s chief strategist, referring to the National Rifle Association, which opposes what it considers any retreat on gun rights.  Deitsch, along with Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr and Jaclyn Corin, is among the most prominent Stoneman students who have toured the nation to encourage young people to register and vote for pro-gun control candidates.  By “terrible actors,” Deitsch was referring to political incumbents who oppose the group’s goals, which include a ban on assault weapons. It also backs funding for gun violence research and supports universal background checks, disarming domestic abusers and enacting laws to staunch gun trafficking.   “The fact that gun violence is a top issue for the first time ever is something that should scare the people arrayed against us,” Deitsch, 21, said with evident pride.  Having put together a multimillion-dollar war chest, with the help of A-list celebrities like George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, the network aims to expand to thousands of high schools and colleges by the end of 2019, giving it even more clout going into the 2020 election.   On Monday, activists were to launch a petition campaign to put an assault weapons ban on Florida’s ballot in the 2020 election. March For Our Lives leader Hogg, among the first Stoneman students to call for greater gun control in the hours after the shooting, was expected to attend the campaign kickoff, along with parents of some of the victims. The petition needs 800,000 signatures.   Success has come at a cost for the student activists. Since last year’s shooting, many have not had enough time to grieve or properly process the tragedy.   In a series of recent Twitter messages, Tarr, a March for Our Lives co-founder, reflected on having to put on a composed “performance” over the past year as a public figure on social media.   “I can’t sit back and let you think that I’m always fine, that I’m always ready to go. That’s not realistic,” she wrote. “I’m a human being and god damn if all of this work and pain isn’t hard.”  The past year has brought more U.S. gun violence, complicating the task of recovery. In a shooting with echoes of Parkland, a gunman at Santa Fe High School in Texas killed 10 and wounded 14 on May 18. Months later, an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead and six injured.   By the end the year, that pair of shootings, combined with hundreds of others, left a total of 387 dead, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  “We carry a heavy weight, and every single day there’s another mass shooting in America, and we see ourselves as vessels amplifying what’s going on this country,” Deitsch said.  For many students, sharing their experiences, both broadly and with those who have gone through something similar, has been therapeutic, however.  Not long after the shooting, a publisher contacted Sarah Lerner, a journalism and English teacher at Stoneman, about publishing a book filled with reflections of that day and its aftermath.   “Parkland Speaks: Survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas Share Their Stories” was released late last month and includes 43 accounts of the shooting and what followed, including two pieces by Tibbetts, the junior.  “This book gave us the opportunity to look past politics and look at the heart of it,” Tibbetts said. “And the heart of it is that we’re struggling to move past it, but we’re trying.”  Reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Editing by Frank McGurty and Tom Brown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-anniversary-students/for-parkland-survivors-a-year-of-political-gains-and-unresolved-pain-idUSKCN1Q0136,U.S.,Reuters
110,110,28-09-18 00:00,2018,9,28,Martyn Herman,Finau fires first shot as 42nd Ryder Cup gets underway,"PARIS (Reuters) - American rookie Tony Finau got the first Ryder Cup staged in France under way on Friday as thousands of fans descended on the Le Golf National for the biennial clash of the continents.  The peace of the countryside near to historic Versaille was shattered as fans streamed in to find vantage points around the pristine Albatros course for the eagerly-awaited 42nd edition of one of sport’s most compelling team events.  Looming behind the first tee, the Ryder Cup’s biggest ever grandstand was packed to its near 7,000-capacity long before the players emerged across a footbridge to start their rounds at just past 8 a.m. local time.  Deafening chants of “Europe, Europe” echoed down the first fairway as Justin Rose and Spanish rookie Jon Rahm reached the tee to take on Finau and three-times major winner Brooks Koepka.  Defending champions United States are looking to win on European soil for the first time for 25 years and have resurgent 14-times major winner Tiger Woods to spearhead their challenge.  While the support was overwhelmingly in favor of the hosts, there was plenty of loud backing for the Americans too, with many of their countryman sporting stars and stripes outfits.  The atmosphere was more akin to a soccer match as the day’s fourballs began with a smattering of partisan pantomime boos greeting the announcement of the American team.  The banter was generally good-natured, however.  “It’s fantastic, so much energy so early in the morning,” Josh Hunking from Texas, watching his first Ryder Cup in Europe, said. “I’ve never heard Europeans make so much noise.”  It all proved too much for Finau, whose iron off the tee went way left, just avoiding water — Europe’s fans showing no mercy as they reveled in his understandably nervy start.  Koepka steadied the ship with a straighter drive but the day’s first hole went to Europe with Rose sinking a birdie to thunderous roars from the stacked crowds around the first green.  Finau, U.S. captain Jim Furyk’s final pick, joined the party with a chip-in eagle at the sixth to level match one.  The day’s second match featured Danish newcomer Thorbjorn Olesen playing alongside Rory McIlroy against world number one Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler.  World number 45 Olesen, the lowest ranked of the 24 players taking part, looked dry-mouthed as he addressed his ball on the first tee and sent a nervy drive into water.  Whichever colors they were wearing, the arrival of Woods for his first Ryder Cup shot for six years, was the moment many had arrived so early to witness.  The 42-year-old responded with a drive that landed safely on the first fairway.  Woods, playing with self-styled “Captain America” Patrick Reed, was up against British Open champion Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, one of five rookies in the Europe team.  Following the quartet of morning fourballs, the afternoon will see four foursomes matches, in which team mates play alternate shots using the same ball.  The U.S. need a minimum of 14 points from the weekend’s matches to retain the trophy.  Around a quarter of a million tickets have been sold for the week with around 70,000 expected to follow the action on Friday.  The spectacular 7,234-yard layout offers superb viewing for fans with grassy banks flanking the fairways and most greens set in natural amphitheatres.  There are also 18 huge jumbotrons around the grounds to keep fans up-to-date with all the day’s twists and turns.

111,111,01-06-16 01:44,2016,6,1,Ina Fried,The Gates Foundation is trying to stop Zika by giving mosquitos a sexually transmitted disease,"Ordinarily the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is in the business of stopping diseases rather than spreading them. When it comes to mosquitoes, though, the foundation is funding an approach that aims to spread a disease among mosquitoes that would prevent those bugs from spreading Zika and other diseases. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann showed off a kit at Code Conference on Tuesday that looks like a Chinese food take-out box that contains female mosquito eggs that have been infected with a bacteria. When these insects are born, they will produce offspring that is unable to transmit a variety of diseases, including Zika. Part of the reason the foundation is focused on this approach is that Zika itself wasn't on anyone's radar as far as serious disease threats. Past outbreaks caused only flu-like symptoms and not the birth defects and other serious issues that the current Zika outbreak is causing. ""Zika wasn’t on anyone’s list,"" Desmond-Hellman said. By contrast, Ebola was seen as a potential bioterrorism risk so the global health community was at least a ""tiny bit"" prepared for the 2014 outbreak. Even Ebola had in the past been limited to just 2,000 cases. The Gates Foundation has been funding the Australian researchers behind the STD approach for more than eight years, originally to halt the threat of Dengue fever, though the same approach should also help fight the spread of Zika, as well as Chikungunya, another serious mosquito-borne disease.

112,112,09-11-16 18:42,2016,11,9,Ina Fried,Former Microsoft executive Doug Burgum is North Dakota’s next governor,"Another businessman-turned-politician was elected Tuesday, though with significantly less controversy. Former Microsoft executive Doug Burgum won his bid to become the governor of North Dakota, fueled by a socially moderate, fiscally conservative campaign. Burgum, who sold his Great Plains Software business to Microsoft in 2002 for $1.1 billion, laid out his plans in a January email interview with Recode. “The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government,” Burgum said. “I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota.” Here’s an edited transcript of that interview. Recode: What made you want to run for governor? Doug Burgum: The private sector, free markets and technology are all huge positive forces that have literally helped change the world. I am grateful to have been able to spend my life as an entrepreneur in the global software industry. The role of governor is the closest thing to a CEO job in government. I have spent my working life attracting capital and talent to North Dakota. I am interested in working where I can have the biggest impact on my home state, and the role of the governor in North Dakota, among other duties, is to be the lead ambassador and cheerleader for attracting human and financial capital to the state. I have no desire to be a politician. I do want to be an elected leader. Are there lessons from your career as an entrepreneur that you feel guide your political philosophy? Yes. Competition drives innovation, lowers cost, speeds delivery and more. Most government services are monopolies, or near monopolies, and therefore have lacked the market forces that produce better solutions. And most government agencies are lagging behind private industry in technology adoption. There are big opportunities to re-invent government service delivery at all levels. Which is hardest, running your own business, working for Steve Ballmer or running for office? Each of these represent unique joys and challenges! I ran Great Plains for 18 years, worked with Steve for six and a half years, and have been running for office for 16 days. The biggest change across all three of these over the last 30 years is the nonstop, 24-hour role that social media plays in building brand, driving opinion and engaging with customers (voters). What do you make of the Republican presidential race? It has been great for TV ratings and for people who own media outlets in Iowa and New Hampshire. It remains to be seen if the process produces a viable national candidate who will be competitive in the fall. Today’s campaigns and candidates are a product of a convoluted, legacy, state-by-state primary process that would possibly not exist if one was tasked to start from scratch to invent a new process for identifying and vetting the very best individuals to serve as president of the United States. How can technology help solve some of the issues facing North Dakota? Every industry in North Dakota (and everywhere else) is facing accelerating change. Moore’s law, super-cheap storage, increasing bandwidth infrastructure and a proliferation of super low-cost, highly accurate automatic data sensors are transforming every process and workflow. There has been a truism in the tech world that “every company needs to become a software company, or be disrupted by one.” I believe this is absolutely true. We have a global oil surplus today because of the rapid advancements in technology. This stands in stark contrast to a multi-decade narrative that we were “running out of oil.” In energy exploration, some of these technologic advances that have contributed to the unforeseen abundance, such as deep horizontal drilling, were pioneered in the Bakken formation in North Dakota. Technology ranging from self-driving tractors with GPS precision, real-time soil analysis (to reduce fertilizer needs) and continued advances in hybrid seed technology are reshaping production agriculture. Health care delivery markets and systems have been completely distorted by government regulation and mandates, making our health care system less productive. These productivity losses will be compounded by demographics: We have more caregivers (doctors and nurses retiring) and more patients aging, so this will put additional pressures on our health care systems. The only way out of this productivity inversion for health care is to streamline operational workflows with automatically generated data. And our North Dakota education system, which needs to serve a significant rural as well as increasing urban population, will need to accelerate its efforts to raise outcomes to ensure students of all ages have the skills they need to be competitive in a global economy. What role is technology playing in your campaign? Our campaign team is like a lean tech startup today. We are into rapid prototyping and continuous improvement and building community. There are so many low-cost amazing tools, solutions and platforms — from social media, to fundraising, to building websites, to CRM, to accounting and more — to help us share our messages. Anything else that you want to make sure people know? I am running as a moderate on social issues and as a fiscal conservative in a state that is socially conservative but has seen government spending rise more rapidly than even our fast-growing economy (fueled by the oil boom and billions of dollars of revenue surpluses at the state level). This race will be decided on the June 14th primary. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/11/9/13575938/microsoft-doug-burgum-dakota-governor,,Vox
113,113,23-01-16 00:13,2016,1,23,Seth Partnow,Free Throw Follies: Andre Drummond Doesn't Need to Get Better from the Line,"""How can you be a professional basketball player and miss over half your free throws?"" As the ""hack-a"" strategy becomes more widely adopted in the NBA, that question gets asked more and more often. The answer is surprisingly simple: because they can be. The scene is as familiar as it is numbing. An opponent of the Rockets, the Clippers, or the Pistons decides that they'd rather simply send Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, or Andre Drummond, respectively, to the free-throw line than defend straight up. For the next several minutes of game time—and seemingly hours of real time—the action slows to a crawl as the targeted big man takes painful free throw after painful free throw. This practice reached its apotheosis (or, more accurately, its nadir) during the Rockets-Pistons game Wednesday night. After losing Howard to an ankle injury in the first minute of play, Houston sent Drummond to the line 36 times, where he missed 23 free throws, a single-game record. The Rockets even started the second half with little-used reserve K.J. McDaniels, who immediately committed five fouls in nine seconds to force Drummond to the line, and ultimately to the bench. According to ESPN's Kevin Pelton, who has been extensively tracking and discussing the issue, through January 20 there have already been 223 intentional, off-ball fouls this season, compared to 164 in all of the 2014-15 campaign. Without re-entering the intertwined debates about whether this is good strategy (in most circumstances, it's not) and what, if anything, is to be done about the practice (it's complicated, not least because imposing severe penalties for intentional fouling almost certainly means replay reviews, and all of a sudden, there goes the time saved by not fouling), it is important to address the issue that makes this strategy viable in the first place: Just how is it that someone with such an extreme deficit in the fundamental basketball skill of hitting an uncontested, (largely) untimed 15-footer can make it this far? It comes down to specialization, demographics, and how the two interrelate in today's NBA. Modern NBA basketball relies on a division of labor amongst the five players on the court. In other words, there are positions. Though many of these roles have become more elastic during the ""positional revolution"" of the past decade, teams and lineups still need a mix of several discrete skills to be successful. Ball-handling and creation. Rebounding. Outside shotmaking ability, and so on. One of these bundles of skills has come to be known as rim protection, which is based on the premise that layups are the easiest shots in basketball but become much harder if attempted in the vicinity of a very tall (even by NBA standards) man. Certainly, a good rim protector will possess other abilities in addition to great height and/or wingspan—anticipation, vision, lateral and vertical quickness, discipline—but the importance and impact of just being big is, for lack of a better term, huge. Here is where demographics come into play. Extremely tall people are such a small segment of the population that precise estimates are hard to find, but according to this calculator (which is based on Centers for Disease Control data), a 20-year-old male standing 6'10"" or taller is in the 99.9997th percentile of height for men his age. That's about three rim-protector-sized young men for every million. Meanwhile, someone 6'5'' or taller—roughly the minimum height for a NBA wing—is in the 99.5339th percentile. That might not appear to be much of gap, but it's the difference between choosing from hundreds of potential players and hundreds of thousands. Lower the height requirement to 5'10'' and suddenly you're choosing from 45 percent of the population, a pool of tens of millions. While the set of ""potential NBA players"" is far smaller than that, there are still vastly more candidates at guard size than there are for centers. While not a perfect comparison to those demographic breakdowns—both because official league heights are often slightly fictional (as in ""6-foot-13"" Kevin Garnett, who didn't want to be seven feet tall and thus forced to play center) and because people often grow somewhat taller even after age twenty—the height distribution of NBA players is telling. According to NBA.com, 124 of the 447 players who have appeared thus far this season are listed at 6'10'' or taller. By comparison, 212 players are between 6'5'' and 6'10'', leaving just 111 under 6'5''. Those numbers change year to year, but generally speaking the NBA as a whole will give jobs to a higher proportion of 6'10'' players than 6'1'' prospects, in large part because of the importance of skills like rim protection and rebounding, and due to the advantages sheer size gives in accomplishing those tasks. So while a 6'1'' point guard or even a 6'7'' small forward who can't hit free throws is unlikely to clear the many hurdles a player needs to leap to reach the NBA, a taller player is far more likely to get some leeway. A seven-footer needs to be an extreme outlier in terms of explosiveness and coordination to a degree far lower than that of his shorter peers—he's already an outlier by virtue of his size. Smaller players don't tend to be quicker, or better shooters, or more skillful because of their size. Rather, the relatively smaller players in the NBA are those things because they had to be in order to stand out sufficiently. Does this mean many taller players advance up the ladder from high school and AAU to big time college to the NBA without honing their skills and understanding of the game to the same degree as their peers? It certainly does. Through that process, bad habits develop, habits that are hard to undo by the time players reach the NBA level. Rajon Rondo has been little more successful improving as a shooter than have Drummond, Jordan, or Howard. Furthermore, there being so few players of sufficient rim-protecting size and agility allows these players to stay in the league despite whatever skill deficiencies they may have. Perhaps the most surprising part of Hassan Whiteside's rise to prominence over the past year or so is the fact that he was out of the league to begin with—players of his physical stature tend to find a spot somewhere, as demonstrated by the likes of Kendrick Perkins, JaVale McGee, and Ryan Hollins finding spots year after year. Perimeter players seem to improve as shooters as their basketball careers go on. Some of this indeed represents the players' own efforts; some of it is due to the fact that, aside from the top stars—Rondo with his playmaking, Dwyane Wade with his athleticism and shotmaking—players who do not become competent shooters tend to find themselves on the outside looking in (creating an effect known as survivorship bias). That competitive pressure does not apply to the professionally very, very, very tall to quite the same degree. To bring it back to specialization of skills: the rim protection, rebounding, and physical presence provided by those few players who happen to both be enormously tall and prodigiously athletic moves things like free-throw shooting from the ""required"" to the ""preferred but not necessary"" section of the job description. So when it comes to hack-a-big-man, NBA fans have two choices: stop complaining about players missing foul shots, or start complaining about there not being more seven-footers in the world.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xzy7n/free-throw-follies-andre-drummond-doesnt-need-to-get-better-from-the-line,Sports,Vice

115,115,06-03-18 15:00,2018,3,6,Matthew Gault,Steam Is Filled With Groups That Celebrate School Shooters," Most people use the giant online video game platform Steam to buy games and move on, but others build communities. As we've previously reported, Valve, the company that operates Steam, does very little moderating. So the platform is full of hate groups.   As the nonprofit news organization The Center for Investigative Reporting first reported on Friday, it appears Steam is also full of groups that venerate school shooters. Valve is a multi billion-dollar game company with at least 125 million users. Its code of conduct specifically prohibits racism and “threats of violence or harassment, even as a joke.” That fact that some of these groups have been allowed on a platform for years is yet another example of how Valve not only fails to enforce its own policies, but normalizes extremist thinking.   “Plan to shoot up Forest Lake state school,” a user named School Shooter 66 wrote in the Steam group School Shooting Squad group in March 2017. “I plan to bring an M16 , 3 mags, suicide pills and an axe."" The user goes on to detail his plan of attack, and clarifies in all caps that ""THIS IS NOT A JOKE.""  Other user-created Steam groups talk about school shootings, take their names from prominent school shooters, and celebrate mass killers such as Elliot Rodger, who shot six people to death near the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2014. One group, “Future School Shooter Material,” has 106 members and bills itself as “a group dedicated to the bright young minds who are tortured by bullies. Join if you want to be a future school shooter.”  Another group called “School Shoot Gang” used a picture of Columbine shooter Dylan Klebold as its avatar. “Remember Columbine High?” It asked. “That was just a warmup. For Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.” There are groups dedicated to Elliot Rodger, George Zimmerman, and Charles Manson. As of this writing, searching Steam’s groups for “school shooter” returns 248 results. Some of the groups have just a few members, while others have more than a hundred.  Many of the messages are not just violent, but also racist. “Whos in charge of shooting the ni**ers and sp**s?” A user asked in one of the Steam groups. “I thought I was but I’m not sure.”  In a group that called California murderer Elliot Rodger an American hero, one user made a vague threat to repeat Rodger’s massacre. “I am like Elliot Rodger,” the user said. “Don't you worry guys, I will prove it soon!”  We know for a fact that at least one school shooter shared his worldview on Steam before carrying out an actual shooting. William Edward Atchison posted racist ramblings and calls to violence on Steam and other online communities for years before killing two students and himself at Aztec High School in New Mexico on December 7, 2017. A Steam group named after the neo-Nazi Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi organization associated with several recent murders, regularly posted to YouTube and Steam.   Valve did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story. It has not responded to Motherboard's repeated requests for comment on this subject since October 2017.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3w9ea/steam-is-filled-with-groups-that-celebrate-school-shooters,Tech by VICE,Vice
116,116,14-10-16 00:00,2016,10,14,Benjamin Sutton,The History of Gowanus Cemented in Sculpture,"A collaboration between artist Christina Kelly and author Amy Sohn pairs cast concrete objects with true stories about long-ago Gowanus residents. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Sometimes, to make historical objects speak to contemporary viewers, you have to give them actual voices. Artist Christina Kelly and author Amy Sohn did just that with Gowanus Underworld, their collaborative project currently on view at Trestle Projects, which pairs cast concrete sculptures with monologues that narrate true stories about the neighborhood’s historic residents. An old porthole prompts the story of three Manhattan women who, in the summer of 1936, bought an old welding barge for $160 at auction and turned it into their private, floating cottage on the Gowanus Canal. A bent bulkhead nail — nearly a foot long — cues the story of Joseph Zappula, a longshoreman who, in 1950, was on the end of the human chain that pulled little Diana Svet from the Gowanus Bay. “Christina selected these objects to cast from the collection of Proteus Gowanus, and then we dove into the photos from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle archives in the Brooklyn Public Library’s Brooklyn Collection,” Sohn told Hyperallergic.”It was a matter of creating an emotional life for these real-life characters so that people can have a connection to these objects.” As part of curator Melissa Staiger‘s group show Falling In, an array of four concrete sculptures by Kelly is paired with four portable speakers, each playing one of Sohn’s accompanying monologues. Most the stories are narrated by actors and last less than two minutes, just long enough to prompt an imaginative journey in the viewer. They lend the concrete sculptures a quasi-archaeological aura, filling out the details surrounding these fragments of yesteryear’s everyday. Under a tiny cast of a gas valve, a recording tells the story of a single mother who tried to kill herself and her children to get back at their father, who’d run off with another woman. A cast chunk of the historical Coignet Building is paired with the story of Dr. John C. Goodridge, Jr., the artificial stone enthusiast who constructed the building in 1873 to both house the offices of and demonstrate the capabilities of his business, the New York and Long Island Coignet Stone Company. The company filed for bankruptcy the same year the building was completed. “We were interested in the theme of failure, which is an overarching theme related to Gowanus — the failure of industry; the failure of the environment; the failure, until recently, to redevelop the neighborhood,” Sohn said. “We all have this image of what Gowanus is becoming — this idyllic image of family life — so we were also looking for stories about families and failed families.” The final monologue, which has no corresponding sculpture, guides the viewer out of Trestle Projects and onto 6th Street. Cued up on smartphones via a QR code, the story focuses on Detective Bernard Grottano, who, in April 1915, investigated a gruesome murder at the lumber yard at 167 6th Street — an address that, as luck would have it, is still home to a lumber yard (not all Gowanus industry has failed). “You could do a whole series on murders, drownings, and suicides,” said Sohn, who hopes to expand the project with additional stories. “I’m also interested in uncovering the stories of the women who worked here. There’s a long history of women working in Gowanus, especially in the textile mills, and yet it is thought of as a very masculine area.” Or, as a policeman told the three young women in 1936 as they searched for their new barge: “That’s on the Gowanus Canal, and it’s no place for ladies!” Christina Kelly and Amy Sohn’s “Gowanus Underworld” project is part of Falling In at Trestle Projects (400 3rd Avenue, 2nd floor, Gowanus, Brooklyn) through October 22. The gallery will have special hours, 12–6pm, during Gowanus Open Studios (October 15 and 16).",https://hyperallergic.com/329644/history-gowanus-cemented-sculpture/,,Hyperallergic
117,117,24-07-18 12:26,2018,7,24,Julia Belluz,Dementia prevention: 9 behaviors could cut your risk by 35 percent,"Dementia has long been thought of as an inevitable part of aging, but researchers are increasingly learning that’s not quite true. About a third of dementia cases might actually be avoided by living a lifestyle that better protects your brain. Dementia is how we describe symptoms that impact memory and lead to a decline in cognitive performance, often in ways that disrupt daily living. There are different brain disorders that cause dementia, but Alzheimer's is the most common, followed by cerebrovascular disease and Lewy bodies disease. Around the world, some 47 million people are currently living with dementia — including more than 5 million Americans. The burden of Alzheimer’s alone on families and the health system is difficult to overstate: It’s the most expensive disease in America, costing up to $215 billion per year (more than double that of cancer or heart disease), and it can take a terrible toll on patient’s loved ones. The number of people with dementia is also expected to triple worldwide by 2050 as populations age. But there’s some good news: You might be able to modify some of your risk of developing dementia. A major Lancet report, by 24 leading dementia researchers from around the world, zeroed in on nine of the best-known lifestyle factors that contribute to the illness and account for more than a third of dementia cases. The takeaway: Addressing these factors might be able to cut our dementia risk by up to 35 percent. Another bit of good news is that the prevalence rate of dementia has declined in some countries, including in the US. And researchers think it may in part be due to increases in levels of education, which seems to protect people from getting dementia. For a disease many of us fear, the message is hopeful: Dementia is not necessarily an inevitability. Dementia symptoms typically show up in old age, but the brain changes that cause it are thought to develop years earlier. These are things that might help stave off those changes: 1) Check your hearing and get a hearing aid if you need one It’s not yet clear why, but there’s a strong correlation between even mild hearing loss and an increased risk in cognitive decline and dementia (and the dementia risk goes up with more severe hearing loss). Hearing may be important to dementia because of what study lead author, University College London professor Gill Livingston, called “the use it or lose it model.” “We get a lot of intellectual stimulation through hearing,” she told Vox after the study was published in 2017. So when a person can’t hear as well their brain may begin to shrink. Researchers think hearing aids could help reduce that risk, but they need better evidence to know that for sure. 2) Keep learning Less education is also associated with an increased risk of dementia because of something researchers call “cognitive reserve,” or a person’s resistance to assaults on the brain. “Low educational level is thought to result in vulnerability to cognitive decline because it results in less cognitive reserve,” they wrote, “which enables people to maintain function despite brain pathology.” 3) Stop smoking Smoking is bad for the brain because it degrades cardiovascular health (and interferes the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the brain). Tobacco also contains neurotoxins, which damage the brain. 4) Seek out treatment for depression It’s still not entirely clear whether depression contributes to dementia, or whether dementia puts people at an increased risk of depression. But the researchers concluded that it’s “biologically plausible” depression boosts a person’s dementia risk because it “affects stress hormones, neuronal growth factors, and hippocampal [brain] volume.” Making sure people are treated for depression could mitigate a person’s dementia risk, and the researchers said antidepressants might also help, but called for better evidence to understand the effects of the medications. 5) Exercise Exercise is believed to protect the brain by reducing cortisol levels in the body, cutting vascular risk, and increasing the growth of nerve cells that are related to memory. So people who are inactive are at a greater risk of dementia because they don’t get the extra protection exercise confers. 6) Manage high blood pressure Stress on the circulatory system increases the risk of neurodegeneration, which also contributes to dementia. 7) Be social Like depression, it’s unclear whether social isolation is a symptom or cause of dementia. “However, evidence is growing that social isolation is a risk factor for dementia and it increases the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and depression,” the researchers wrote. The theory is that social isolation is similar to not being able to hear, Livingston explained. “You need a cognitively enriched environment to keep the brain in good health, and if don’t see people or can’t hear them, you get less of that stimulation.” 8) Maintain a healthy body weight Researchers believe obesity causes brain damage because it’s linked with reduced blood flow to the brain and it increases oxidative stress, which is also bad for the brain. 9) Keep your blood sugar in check People with diabetes are more likely to have dementia. One reason why: Having diabetes means you can no longer control your blood sugars. And having more sugar in your blood stream means more sugar in your organs, including the brain. So just as diabetes can damage other organs in the body, it also damages the brain. This list of nine contributors is only the beginning. The scientific community is already learning about other potential contributors to dementia, such as exposure to pollution and lack of sleep. “So we don’t think this [list of nine things] is everything but this is what we have evidence on now,” said Livingston in 2017. There are other caveats to note about this research. Some of the factors — such as hearing loss, or social isolation — are again associated with dementia, but whether they cause dementia isn’t yet clear, and researchers are working to better understand dementia’s causes. What’s more, not all cases of dementia are preventable; about 7 percent are linked with genetics and can’t be modified with lifestyle changes. And, the researchers wrote, “age, the greatest risk factor for dementia overall, is unmodifiable.” Even so, Livingston added, people should think about finding ways to cut their dementia risk, and policymakers should think about creating environments that promote health. For example, some communities aren’t walkable, or lack strong tobacco control policies. Making exercise more accessible, and helping people quit their smoking habit, could reduce the dementia burden. Considering what a costly and devastating problem dementia is, we can’t wait for better evidence. And, it seems, even small steps toward living a healthier and more active lifestyle not only boost your overall health, but the health of your brain, too.",https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/7/31/16049300/dementia-alzheimers-prevention,,Vox
118,118,17-06-16 18:40,2016,6,17,Emily Crockett,"After the killing of a British MP, it’s time to admit violence has a misogyny problem","The United Kingdom is reeling from the news that Jo Cox, a Labour Party member of Parliament, was fatally shot and stabbed on Thursday. It’s a horrific act of violence in an already-horrific week of violence following the Orlando shooting in the US. In the wake of the killing, this tweet clearly struck a nerve and was widely shared: Female MPs get daily death and rape threats: ""It's just online, why can't you ignore it?"". Female MP is murdered: ""An unexpected tragedy."" We don’t yet know the assassin’s motivation. Suspect Thomas Mair has been linked to a US-based Neo-Nazi group, the National Alliance. There are unconfirmed reports that Mair shouted ""Britain first!"" before attacking Cox, a reference to the hotly debated ""Brexit"" referendum on whether Great Britain should leave the European Union, which Cox vocally opposed. Cox was also a strong supporter of helping Syrian refugees. Officials are also investigating National Action, a white supremacist group that has campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union. ""It’s an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday; it’s the well of hatred that killed her,"" said Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. But whatever the killer’s specific motivations, Beth Murray’s tweet resonated with people who take online harassment of women seriously and are frustrated that many, including law enforcement agencies, often do not. Her words also speak to the powerful role that male hatred and misogyny plays in varying degrees for women in power. Several women in Parliament have been subjected to vicious misogynistic attacks on Twitter — including one MP, Jess Phillips, who received 600 rape threats in one night. The incidents have fueled criticism that Twitter isn’t doing enough to protect users from harassment. Cox herself had experienced such harassment, and her security was reportedly increased after a three-month campaign of harassing messages against her. One man was cautioned by police for sending her ""malicious communications of a sexual nature,"" but he wasn’t the suspect. Police also said that there was no known link between the harassing messages and the attack on Cox. While police determine the killer’s possible political motivations for the attack, we shouldn’t ignore the likely role of pure hatred in it, and the role that hateful misogyny too often plays in attacks like these. In 2011, US Congress member Gabrielle Giffords was shot and nearly killed by Jared Loughner, who reportedly had sexist views and believed that women shouldn’t be in power. Giffords was Loughner’s local representative, as Cox was Mair’s. Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Lewis Dear, and numerous other men who committed lethal high-profile mass shootings were also reported to have private histories of brutal domestic violence and sexual assault. And as I reported for Vox this week, most ""mass shootings"" as typically defined by news outlets are actually domestic violence attacks, often against women or children. Every high-profile shooting has unique circumstances, and every killer has different motivations. But extreme misogyny is such a common thread in so many of them that we can no longer ignore its role in public violence. Correction: The original headline of this article referred to Cox as a British ""PM."" She was a member of Parliament, or MP — not PM, which stands for Prime Minister. We regret the error.",https://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11962932/jo-cox-british-mp-assassination-murder-misogyny-violence,,Vox
119,119,08-09-17 20:00,2017,9,8,Hilary Pollack,Emergency Services Rush to Save Expensive Wine from Hurricane Irma,"As Hurricane Irma draws closer to the Florida coast after devastating the Caribbean, where it affected more than 1.2 million people and led to at least 20 deaths, residents of the Southeastern coast of the US are frantically trying to prepare for the destruction it might bring, from leveling homes to knocking out power to thousands upon thousands of people and businesses.  But with panicked efforts underway to save families, pets, and homes, some emergency responders in Florida and Louisiana are also committed to saving an asset that some fear is particularly susceptible to damage during the storm: expensive wines.  According to Newsweek, collectors and wine suppliers are rushing to move valuable stockpiles of valuable wines out of the path of Irma, which was downgraded from Category 5 to Category 4 as of Friday afternoon and is expected to make landfall tomorrow morning. The gravest concerns for collectors are flooding, which could destroy labels and degrade corks, and power outages that could shut off fridges. Changes in temperature can even cause bottles of wine to explode under some circumstances.  Adam Gungle, the chief executive officer of a wine transportation service called Xpeditr, which specializes in protecting wine investments during natural disasters, told Reuters, ""The wrath of a hurricane can ruin delicate pieces of liquid history... Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina and Sandy ruined tens of millions of dollars worth of fine wine. A lot of these bottles survived World War I, World War II."" Some of the collections being relocated are worth millions of dollars and include bottles that are more than a century old. Gungle also noted that some of the bottles are being aged by collectors to be donated to charity.  Xpeditr founded its Emergency Response Team after Superstorm Sandy destroyed millions of dollars worth of wine when it struck the East Coast in 2012.  English billionaire and Virgin founder Richard Branson revealed today that when he found that his 74-acre private island were in the path of Hurricane Irma, he survived by holing up in his wine cellar.  As he braced for Irma's arrival last night, Branson wrote on his blog on Virgin's website, ""Knowing our wonderful team as I do, I suspect there will be little wine left in the cellar when we all emerge."" Thankfully, he, his team, and the wine all made it through the storm.  ""We took shelter from the strongest hurricane ever inside the concrete cellar on Necker and very, very fortunately it held firm,"" he wrote in a follow-up blog post today. ""I have never seen anything like this hurricane. Necker and the whole area have been completely and utterly devastated... For those who are still in the path of Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Jose to come, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to put safety first and prepare as strongly as possible. Having seen first-hand the power of this storm, please ensure you stay inside, ideally in organized shelters or other solid concrete structures with water, supplies and emergency contact plans.""

120,120,05-06-17 00:00,2017,6,5,Devon Van Houten Maldonado,An Artist Serves Up Food for Thought About Excessive Consumption,"Raúl Ortega Ayala’s new exhibition at Proyectos Monclova includes a buffet based on a historical image of the restaurant atop the World Trade Center and a model of the Tower of Babel sculpted out of lard. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads MEXICO CITY — A scene from a grotesque flesh ritual is acted out in the main gallery of Raúl Ortega Ayala’s Food for Thought, a show revealing humanity’s incredible capacity to consume. It might ruin your appetite, but beneath the drama there are layers of subtlety and nuance in the video works and installation. The works, which span the top floor and the basement galleries of Proyectos Monclova, are part of the same series but comprise distinct projects dealing with consumption and food in two different ways. The artist connects consumption habits to ceremony, debauchery, and the decline of society. The video works on the top floor deal directly with food culture through a style of artistic-anthropological study, which marks the culmination of three years of research for Ortega Ayala. Three videos are accompanied by two small paintings tucked into the corners of the installation, leaving the main gallery mostly dark. Amid the darkness, three warm floodlights illuminate “Babel Fat Tower” (2010), a contemporary nod to Pieter Bruegel’s masterpiece. An actual tower of lard, the sculpture emits a subtle stench as the lights heat the glistening pile, which is intended to melt down over the course of the exhibition. The metaphor isn’t exactly subtle, but the stinking pile loans a meaty materiality to the cold video installation nearby. Alongside the large video projections, the small paintings don’t call attention to themselves. They are inspired by foie gras and stuffed pig, except that the overfed animals in these images are represented by human hands making shadow puppets, and they allude to another motif that echoes throughout the show — the performance of food. They also reveal the painter in Ortega Ayala. This painterliness reemerges in the videos, where the artist frames human figures in compositions reminiscent of a Rembrandt, emphasizing the fleshy body and packing the frame with a tangle of limbs and saturated colors. The pair of projections in the main gallery space make up the two-channel video work, “Tomatina-Tim” (2016). On one screen, Ortega Ayala films the annual La Tomatina festival in Buñol, Spain from above, its many participants dissolving into a sweaty mass of bodies covered in blood-red tomato juice and flesh. Despite the festive atmosphere and the zealous roar of a thousand drunken bros, the drama turns dark and sad when the tomatoes run out and the crowd disperses, leaving people strewn about, sitting or lying in the wet trash. The noise of the crowd dies down and a woman’s scream is identifiable amid the din. Then we see her on the screen, surrounded by a throng of shirtless men trying to rip her shirt off — apparently part of the tradition of the festival, as seen during the peak of the tomato mashing madness, but the assault and the woman’s desperation are palpable. On the opposite screen, a hotdog-eating champion and professional gurgitator named Tim sits down casually to a pile of a few dozen hotdogs at the famous restaurant Nathan’s, smashing them into his mouth two at a time and soaking the buns in water so that they slide down his throat more easily. This training routine of excess epitomizes something pathological in our culture of consumption, where satiation is never possible. Part of Ortega Ayala’s intention is to underline the ridiculous pointlessness of these ceremonies, whose only purposes are indulging gluttony and celebrating excess — how appropriately and sickeningly poignant. The festival of debauchery and wasted food in Spain bears the markings of an ancient pagan fertility ritual, but there is no higher meaning here, as Kim Córdova points out in the exhibition text. Are there traditions of excess, or does gluttony itself fill the void left by a lack of tradition? Another video on view, “Untitled (Cheese Rolling)” (2017), documents the flailing, tumbling, tangled participants of the now world-famous festival in Gloucestershire, England, where participants race down a steep hill in pursuit of a tumbling wheel of cheese, resulting in a variety of totally avoidable blunt trauma injuries. The slow motion video shows the martyrdom of the townspeople willing to sacrifice themselves in the name of decontextualized tradition. There is a deeper metaphor about ‘biting the hand that feeds you’ suggested by Ortega Ayala’s work downstairs. In the main gallery, a very strange scene awaits. A feast has been prepared, based on a vintage image of a buffet at the Windows on the World restaurant, which served clients atop the North Tower of the original World Trade Center. This powerful evocation of September 11 gave way to a shared meal during the exhibition opening, the spread surrounded by vitrines of images and newspaper clippings documenting the cleanup of the collapsed skyscrapers. The meal’s moldy leftovers remain on display in the gallery. In the vitrines, Ortega Ayala traces the material of the felled towers to companies in India and China, which purchased the twisted metal as scrap steel in order to make new buildings, housewares, or maybe even weapons. The common practice of recycling scrap steel is suddenly complicated by tragedy and the enormous, all-encompassing cycle of destruction and construction. In Food for Thought, Ortega Ayala attempts to connect modern practices of gluttony with their possible origins in tradition or ritual, but the result is an expression of some primitive desire of the flesh to get drunk and dirty. The image of the mythical tower turned into an homage to lard alludes to our corrupted best intentions to reach toward the heavens. The artist portrays modernity, through the recycling of an unimaginably destructive tragedy, as the evolution of our attempts to clean up the mess from the trial and error of building (and rebuilding) civilization. Raul Ortega Ayala: Food for Thought continues at Proyectos Monclova (Colima 55, Roma Norte, Mexico City) through June 10.",https://hyperallergic.com/383073/an-artist-serves-up-food-for-thought-about-excessive-consumption/,,Hyperallergic

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Today, Hyperallergic confirmed that the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York “does not plan to accept any gifts” from the Sackler family, the controversial owners of Purdue Pharma. The family and drug manufacturer have been accused of misleading medical professionals on the gravity of the drug OxyContin, and are currently the targets of lawsuits on behalf of the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Yesterday, Tate’s board of trustees announced that the museum will no longer accept funds from the Sackler family. In the New York Times’s coverage of the unprecedented decision, the Guggenheim was cited saying that “no contributions from the Sackler family have been received since 2015 and no additional gifts are planned.” Today, the Guggenheim confirmed with Hyperallergic: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum received a total of $7 million in gifts from members of the Mortimer D. Sackler family initiated in 1995 and paid out through 2006 to establish and support the Sackler Center for Arts Education, which serves approximately 300,000 youth, adults, and families each year. An additional $2 million was received between 1999 and 2015 to support the museum. No contributions from the Sackler family have been received since 2015. No additional gifts are planned, and the Guggenheim does not plan to accept any gifts. Earlier this week, London’s National Portrait Gallery decided to not accept a donation of £1 million (~$1.3 million) from the Sackler Trust. This morning, The Art Newspaper revealed that last year a South London Gallery returned a £125,000 (~$165,000) donation from the Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, gifted to build an education center in 2014. These institutional changes follow widespread protests from drug policy advocates including photographer Nan Goldin, best known for her series The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.  In 2017, Goldin founded PAIN Sackler, a drug advocacy organization that demands “all museums, universities, and educational institutions worldwide remove Sackler signage and publicly refuse future funding from the Sacklers.” In February, PAIN Sackler held a die-in at the Guggenheim and then marched to the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a large protest of the Sacklers’s major influence as art philanthropists. In January 2019, Daniel H. Weiss, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum said the institution “is currently engaging in a further review of our detailed gift acceptance policies, and we will have more to report in due course.” Today, the museum informed Hyperallergic that the institution does not yet have an updated statement regarding this review. Editors note 3/25/19: The Metropolitan Museum of Art has sent Hyperallergic an updated statement on behalf of Daniel Weiss, stating: The issue of Sackler funding reflects a complexity that is common in this area. The Sacklers began supporting The Met over 50 years ago – decades before the invention of opioids and the public health crisis that has later ensued. The contemporary Sackler family is large and there are varying relationships among these branches with Purdue Pharma (some have had no relationship with the company for decades). Incidentally, the Museum has not received gifts from the Sackler family over the past two years. All of this demonstrates the need for the Museum’s leadership team to be highly deliberative. We will continue our review of the Museum’s gift acceptance policies, will adjust wherever necessary, and will be transparent in our process and conclusions.",https://hyperallergic.com/491320/guggenheim-museum-does-not-plan-to-accept-any-gifts-from-the-sackler-family/,,Hyperallergic
122,122,26-08-16 16:43,2016,8,26,UK Sports Staff,Never Mind The Polloks: Vice Sports Goals of the Week,"This article originally appeared on VICE Sports UK. It's that time of the week again, when we feast upon a veritable banquet of goals. We have fasted for hours on end in preparation, and we're now ready to gorge ourselves on the most exquisite delicacies that the last few days have to offer. When it comes to excellent finishing, we are vile gluttons, happy to stuff our bellies full of goals until we are groaning and swollen, acutely nauseous with the indulgence of it all. We want goals filling our stomachs, goals dancing across our taste buds, goals running out of the corner of our mouths and down our quivering, multiple chins. Here are the tastiest goals from the past week, then. Gobble them down, like the sickening gourmands you are. Hanlon's goals come at 0:05, 1:15 and 2:25 In all our time writing this column, we have never featured a team from the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division. That's because, generally speaking, football at that level is absolute shite. Once in a while, however, even a Scottish non-league side can produce a moment of sheer brilliance. In this case, there have been three in one game, all coming from a lad named Tam Hanlon. Playing for Glaswegian side FC Pollok in their Sectional League Cup match against Neilston, Hanlon managed to score a sublime hat-trick from the right-back position. First, he fired in a sweet free kick with his left foot. Then, he thumped a long-range howitzer into the top corner. While that was probably the pick of the bunch, he went on to complete his three-goal haul with another free kick, this time tucking home with his right. To repeat: FC Pollok play in the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division. This was a fucking miracle, quite frankly. Now, we know what you're going to say here. You're going to say that the assist for this goal wasn't deliberate, and that the whole thing was a comedy of errors precipitated by a capricious breeze. In the absence of definitive proof, however, we're going to give Thamesmead Town the benefit of the doubt. That being the case, we maintain that this is one of the greatest build-ups to a goal we've ever seen. With Thamesmead taking on Guernsey in the preliminary rounds of the FA Cup, Scott Kinch completely fucked up a shot played a sublime, curving ball into the box. We have never seen a pass get caught up in a gust of wind defy the laws of physics in quite such a miraculous fashion, having been mishit so badly hit with such finesse that it bent back in on itself and landed right in the middle of the box. From there, Thamesmead's Jack Mahoney managed an excellent improvised finish, using complete dumb luck magnificent skill to bundle home lob the keeper from close range. This was not a goal, this was art. In the late nineteenth century, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were a group of mystics and occultists. They studied all things paranormal, and tried to explain phenomena which conventional wisdom could not explain. Even they would have struggled to get their heads around this goal from Shaun Williams, because it's absolutely twatting magical. Devoted to the study of this magnificent goal, we now inaugurate the Hermetic Order of the Golden Shaun.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgnaxz/never-mind-the-polloks-vice-sports-goals-of-the-week,Sports,Vice

Stock for Snap, the company behind Snapchat, fell more than 12 percent Monday, just its third full day of trading. Snap stock finished the day at $23.77 per share, below the $24 opening price it garnered on IPO day last week. The dip appears to be tied to a number of poor analyst ratings, including five “sell” ratings, which is an unusually high number. The biggest concern around Snapchat appears to be tied to user growth. Snap has 158 million daily users but added just five million new users in Q4, a hefty decline from earlier in the year. Of course, Snap is far from doomed just three days into trading — the stock is simply settling after a crazy IPO rush. On IPO day last Thursday, the stock finished the day up 44 percent.

128,128,27-11-17 16:20,2017,11,27,Julia Azari,Depicting Nazis as ordinary gives them power,"This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. A New York Times profile of a cat-loving Nazi and his wife has awoken the anger of the internet. It’s not that this is difficult to do, and the danger of responding to problematic viral articles is that it’s easy to pick apart what’s wrong with such pieces, and often much harder to assess the context in which the idea came about in the first place. There’s been some effort at this in the Twitter conversation, especially with a focus on the lack of racial diversity in newsrooms. Aspects of the news business certainly have something to do with misfires like fluff profiles of violent racists — at the very least, they create an environment where this kind of thing is possible. But the news media doesn’t exist in a vacuum. How to deal with the presence of terrible and destructive ideas in a modern and open society is an ongoing question, and it’s an especially pressing one right now. The place to start with this dilemma is how we think about free speech and the marketplace of ideas — necessities for a free society that pose a real dilemma when it comes to dealing with anti-democratic ideas. People often learn to understand the broad scope of free speech in the US through examples like Larry Flynt, the notorious editor of Hustler magazine, or Nazis marching through Skokie, Illinois, defended in court by the American Civil Liberties Union. These cases, especially when paired with everyone’s favorite decontextualized Voltaire quote, suggest that freedom of speech is primarily about offense and tolerance. But when we think of it primarily in terms of unpopular groups — Nazis, atheists, communists — and in terms of the offense it might cause people, we remove speech, expression, and the associated freedoms protected by the First Amendment from their historical context. Freedom of expression is not just about pushing the boundaries of social acceptability. It is about the ability to challenge power — most literally, to criticize the government without fear of legal consequences. Obviously, ideas about free expression — including the right to hold and express hideous views — have evolved a great deal. These ideas were developed in a world in which political speech was costly. In the United States, we now practice them in a world in which political speech is cheap. This state of affairs makes it easy to obscure the power dynamics involved in some forms of offensive or challenging speech. Our highly limited discourse on the topic means that Nazis and white supremacists are put in the same category with sacrilegious art exhibits and provocateurs like Flynt. Using this framework limits how we can think about what to do with ideas like white supremacy and white nationalism. Thinking about these ideas as merely offensive and marginal ignores a simple and uncomfortable truth. One of the reasons we draw bright boundaries around racist thinking is not because it’s odious and beyond the pale, but because it’s odious and has proven over again to be incredibly potent in the right circumstances. In the US, a history of overt discrimination is still built into many of our institutions. People who fought actual Nazis in Europe are still alive. While Americans mostly use social sanctioning and norms, some societies have responded to these kinds of threats by enacting legal bans on certain types of speech. (Like many Americans, I would oppose legal measures. But I support your right to favor them.) The offending Times profile comes out of a few related developments. The marginalization of violent racism may have become a victim of its own success; as with other surprising political developments of the past few years, it tends to be treated as fundamentally unserious, an approach whose lack of viability is immediately obvious. This makes extremists like the ones profiled in the Times piece seem like curiosities, like people who have weird hobbies. Such thinking no longer makes sense. We now know that the belief in such natural boundaries is a delusion. At the same time, American society seems to be experiencing a moment in which there is a serious debate about who does and does not have power. An entire genre of books and articles about the white working class chronicles its powerlessness in a culture that (at least superficially) prizes education and diversity. The election of the first black president unsettled centuries of racial hierarchy. In other words, there’s a potent and omnipresent cultural narrative of — for lack of a less blunt phrase — white victimhood. When we take complaints about “PC culture” or “identity politics” at face value, we open up space for grievances about “white interests,” whether we want to or not. For years, fringe groups have embraced these victimhood ideas, and now those ideas are part of the mainstream discourse — despite the many documented disadvantages experienced by women and racial minorities. At the intersection of novelty and victimhood, we find stories of Nazis going to Panera, their ideas largely stripped of history and context. Much has been said about the “normalization” of such ideas — that by portraying Nazis as average, even sympathetic, people, journalists run the risk of helping to integrate violent ideologies into the mainstream. The thing is that violent, racist ideologies have spent lots of time in the mainstream. They’ve proven very destructive. The imperative of the moment is not just to debate about how to keep them at the margins, but to remember out loud why they belong there. The danger, then, in an everyday portrait of the white supremacist next door isn’t in the normalization but in the populist ideology that’s buried deep in the narrative. Depictions of ordinary, small, powerless American life have proven an immensely useful political tool at times. These depictions have provided a packaging for executive power, a way to delegitimize war protests, and, of course, a justification for racism. Reducing a white supremacist to the features of his harmless life obscures the horror his ideas can unleash.",https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2017/11/27/16703106/new-york-times-nazis-free-speech,,Vox

Christie’s will sell two early paintings by Tony O’Malley, which, when turned over and placed side by side, reveal an unfinished nude by Francis Bacon. The two artists were neighbors in St. Ives in the late 1950s. O’Malley cut the board that Bacon had used in half in order to produce “Currach, Clare Island” and “Evening Landscape Tehidy Hospital.” The paintings are estimated to fetch between £20,000–30,000 (~$) at Christie’s Modern British and Irish Art sale on March 17.

According to Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the State Hermitage Museum, the British Museum purposely avoided shipping its recent loan of one of the Parthenon sculptures through Europe. “Greece believe that it belongs to them and they could have attempted to seize it at some airport en route,” Piotrovsky told The Art Newspaper. The Walker Art Center will no longer host its wildly popular Internet Cat Video Festival. The museum will donate memorabilia from the festival’s four iterations to the Minnesota Historical Society. A Brief Flowering, an exhibition of works by Welsh artist John Cyrlas Williams (1902–65), will open at the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw on March 20. In 2004, over 150 of Williams’ works were discovered in the attic of his family home in Porthcawl. Art historian Peter Lord told the BBC that the trove of artworks narrowly avoided destruction. “It turns out that the auctioneers had been clearing the house prior to sale, and that they were about to throw the whole lot on a bonfire in the back garden,” Lord told the BBC.

130,130,17-12-18 14:00,2018,12,17,Ezra Klein,Medicare-for-all will be shaped by these 3 questions,"If you haven’t read Sarah Kliff and Dylan Scott’s rundown of the various Democratic plans for expanding health care, most of which build on either Medicare or Medicaid, you should. I’ll wait. The policy questions here are profound, but a lesson of past health care reform efforts is that the policy is shaped by the politics. Three political questions, in particular, will shape both the design and the viability of whatever Democrats come up with. Those three questions are: This doesn’t get mentioned much, but it’s perhaps the most important question Democrats will face. The central lesson of both Obamacare and the efforts to repeal it is that getting 60 votes for health care reform is almost impossible. In Obamacare’s case, the filibuster meant Democrats needed to win every single one of their 60 members, which meant every single Senate Democrat held a veto on the bill. Absent the filibuster, the Affordable Care Act could’ve been substantially more generous, and substantially more ambitious. Sen. Joe Lieberman, for instance, vowed to kill the bill unless both the public option and a proposal to open Medicare to 55-year-olds were axed. If Democrats could’ve passed the bill with 51 votes, they could’ve told Lieberman to take a hike. “The big challenge that we faced was the filibuster,” Barack Obama said in 2018. “And it’s a weird thing because it’s not something that the average American spends a lot of time thinking about.” In the GOP repeal effort’s case, it meant that the plans had to run through the narrow budget reconciliation process, a loophole meant to speed budget fixes past the filibuster, but that requires every single provision to directly change spending or taxes. As a result, the GOP’s plans were poorly constructed and often didn’t go nearly as far as Republicans wanted. President Donald Trump isn’t exactly a master of parliamentary procedure, but he quickly realized that the filibuster was the key obstacle. “The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes,” he tweeted. “Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!” A bare majority in the Senate will be hard even if Democrats pull a good hand in 2020. But there’s no path to a 60-vote Democratic supermajority. And while it’s possible to imagine a Medicare-for-more bill making it through budget reconciliation, if Democrats want to do something as complex as reconstructing the American health care system, they’re going to need to be able to write legislation in a simple, straightforward way. That means that Democrats either need to get rid of the filibuster, which they can do with 51 votes, or they need to repeatedly overrule parliamentary challenges to their reconciliation bill, which is pretty much the same thing. Either strategy will be a tough sell: Senate Democrats have rediscovered their affection for the filibuster in the Trump era; even Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he regrets weakening the rule in 2013. The upside of replacing private insurance with a single-payer system, as both Bernie Sanders’s and the House Progressives’ plans do, is that the system becomes a lot simpler and a lot cheaper, as the government can use its monopsony buying power to force down prices. The downside is most people like the insurance they have, and being told that their insurance will be canceled and replaced with a government plan could unleash a backlash that annihilates the entire plan. Remember the fiasco around President Obama’s “if you like your health insurance, you can keep it”? That was more than roughly 3 million plan cancellations, and most of the plans were cut because of how sparse their coverage was. A true single-payer system, one that replaced the existing system, would mean canceling more than 150 million insurance plans, including many high-quality employer-based plans that people love. In that respect, the more ambitious Medicare-for-all proposals go quite a bit further than the current Medicare program, where about a third of enrollees are actually on private insurance. Vox’s Scott gets at the political dangers here in his piece on the difficulties the employer-based health system poses for reformers: When Vox conducted focus groups on single-payer, led by opinion researcher Michael Perry, one recurring concern we heard was from people who mostly like the insurance they have and were worried about losing it under Medicare-for-all. “I wouldn’t like that,” Richard M., a federal official who gets his insurance through his work, said when told he would have to give up his insurance. “I like having an option. And I mean at this stage, I’m working full time, I should have an option.” The polling bears out this sentiment: 83 percent of people with employer-sponsored insurance said in March 2016 that they thought their health insurance was excellent or good, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. It’s hard to imagine a Democratic White House convincing vulnerable House and Senate members to reap that whirlwind. But if they don’t do it, it’s harder — though not impossible — to get to both true universality and deep cost savings. From the beginning, the Obama administration insisted the Affordable Care Act pay for itself with tax increases and Medicare cuts. This was partly principle — the White House’s concerns about long-term debt ran deep, and Peter Orszag, the budget director, was one of the law’s key architects — and partly politics: Budget neutrality was a condition of support for many of the conservative Democrats the legislation needed to win over in Congress. That decision limited the bill’s generosity and opened up devastating lines of attack that Republicans used, cynically but effectively, to portray themselves as defenders of Medicare in 2010. A lot of liberals look back on this as Obamacare’s original sin — and after watching Republicans pass tax cuts that, once again, added trillions to the national debt, they feel like suckers for dutifully balancing Obamacare’s books. The big question Democrats face next time is less how to pay for their health care plans than whether to pay for them. If they decide to fully pay for their plans, then their plans will have to be a lot less generous and there’ll be a lot more losers from the necessary tax hikes and spending cuts. As of now, the early signs are that Democrats want to hold to their old standards: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will abide by the PAYGO rule, which requires both spending cuts and tax increases to be paid for, in the House. I wrote on Friday about how the continued Republican assault on Obamacare has ensured health care remains a central issue for Democrats, and how the nature of the legal assault on Obamacare has pushed Democrats toward Medicare-for-all as an answer. But there’s a reason that, prior to Obama, president after president failed to pass health care reform. To overhaul something as important to people’s lives as the health care system, you need the trust of the public; the votes in Congress; and, if you’re paying for the plan, a whole lot of money. It’s easy to look back on the places Obamacare fell short and imagine how the law could have been more ambitious or more generous, but the compromises written into the Affordable Care Act were written for a reason: The politics of health care reform are hellish, and the modal outcome is failure. Right now, Democrats are in the minority, and so their policy proposals can exist in a pure state. But when they get power, the policy choices they actually make will depend on the political framework they choose. As such, while “Would you get rid of the filibuster?” and “Will you keep PAYGO?” may not sound like health policy questions, they very much are. Indeed, they may be the most important health policy questions.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/17/18141464/medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders-house-democrats-filibuster-taxes,,Vox
131,131,02-03-16 18:30,2016,3,2,Jeff Stein,Bernie Sanders’s path to the nomination is getting very narrow,"The Democratic nomination is now Hillary Clinton's to lose. Bernie Sanders still has time to mount an improbable comeback. But, barring any political earthquakes, Clinton's sizable delegate lead and broad coalition make it difficult to imagine how Sanders can pull off an upset, according to close trackers of the race. ""Clinton has been the huge favorite this whole time and continues to be,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""I don't see how Sanders catches up to her."" On Super Tuesday, Clinton surged ahead of Sanders by the metric that matters most: delegates. She racked up 505 delegates in winning seven of 11 states, compared with the 334 delegates Sanders took in winning four states, according to an analysis by Richard Berg-Andersson, a researcher who tracks Democratic delegate math at the Green Papers. (Some districts remained too close to call as of Wednesday morning.) ""Clinton had the night she needed to have,"" Berg-Andersson said. ""She's now well on her way to winning the nomination."" <!-- new pym.Parent('presidential-primaries-delegate-tracker-2016__graphic-dem-delegate-tracker', 'http://www.vox.com/a/presidential-primary-delegate-tracker/dem-delegate-tracker-index', {xdomain: '.*\.vox\.com'}); // --> Clinton now leads Sanders by around 200 pledged delegates — in large part because of her big wins across many Southern states on Tuesday. It's tough to see how Sanders closes that gap, even if he runs more or less evenly with her the rest of the race. That's in part because the Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally, meaning candidates need to win the popular vote by big margins to make up a delegate deficit. Beyond the delegate math, Super Tuesday provided several other reasons to doubt that Sanders could seriously threaten Clinton for the nomination. Perhaps the biggest reason is that Clinton has continued to clobber Sanders among African-American voters, and not just in the Deep South. She won a massive 93 percent of the black vote in Alabama, for instance, but also won black voters in Oklahoma, Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee by huge margins. There had been some speculation that Sanders had closed the gap with Hispanic voters in Nevada. But as FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten notes, Clinton won Hispanic voters by around 42 points in Texas — suggesting Florida and New Mexico will also be favorable terrain for the former secretary of state. Then there was also evidence that Sanders's appeal is limited even among white voters. Sanders lost Massachusetts, even though white people made up 86 percent of the electorate; he also lost the white vote in Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, and Virginia, according to NBC News's exit polls. The problem for Sanders isn't just that Clinton swept the Southern states. It's also that she's likely run well ahead of him in primaries with big Democratic establishments that loom large on the calendar. ""I think Massachusetts was the most telling win of the night,"" said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow and director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. ""In a place that's in Bernie Sanders's backyard and known for its liberalism, she still won."" Clinton's strength in Massachusetts, which she won narrowly, probably reflects her strength in states with strong Democratic institutions. And that suggests she'll have a huge advantage when the contest reaches delegate-rich states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New York. ""Those are areas with large African-American populations and an established Democratic Party organization that will be very Hillary-friendly,"" Berg-Andersson said. ""Sanders is not going to get delegate boosts from those states."" By contrast, the kinds of states where Sanders has done well don't tend to have that many delegates. A big piece of Sanders's coalition has been downscale white voters, who helped him win Oklahoma by 10 points on Tuesday. But while there are many states that fit this demographic makeup, most of them just aren't very big and don't have that many delegates. (Added up, the Sanders-friendly states like Kansas, Nebraska, Idaho, Wyoming, and Oregon have around the same number of delegates as Clinton-friendly Illinois.) None of this is to say that Sanders is certainly done. Sanders's campaign argued on Wednesday that Sanders has a viable path to the nomination that runs through industrial Midwestern states battered by the recession, according to the Washington Post. That strategy would make the March 8 primary in Michigan, which has 147 delegates, a crucial battleground for Sanders. ""We still think we have a winning hand in this game, and we’re going to continue to play it,"" said Tad Devine, a Sanders aide, according to the Washington Post. But with Clinton leading by double digits in several recent national polls, Sanders will have to change something — and do it fast — to alter the fundamentals of the race. ""[Clinton] has a substantial lead, a substantial delegate lead, and a great deal of momentum,"" Kamarck said. ""I suspect she's going to win. But it's not impossible for him to come back.""",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/2/11146946/bernie-sanders-clinton,,Vox
132,132,21-06-19 00:00,2019,6,21,Pete Schroeder,U.S. banks clear first hurdle of Federal Reserve's annual stress test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 18 largest banks operating in the United States took the first step toward doling out capital on dividends, share buybacks and other investments on Friday, after clearing the first stage of their yearly health checks with the U.S. Federal Reserve that assess their ability to weather a major economic downturn.  The central bank said lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp, would face losses of $410 billion under its most severe recession scenario ever, but levels of high-quality capital would still be well above regulatory minimums.  “The nation’s largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well-positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock,” Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said in a statement.  The Fed said hypothetical losses were broadly comparable to results from prior years, with the most significant loan losses seen in credit cards, followed by commercial and industrial loans.  Friday’s results, the first of the two-part annual “stress test,” showed the country’s biggest lenders could meet minimum Fed standards based on information they submitted to the regulator.  But banks could still stumble next Thursday, when the Fed announces whether it will permit banks to dish out dividends and buy back shares. That second test is more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans. It also reviews operational controls and risk management.   All eyes are on Deutsche Bank, which is bracing for potentially its fourth flunking in five years amid ongoing turmoil in its U.S. operations, Reuters reported on Thursday. Last year, the Fed failed the bank, citing “material weaknesses” in its data capabilities and capital planning.   The Fed created the stress tests during the 2007-2009 financial crisis to ensure banks are strong enough to continue lending through a severe economic downturn.  This year’s tests are more streamlined following a Fed review of the process, which has long been hated by the industry. Roughly half as many banks were tested this year compared to 2018 after the Fed earlier this year moved several smaller firms onto a two-year testing cycle.  The 18 banks tested this year hold roughly 70 percent of all U.S. bank assets, according to the Fed.  In addition, most banks can no longer fail on “qualitative” grounds. Previously, banks that had sufficient capital could still be flunked if the Fed identified risk management and operational problems.  In March, the Fed said it was dropping this qualitative objection for domestic U.S. banks. Only the U.S. subsidiaries of five foreign lenders — Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG, UBS Group AG, Barclays Plc and TD Bank — must clear that hurdle this year.  Since the first test in 2009, banks have seen losses shrink, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The largest banks have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $680 billion in top-tier capital, the Fed said.  This year’s recession scenario included a jump to 10 percent unemployment, as well as elevated stress in corporate loan markets and falling real estate prices. However, the Fed also this year gave banks more information about the testing models, after years of industry gripes that the process is too opaque.

In December 2015, sales grew five and a half times from the previous year, according to NPD Group’s Retail Tracking Service, and in March the FAA released predictions that drone sales would reach 2.5 million annually by the end of 2016. One of the most anticipated drones this year, the foldable Mavic Pro from industry leader DJI, was in such high demand the China-based company has been struggling to get its drones out the door by its expected shipping dates. DJI chalked the setback up to a problem with one of the parts in the manufacturing process; the Mavic has been shipping preorders, albeit slower than anticipated. Now, if you want a Mavic Pro you can order one, but according to the company website, you’re unlikely to get it until mid-January, so not in time for holiday gift giving. DJI did manage to get one to Recode, though. The Mavic is branded as a kind of personal drone that’s good for beginners. It’s small enough to fit in a backpack (it folds into the size of a water bottle) and can actually follow you (or a dog or your friend) around thanks to its onboard artifical intellegence.

135,135,24-03-19 00:00,2019,3,24,Lewis Krauskopf,"U.S. Treasury yields hit lowest since late 2017, global stocks fall","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasury debt yields fell to their lowest since late 2017 on Monday and a gauge of world stocks dropped for a second straight session on persistent concerns over global economic growth.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below 2.4 percent for the first time since December 2017. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield slid back into negative territory.   MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.46 percent, after it posted on Friday its biggest one-day drop in about three months. Wall Street’s main indexes ended little changed during a choppy session after falling sharply on Friday.  Investors were still digesting weak U.S. factory data last week that prompted an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is widely seen as an indicator of an economic recession.  “The big story is bond yields,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.   “You are at a point now where a drop in yields isn’t being perceived as being a good thing for stocks... The thinking is,  yields are dropping because the economy is weakening and that’s not a good thing for stocks,” Delwiche said.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.51 points, or 0.06 percent, to 25,516.83, the S&P 500 lost 2.35 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,798.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.13 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,637.54.  Apple shares fell 1.2 percent, weighing on indexes,  as the company unveiled a streaming video service.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.45 percent, its fourth straight drop.  In one economic bright spot, a survey showed German business morale improved unexpectedly in March after six consecutive drops.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.414 percent, from 2.455 percent late on Friday. The yield fell as low as 2.377 percent.  On Friday, the spread between yields on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes fell below zero for the first time since 2007. Such an inversion is a warning sign about the economy.  Investors were evaluating last week’s dovish pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve, in which the central bank stunned investors by abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year.   The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.12 percent, with the euro down 0.01 percent to $1.1311.  U.S. crude settled down 0.4 percent at $58.82 a barrel, while Brent settled at $67.21, up 0.3 percent  on the day.  Gold prices rose to a more than three-week high, helped by a weaker dollar and as worries over global economic growth pushed investors into safe-haven assets.  Spot gold added 0.7 percent to $1,322.21 an ounce.

136,136,15-02-16 18:50,2016,2,15,Arik Hesseldahl,Global Chip Industry Readies for a Future Beyond Moore's Law,"It hasn’t even been a year since the world’s technology elite paused to observe the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law, and the long knives are already out in force to deny it a 51st. Next month the global semiconductor industry will release its latest biennial assessment of the technological road ahead for making computer chips. As reported by the journal Nature, for the first time, the look ahead will be crafted without the key assumption of the “law,” central in all previous reports: That chipmaking technology will improve sufficiently that companies at the forefront of the business will be able to shrink the size of transistors every two years or so at a more-or-less predictable pace. The new forecast, called the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, is an evolution of what has since 1998 been called the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. For the first time, its outlook will be based less on the view that applications will inevitably follow improvements in raw computing speed and power, but instead that chip advances will be developed with applications in mind: Smartphones, wearable devices and machines running in data centers and so on. Moore’s Law will no longer be considered central to the roadmap. Moore’s Law isn’t really a law of science, but rather an informal observation made about the apparent progress of what was in 1965 a very young chip industry. That year Gordon Moore — who later co-founded Intel — wrote up his thoughts in a paper for the April 1965 edition of Electronics Magazine. He proved remarkably prescient, suggesting that by 1975 a single chip could contain a then-unimaginable 75,000 transistors. The transistor counts of today’s mainstream chips number in the billions. Practically every form of computing and electronics has derived a direct benefit from the unremitting efforts of semiconductor engineers who have repeatedly scaled seemingly impassable barriers in the electrical and materials sciences. The advances have had a monumental long-term effect on society’s ability to process information and to make it faster and easier to access: Every new generation of chip is smaller than and at least as powerful a computing engine as the one that came before it, but less expensive to make. Until now, practically every time doubting wags, including myself, have argued that the time had come for Moore and his law to ride off into the sunset, the engineers in bunny suits have figured out new ways to maintain control of the electrons flowing on a chip. This time is different. As I argued in an essay for Re/code last year, the chip industry is running up against some truly fundamental limits that are causing a lot of people who know a lot more about this than I do to conclude that the time has come to reconsider how we think about improvements in computing. It comes down to this: You can only shrink a chip so much before the physics fails. The most advanced chip currently turned out by Intel is built on a 14-nanometer process technology. A nanometer is a billionth a meter, and the period at the end of this sentence, were it printed on paper, would be about one million nanometers. At 14 nanometers, the individual parts that make up that chip are smaller than a typical virus particle and similar in size to the outer cell wall of an individual germ. It has gotten so expensive and complicated to manufacture at this scale that only four companies are considered to be on today’s leading edge, down from 18 a decade ago: Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and GlobalFoundries. The next logical steps in the semiconductor roadmap take us to 10 nanometers, which, depending on whom you ask, may appear in commercial chips this year. Beyond that lies seven nanometers — due about 2018 or 2019. Intel can see ahead about that far. TSMC says it will reach seven nanometers sometime next year and is now working to get to five. Generally speaking it’s at the five-nanometer juncture — due maybe in 2021, give or take — that the outlook has tended to get incomprehensibly fuzzy. At that size, elements on the chip would be about twice the size of a strand of DNA. Smaller than that, the design features on a chip become no bigger than 10 individual atoms. At that scale, electrons start to behave unreliably: The laws of classical physics give way to the infamously uncertain rules of the quantum scale. Remember Heisenberg (and I don’t mean the one from “Breaking Bad”)? This is his territory. You might be able to make chips at that size, but there’s no guarantee they’d work. So what’s it all mean? Potentially a much more complex view of the progress of chip technology as we head into the future. As Daniel Reed, a computer scientist at the University of Iowa who was quoted in the Nature essay, says, today’s Boeing 787 doesn’t fly much faster than a Boeing 707 did in the 1970s, but a lot of other innovation has come in aircraft since then, including improved fuel efficiency, lighter airframes and electronic navigation systems. The road ahead will diverge from one into many with different destinations and different milestones along the way. Some indeed may lead nowhere, but others will lead into unexpected territory that we haven’t foreseen. I don’t know about you, but to me that seems kind of cool.

137,137,10-04-17 19:01,2017,4,10,Dara Lind,"How the outdated, nonsensical Passover rules taught me what Judaism is really about","Off and on growing up, I attempted to keep ""kosher for Passover"" — something my purely secular Jewish family didn't do. In a neighborhood where my claims to being Jewish were inherently suspect because I didn't attend a synagogue anyone recognized or go to youth group conventions and summer camps, it was something Jewish that I could actually do on my own. Or so I thought. All I knew of Passover was what I picked up from the Seder dinner we'd go to on one of the first nights of the eight-day holiday, and in attempting to deepen my observance I simply tried to logic my way out from there. Matzah is part of Passover because, in the Passover story, the Hebrew slaves fleeing Egypt didn't have time to let bread rise; so keeping kosher for Passover meant no leavened bread (or baked goods generally), I figured. I did not know the half of it. As I gradually figured out, somehow, over the course of several abashed rounds of Googling over several years, the actual rules for keeping kosher for Passover aren't about leavening (yeast). They restrict any use of the ""five grains"" — wheat, spelt (whatever spelt is), barley, oats and rye — that start to ""rise"" (i.e., ferment) on their own when put in contact with water. The chemistry, and logic, are beside the point. For Ashkenazi Jews — the Jews of Eastern Europe, the heritage of my father and that of many American Jews — the rules have historically gone further. Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally had to avoid corn, rice, peas, beans, peanuts, soybeans, chickpeas — all categorized under the catchall term of kitniyot. But the rules of kitniyot are falling out of fashion. In 2015, the Conservative Movement — the institution regulating the second-most-observant of Judaism's three main branches — issued a ruling to conservative Jews saying they could eat kitniyot during Passover if they wanted to. This Passover, many of them will — not to mention less-observant Ashkenazi Jews who didn't need a group of conservative rabbis to tell them not to follow rules that didn't make sense to them. I'm not exactly in the habit of listening to the Conservative Movement's rabbis myself. My Jewish practice is eclectic. Keeping kosher for Passover — no grains, and yes, no kitniyot either — is the most Jewish thing I do. Judaism is a religion of commandments. There are, famously, 613 commandments in the Torah alone (at least as counted by one of the authors of the Talmud, one of the major books of Jewish law). How Pope Francis brought me back to the Catholic Church In Hebrew, these are the mitzvot — the plural of mitzvah, which is one of those Hebrew words that's crossed into English via Yiddish. In English-via-Yiddish, a mitzvah sounds like a favor: ""It would be a mitzvah if you did the dishes after Seder."" That's because Yiddish is an irony-heavy language and American Jews are masters of the guilt trip. A mitzvah is really a commandment, just like tzedakah — often translated as ""charity"" — is really an obligation to give. My father, an atheist who taught Torah to third-graders in Sunday school, was in the habit of explaining the commandments within the context of the civilization where they'd been developed: the Fertile Crescent of thousands of years ago. Kosher dietary restrictions — the year-round kind, not the Passover kind — forbid the eating of shellfish? Think about it — shellfish can often make you sick in hot climates, especially at certain times of the year, and it was probably safer to avoid them. Judaism forbids graven images? Think about it — the earliest Jews lived among polytheistic tribes with idols for everything; worshiping only one god, a god too powerful to have a face, was certainly one way to set themselves apart. Later, as an anthropology student in college, I'd learn that this sort of thinking was called structural functionalism — the determination to see a culture as an organism, evolving in response to its environment to keep its members alive and its community cohesive — and that there were other ways to make meaning out of society. But it worked as far as it went. The problem is that some rules simply cannot be logicked. You cannot logic your way into the rules of kitniyot. Judaism is also a religion of jurisprudence. Often, that's a fancy word for arguing — one of the stories in the Haggadah, the script for the Passover Seder, ends with the so-called ""punchline"" of four rabbis being interrupted in a heated discussion by their students telling them the sun has risen and it's time for breakfast. (The real punchline is that subsequent Jewish scholars have tried to explain away the unfunniness of this joke by dissecting its symbolism in the margins of the Haggadah.) Remember, though, that the default state of Jews is diaspora: the dispersion of Jewish peoples throughout the world, and the term used for any Jew living outside of Israel (which described every Jew until the modern Israeli state was created in the late 1940s, and describes most of us today). Diaspora gave rise to the Askhenazi tradition of Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Sephardi tradition of the Mediterranean — distinctions of culture that nonetheless gave rise to certain differences of interpretation. In diaspora, jurisprudence is a crucial tool: a way for rabbis to try to make sense of new experiences and edge cases that the five books of Torah didn't cover or anticipate. Kitniyot is one of these diasporic improvisations. It's a catchall term for other foods that are prohibited during Passover according to Ashkenazi custom. This includes grains that hadn't been native to the Jews of Egypt or their descendants, like corn and rice (though quinoa, a more recent discovery, may or may not count), and any products derived from those. It also includes legumes — beans, peas, soy, peanuts, chickpeas — and the products made from those as well. (The inappropriateness of eating either peanut butter or hummus on matzah is one of the classic gripes of Passover, and is almost a reason to eat matzah the rest of the year — but not quite.) There are, in theory, reasons for this. Maybe the rabbis worried that forbidden grains would be mixed into sacks of peas or corn without anyone noticing. Maybe they were confused by the fact that beans swell when water is added to them, even though they're not fermenting. But fundamentally, trying to justify kitniyot is a fool's errand. It makes sense only as a diaspora kludge. As far as I can tell, there are four basic responses a Jew can have to an arbitrary rule. We can abide by it unquestioningly, for the simple reason that if it was good enough for our ancestors it is good enough for us. (You might be familiar with the song ""Tradition"" from the musical Fiddler on the Roof, but you might have forgotten that this too is ironic — ""Why do we do these things?"" narrator Tevye asks the audience. ""Nobody knows."") We can try to carve out exception upon exception to rule upon rule, using the law against itself. (Faced with the difficulty that multi-story apartment buildings posed to the rules against operating machines on the Sabbath, the rabbis and the engineers devised a solution: Pressing an elevator button was forbidden, but riding in an elevator programmed to stop on every floor would work.) We can kvetch about it. (Moses hears a voice from the heavens: ""Thou shalt not boil the kid in its mother's milk."" ""Aha,"" says Moses, ""you mean we can't mix milk and meat during meals!"" The voice repeats: ""Thou shalt not boil the kid in its mother's milk."" ""Aha,"" says Moses, ""we have to use separate dishes for meat and milk and wait six hours between the two!"" Etc. Finally, the voice sighs thunderously: ""Fine. Have it your way..."") Or we can simply ignore it. Among Conservative Jews (and those of us less observant still), the question is simply how many of the rules we ignore. It can be hard to grasp that the distinctions among various sects of Judaism (not to mention the wide and growing variety of Jewish practices outside established synagogues) aren't about theology but about observance: how many, and which, rules are followed. The technical term for this is orthopraxy — correct actions, as opposed to orthodoxy (correct thoughts). It's a key distinction between Judaism (and Islam, for that matter) and Christianity. Everything you need to know about Passover I grew up in Cincinnati, the home of Reform Judaism — the most relaxed of the three main branches, theologically speaking. If that seems like a welcoming place for a family who identified as Jewish (well, ish — my mother's Episcopalian) but was wholly secular, though, it wasn't quite. Our synagogue was too secular even for the Reform rabbis. I couldn't join the youth groups my classmates participated in; I didn't know things they considered preschooler-level Judaism. (I didn't know the first line of the most basic Jewish prayer until I was in middle school.) My Judaism was seen as, at best, suspect, and at worst wholly illegitimate. It wasn't until I got to college that I met a critical mass of people who identified as ""culturally Jewish,"" and felt free to do so myself without having to prove my bona fides. And it wasn't until after I graduated that I realized I didn't have to keep the ""culturally"" qualifier in front of it — that I had the power to practice Judaism actively without feeling like a fraud for not having attended the right synagogue or learned the right prayers. I owe my Judaism, as I practice it today, to a pair of dear friends I met in college. One was my roommate after graduation and lit the candles with me over Hanukkah; the other took me to High Holidays services and helped me follow along with the Hebrew. Between them, I got an adult crash course in much of what I didn't learn at secularist Sunday school. They teased me, lectured me, and always respected my choices and ideas. I love them dearly. I'm not naming them in this essay because I don't want to offend them if I've mischaracterized them in the following anecdote, but the way I remember it is too good to fact-check: I remember the two of them at a party, side by side, a Jewish two-headed monster. At the end of the day, they explained, one of them probably didn't believe in God. The other one probably did. But of all the differences in their Jewish practice, that was, they agreed, among the least important ones — because the point of their Judaism wasn't what they believed but what they did. To orthodox Jews, this is monstrous: a sickness of modernity. They can't abide the idea of Jews going through the motions to serve a deity in whom they may not believe; to them, this is precisely how Judaism gets reduced from a religion to a culture. And to many Jews who grew up being told to follow at least some of the commandments without any way of reconciling those actions with their beliefs — Jews like my father and the parents of the kids he taught at Sunday school, Jews like many of my peers — it's pointless. They find no meaning in the rituals themselves, and ""because your ancestors did it"" doesn't carry much more weight than ""because I said so."" To them, this is the religion they abandon, even if they acknowledge at least some of Jewish culture — the food, the kvetching, the Yiddish — as their own. But few people are introspective enough to know the precise origins of every trait they've inherited from their parents or been raised with in their homes. People can't always judge what, in their upbringing, was Jewish and what was not. When people slough off orthopraxy as meaningless ritual, they're putting practices and customs in a mental attic, in a box labeled ""Judaism"" — and leaving it at that. They're cutting off an alternative mode of inquiry: thinking about what they have inherited because of Judaism. The education, deliberation, and questioning inherent in the tradition of Jewish arguing and jurisprudence — these are unquestionably Jewish values. So is the commitment to social justice inherent in the obligation of tzedakah. No one would argue that these values are unique to Judaism. But their expression within Judaism is a big part of why they're so important in so many Jewish homes — and to many people who grow up in those homes. I love Pope Francis as much as the next nice Jewish girl. But I get frustrated when people who identify as cultural or secular Jews praise Pope Francis's every ambiguous, possibly-poorly-translated offhand comment to the heavens. I get frustrated when progressives with roots in Judaism spend more time litigating whether attention to poverty is a ""Christian value"" as important as preserving the 20th-century family than they do considering whether they really want progressive ""Christian values,"" or something else. I get frustrated when people label the parts of religion they find ill-fitting or antiquated as ""religion,"" and the parts of religion they're comfortable with — the economic moralizing or commitment to family — as ""values."" I get frustrated when people think of Judaism only as what's in the mental attic, rather than what's in their hearts. Look, I can't blame the Conservative Movement rabbis. I can't blame my peers who started eating kitniyot years ago, or who stop observing Passover entirely after the Seder ends. I certainly cannot throw stones here; again, I'm far more Jewish during Passover than I am during any other time of year. The reasons for getting rid of the kitniyot ban are weak. But there is no good reason to keep it. Judaism isn't ancestor-worship: It cannot be justified simply as an act of following in the footsteps of ghosts. And the fearful rush to protect Ashkenazi culture, fixating on the mortal wound it was dealt by the Nazis, runs the risk of treating it as a culture already dead and just finishing the job. But I can't help it: I worry about making Passover too easy. Maybe it's just that ""kvetching about it"" is my preferred way of responding to this particular set of illogical rules: I've managed to learn how to follow them, how hard can it be? What I suspect, though, is that I'm worried about maintaining the upside of orthopraxy: the way an action forces your attention to a thought, or a value. As a child, Passover didn't feel like freedom. It felt difficult, and self-flagellating. Freedom — I was a child — was the freedom to do whatever I liked. The Seder, of course, anticipates this. There's a point in the Passover legend where the escaped slaves, wandering in the desert, start kvetching about the food: They miss the ""fish and cucumbers"" they were fed in Egypt. The story kind of straw-mans the Hebrew slaves, but it's also a joke for present-day Jews: Slavery sucked, but it's nothing compared to eating nothing but matzah. Now I get it, though. The point of matzah isn't that eating it makes you feel free. It's asceticism and privation. It's virtue-feeling and forced humility. It's a pain in the ass; it's also a profoundly spiritual experience. I’ve spent 30 years counseling priests who fall in love. Here’s what I learned. In the context of the Seder, the attention to current injustice can be hippieish and overwhelming (not to mention hunger-dulled). But while there are only traditionally Seders for two nights, Passover lasts eight whole days. As long as you're keeping kosher for Passover — and inconvenienced enough to notice it — it's impossible to have a meal without being reminded that Passover is still going on. There are worse things than a thrice-daily reminder to be glad for freedom, and to meditate on where people still haven't been freed. People do this sort of thing all the time! We get the concept that physical actions can promote particular mental states when it's called yoga or breathing exercises. We appreciate the small reminder to be moral when it's a Fitbit or a policy ""nudge."" It is hardly as if, in an age of ethical sourcing and carbon impact, there is something alien about connecting food choices to morality. This sounds like trivializing Judaism, the faith of my ancestors, a culture that has sustained my people for thousands of years. I'd argue that even if it were trivializing, it wouldn't be any worse than simply foregoing the practice entirely and dooming it to die. But it isn't trivialization. It's orthopraxy. Judaism roots its values in obligations. You must give tzedakah. You must honor the Sabbath as a day of rest and study. You must be present in the temple on the High Holidays to seek forgiveness for the misdoings of the past year. You must, for eight days, eat matzah — ""the bread of affliction"" that is also the bread of freedom. And sure, you can put peanut butter on it. You can spend eight days eating quinoa and rice. As for me, I'd need a better reason to abandon the stricter rules about kitniyot than that following them is hard. Dara Lind is a Vox staff writer.

138,138,03-07-19 00:00,2019,7,3,"Josh Smith, Hyonhee Shin",South Korea sacks army commander over North Korea defector boat,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it sacked an army commander and rebuked other senior officers after a North Korean fishing boat piloted by defectors went undetected in South Korean waters for more than two days last month.  The incident has raised concerns about potential lapses in South Korea’s security during fragile talks to end a technical state of war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.  The small wooden boat spent more than two days in waters south of the Northern Limit Line, which separates areas controlled by the two Koreas, before docking at the port of Samcheok.  The ship’s arrival on June 15 was spotted by closed-circuit television cameras, but authorities failed to identify the vessel as North Korean, said Choi Byung-hwan, vice minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination.  The four fishermen waited, expecting to face South Korean security forces who never came. One man approached a South Korean resident and asked to use a telephone, Choi said, and police were alerted.   The commander of the South Korean Army’s 8th Corps, which oversees the area in eastern South Korea where the boat docked, was removed from his command, the defense ministry said.     The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff received a warning, and two other senior military commanders were referred to a disciplinary committee, the ministry said.  “Our analysis found that there was a failure in our security operation,” Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told reporters in the capital Seoul.  “This failure was a grave error that cannot be acceptable in any case,” he added.  Two of the fishermen said they wanted to stay in South Korea, officials said, and the other two asked to go home.  At least 546 North Koreans defected to South Korea in the first six months of this year, up from 487 in the same period last year, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday, according to Yonhap news agency.  Most North Korean escapees make their way through China and Southeast Asia, rather than attempting to cross the heavily guarded border between North and South Korea.

139,139,21-08-18 14:40,2018,8,21,Jane Coaston,"Bruce Ohr, explained","President Trump has found a new favorite Twitter target. His name is Bruce Ohr, he works in the criminal division of the Justice Department, and though you may never have heard his name, the president has tweeted about him nine times since August 11. Before Trump started tweeting, Ohr, a former associate deputy attorney general (until December 2017), was largely anonymous to the general public. But within some conservative circles, his purported involvement in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign and possible Russian interference in the 2016 election has been the stuff of a great deal of theorizing over the past few months. That theorizing has now reached Trump himself: Will Bruce Ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited Dossier, ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions “Justice” Department? A total joke! Now Ohr might lose his security clearance. He is facing a congressional hearing into what he knew about Christopher Steele and the dossier Steele helped to create. And Trump is repeatedly focusing attention on an employee within his own administration. So who exactly is Bruce Ohr, and why are he and his wife, Nellie, at the center of a firestorm that began in conservative media and has exploded onto the president’s Twitter feed? The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele’s many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC.... Bruce Ohr is a longtime Department of Justice employee. Until December 2017, in fact, he had two jobs within the DOJ: associate deputy attorney general, serving under Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF). But in December, he was demoted from associate deputy attorney general. The Justice Department didn’t detail the reasoning for the demotion, telling Fox News, “It is unusual for anyone to wear two hats as he has done recently,” but observers on the right assumed the real reason had to do with Ohr’s purported connections to the Steele dossier. The Steele dossier is a document that alleged Trump was under the influence of Russian intelligence services, who had also compiled blackmail material on him. Steele was working for a company called Fusion GPS, founded by a former Wall Street Journal journalist named Glenn Simpson. And though the FBI began to examine ties between Trump and Russia after George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, told an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, many on the right believe the dossier was responsible for the launch of the Russia investigation. Ohr met and emailed multiple times with Steele, who had been on the FBI payroll in the past as a source. According to emails revealed by the Hill earlier this month, contact between Ohr and Steele went on for more than a decade, from 2002 to 2017 — including after the FBI suspended its relationship with Steele because he shared information with the media. Also, Bruce Ohr’s wife Nellie Ohr, a Russian history expert, worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS on Russia-related matters in mid-2016 — a fact that Bruce Ohr didn’t share on federal disclosure forms. Most of this has been public knowledge since late last year, after Simpson, the Fusion GPS founder, testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017 about the creation of the Steele dossier and how much involvement Simpson and Fusion GPS had in the FBI’s investigation of the Trump presidential campaign’s potential Russia ties. In his testimony, Simpson said he met with Ohr after the election to provide information about how the dossier was made. However, as the Weekly Standard’s Eric Felten pointed out, his testimony took place before news broke about Nellie Ohr’s work with Fusion GPS, and Simpson didn’t mention the connection. Ohr was also mentioned in Rep. Devin Nunes’s heavily hyped memo, which alleged that the FBI abused its power in surveilling Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. The memo details how Steele told Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” Among many on the right, the implication is clear: Ohr’s involvement, whether via his meetings with Steele or through his wife’s work for Fusion GPS, casts aspersions on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, and taints the investigation itself. But according to Rosenstein, Ohr has never worked on the Mueller investigation or the 2016 surveillance of Carter Page, the Trump foreign policy adviser. Even the Nunes memo doesn’t imply that Ohr knew anything about surveillance applications or any of the other fine-grain pieces of the investigation itself. As my colleague Andrew Prokop wrote in February: The memo reveals that Steele was in contact with Ohr and that in September 2016, Steele shared some of his negative opinions on Trump. ... Yet note what the memo does not claim: that Ohr had anything to do with the surveillance application on Carter Page. Yes, it tries to imply that, by saying Ohr “worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein,” who were previously mentioned as approving the wiretap. ... But Yates and then Rosenstein were top justice officials overseeing basically everything in the department. Ohr was a subordinate of theirs, but his actual job was as the “Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces Director.” If he was involved in the Page wiretap specifically, Nunes sure doesn’t provide the evidence to show that. The reason, then, that the Ohr story has persisted in conservative media and finally made its way to Trump’s attention isn’t because conservatives know anything definitive about Ohr — what he did or didn’t know about the Russia investigation or Fusion GPS, or what he knew about his wife’s work with the firm. It’s because of optics. Ohr has helped back up a conservative case that the Russia investigation as a whole is an example of the unequal application of the rule of law. As Kimberley Strassel at the Wall Street Journal wrote on August 16, the Ohr case “smells of ... impropriety.” It feeds a narrative on the right that the Mueller investigation is ignoring actions performed by the Clinton campaign or the Obama administration that, they argue, might be just as bad, or worse. By not disclosing his wife’s job in federal disclosure forms and continuing to meet with Steele even after the FBI stopped working with him, Ohr has, in effect, made the DOJ and the Mueller probe look bad, said Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a contributor to National Review who has written extensively on Ohr. “Ohr has done nothing to clear up the impression that while initially the fourth-ranking official in the Trump DOJ, he was communicating with an apparently discredited FBI informant to traffic in or add to the contents of the dossier well after the campaign,” Hanson said. “The lack of transparency on the part of a DOJ official in areas outside his normal purview is disturbing.” Hanson argued that Ohr’s lack of professional involvement with the Russia investigation makes the situation worse, not better: “He was meeting with a disgraced FBI informant on matters that did not seem to have anything to do with his assigned tasks at DOJ,” he said. After being demoted from deputy assistant attorney general, Ohr was demoted again in January, losing his title of head of the OCDETF. And he’s stayed quiet — he hasn’t commented on Trump’s tweets, or the constant barrage of criticism from the White House, including being among the officials mentioned by press secretary Sarah Sanders as at risk of losing their security clearances. But others haven’t. As the administration has threatened former government employees with having their clearances revoked (and already has revoked the clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan), retired military and intelligence officials have widely criticized the revocations, which they view as being politically motivated. After serving the nation most use security clearances (and their trustworthiness) to contribute to national defense or to help US industries maintain an advantage. This isn’t really that hard to understand, except to those who only think about financial gain. https://t.co/SntNvhHeaw For Ohr, who is a current DOJ employee, losing his clearance wouldn’t just be detrimental to his reputation but (even though he does have some job protections as a civil servant) would most likely result in the loss of his job entirely — raising the stakes of Trump’s tweets. And it’s worth mentioning that much of the criticism Trump has aimed at Ohr has really been intended for Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice overall, stemming from Trump’s continue ire that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and a belief that the DOJ — the one manned by Trump’s own appointees — is being deeply unfair to him and should be focused on “Crooked Hillary.” As he tweeted on August 14, “If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt” — meaning the Mueller investigation — “would never have been started!” “They were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn’t do.” Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people. Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!",https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17704326/bruce-ohr-nellie-ohr-trump-mueller-russia-fusion-gps,,Vox
140,140,18-05-17 00:00,2017,5,18,Devon Van Houten Maldonado,"“In Mexico, Time Is Not Money”: A Residency Pushes Artists to Confront Difference and Colonialism","Arquetopia, which has locations in Puebla, Oaxaca, and, soon, the Peruvian city of Cusco, encourages resident artists to ask tough questions about colonialism, exoticism, and ethics. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads PUEBLA, Mexico — In the baroque capital of Puebla, an artist-run residency is attempting to challenge preconceived notions about tradition and context through a program focused on encounters and process, rather than production. Puebla was a hub for international trade and a seat of power, equal to or greater than Mexico City in riches during the 16th and 17th centuries, becoming what’s known today as ‘the city of churches,’ Mexico’s capital of baroque architecture. Here, Arquetopia instructs artists on the history of colonialism through programs combining traditional processes and academic readings. The residency’s Puebla headquarters hosts up to 12 artists at any given time, offering studio space, a natural pigments laboratory, a library, and a stocked kitchen. To date, artists from about 60 countries have made their way through the residency program, where local artists are also included in various projects as part of the mission of the founding directors. As Arquetopia’s residency and academic offerings have grown in popularity since its founding in 2009, the program has expanded from its headquarters in Puebla to a second space near the state capital of Oaxaca. A third space will open soon in Cusco, Peru, expanding the scope of the organization’s regional dialogue about history and decolonialism. At Arquetopia, artists are pushed to ask tough ethical questions about the nature of hybridity, exoticism, and their own ways of seeing. At a time when artists are grasping for forms of resistance beyond traditional protests, the thinkers working with Arquetopia offer an alternative pedagogy. I recently sat down with co-executive director Francisco Guevara at Arquetopia in Puebla (where, full disclosure, I was a writer in residence in June and July of 2016), to talk about what makes the program unique as a residency invested in shared responsibility and resistance to power. *  *  * Devon Van Houten Maldonado: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house” — I’ve heard you say this a million times. How is this statement by Audre Lorde central to Arquetopia’s program and mission? Francisco Guevara: Although we use different scholars and different readings with different focuses, most of them are used to understand a complex history and how that plays a role when you’re in a residency program. That specific reading is the one that usually strikes the artists and really changes them, in a positive way or in a negative way. It’s racially charged, of course, also in terms of gender and other things. Basically, what we share with Lorde is that, no matter what you do, you have to be aware of the structure. You can’t just romanticize the margins, or you can’t just think about the center as the enemy, because there is no center. We create these structures. I always mention and summarize it, in terms of artistic practice, as a shadow, and as long as you keep the shadow visible then you will be able to tackle the problem. DVHM: You touched a little bit on artists’ emotional reactions to the residency; what makes this such a charged experience for many of them? FG: Our residency isn’t about just producing but about actually stepping back and looking at the process, and the process is loaded with things you might not know or aren’t aware that you’re carrying with you. So it’s very emotional because it’s not just me dictating what it should be, but also a series of authors that are in dialogue and it becomes very emotional because it taps into deep problems. One of the things that I always try to get artists to step away from is this idea about how we share these same experiences. We don’t. Something very important is the integrity of differences. We can eventually cross paths in terms of the struggle and the problems, but we come with different perspectives. DVHM: What is Arquetopia’s pedagogy, beyond the traditional model of offering space, time, and critique? FG: The most important aspect of our residency is the encounters. Mexico has traditionally been the tropical paradise where anything is possible and everything is exotic. To this day, every famous Mexican artist who sells work outside of Mexico explores and uses these ideas that have historically been built around Mexico. We read Emmanuel Levinas’s theory of encounters and empathy — understanding empathy as a process that’s so complex, but tries to erase differences, and hinders the possibility of change. The difference in our program is precisely the encounters. We’ve had artists from Israel and Palestine here at the same time, or from the north and south of the United States, and they don’t share any of the same problems. However, we find a space where encounters can be renegotiated in terms of race, class, and gender. DVHM: Is it about creating empathy between artists, or between artists and the spaces they are working in? FG: It’s actually about destroying empathy because empathy has masqueraded the problems. When we talk about humanism — we’re all the same, and we share the same experiences — that’s false. We have to acknowledge the integrity of differences, and we need to preserve that integrity. Historically, those differences have been erased to enslave people, to conquer people, and to expand the empire. Now that capitalism is so prevalent and it’s organizing everything, we’ve learned that empathy is the possibility of understanding differences by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. That’s not only impossible, but you’re actually crushing the other by trying to be in his shoes and understand a reality that is impossible for you to understand. It doesn’t mean that you can’t connect and you can’t negotiate. DVHM: Thinking about residencies, especially in Mexico or other “exotic” locations, there is the idea of going somewhere to produce work and live among the natives. So considering the residency as a sort of “exotic” location, the production of contemporary art in centers, and the Eurocentric production of academic knowledge, what’s the discussion happening here within Arquetopia about the centers and margins of art? FG: It’s very relevant to what’s happening now because there is nostalgia. Even “make America great again,” it really captures the feeling of the world. It’s not only in the United States. It’s happening in Europe. It’s happening in Latin America. It’s happening everywhere, this idea of going back to pre-globalization spaces. Interestingly enough, it’s also going back to how the empires expanded to be able to enjoy disfrutar, meaning taking the fruit from something, taking everything. That idea has seeped into the contemporary art market. That’s why Mexico is a hot spot. Everything that shouldn’t be accessible and available or even comprehensible in other spaces is available in Mexico. It is very colorful. It is very attractive. It also really feeds into the imagination of someone who has never been exposed to different epistemologies. One of the things I say to artists when they get here — because they usually come from a tradition where time is money — is that in Mexico, time is not money. That epistemological understanding or concept of time really changes everything. When you don’t think of money and time as being the same, it allows for something completely different. DVHM: What about the specific context of Arquetopia in Puebla? FG: Puebla has never been on the map, except during the colonial period. However, it makes for a very interesting space for a residency program because we’re not in the capital of the empire, Mexico City. We aren’t in the dominant structure that connects with the gallery circuits. We’re in a different space with complexities that are very different. But that has allowed us to connect with local structures and inform the rest of the country in terms of material culture. It’s about process, not necessarily the market. It’s a program that has always operated based on reciprocity, innovation, shared responsibility, and local networks. DVHM: How about the context of your residency space in Oaxaca and the next space, which you will be opening in Cusco, Peru. FG: Going into Oaxaca was very complex. It’s a different language and way of operating. We decided to move the residency program to the mountains; it’s 30 minutes away from the city and this had a profound impact on the way artists are producing. To understand the traditions of Oaxaca you have to understand the environment, you have to be rooted in a community that isn’t just tourism. Peru was an eye-opening experience because it really completes the picture. Many of the techniques that we have in Puebla are similar, however with a very different language. Peru has a whole different set of challenges about how Europeans had a presence in Cusco. Some of the techniques there are in dialogue with Puebla and with Oaxaca. Many of the scholars whose work we use to understand these complexities and encounters have studied Peru as well. So completing this picture of the 300 years of history that Peru and Mexico share will allow us to have a dialogue regionally. DVHM: Your residency is unique in that you offer programs specific to certain traditional crafts, techniques, and materials. What’s the role of material and tradition in Arquetopia and the dialogue happening here? FG: These traditions were rooted in different possibilities that allowed many communities to survive through time and created infrastructure and elements of performativity that are important to identity. Sharon P. Holland describes it as how the West controls time, and how every speech about progress is about moving through time, and technology moving forward. Any other speech that isn’t about the West is about tradition. It’s about how we have the responsibility to preserve tradition, meaning we’re stuck in space. Being stuck in space allows those who control time to move forward and occupy our space. So that’s the challenge we face when we use techniques: To precisely challenge the idea that tradition is something that’s stuck in time, and it goes back to the encounter.",https://hyperallergic.com/368070/in-mexico-time-is-not-money-a-residency-pushes-artists-to-confront-difference-and-colonialism/,,Hyperallergic
141,141,10-02-17 15:09,2017,2,10,Noisey Staff,Let These Grime Instrumentals Wash Over You Like a Synthy Tide,"This article originally appeared on Noisey UK.  There's a certain feeling that ripples through your body when you hear a song that, to put it simply, slaps. It can be a swinging lurch in your belly, a goosebumps-creating shudder or the sense that someone's grabbed you by the shoulders and won't stop shaking you repeatedly—but, you know, in a good way.  As an instrument, the human voice makes a light flicker on in our minds—its the recognition of empathy, the comfort of now-woolly memories of your parents speaking to you when you were a baby, the bristling discomfort of a raised voice or one choked with panic.  But it's something else entirely to be able to do that with instrumentals alone. We've already written about the grime instrumental and its legacy in a genre that's come to be defined by the spitting, cajoling, winking voices of its most-respected MCs and rappers. Then you have someone like Shredda, a producer who's been quietly layering the beats over which the likes of Jammer, Shorty, P Money, and Footsie have rhymed in recent years. Shredda was responsible for the beats on both ""A Fun One"" and ""Bags Under My Eyes"", off P Money's 2015 album Money Over Everyone 2, and they're among the five songs he's putting out on his forthcoming Horrific Injustice EP. You can have a listen to it here now, before it's due to drop on Sunday 12 February. ""Listening to grime beats is something I enjoy doing,"" he tells us, ""but unlike house music and dubstep, instrumental grime doesn't get as much attention—although it's the most diverse genre. This is something I want to change."" And here's the way he plans to do it, with strings samples, beats that jump like popping candy and synths colliding over one another.

144,144,04-12-18 15:20,2018,12,4,Nadra Nittle,The way K-pop stars like BTS dress is shaping fashion trends worldwide,"To understand how influential K-pop is worldwide, look no further than social media. The 26th birthday of Jin, the singer-songwriter of Korea’s pop supergroup BTS, was by far the top Twitter trend globally Monday, garnering more than a million tweets. The Melon Music Awards, which honor Korea’s most popular musical acts, took place Saturday, and they too dominated Twitter as fans of groups like BTS, Blackpink, Mamamoo, and iKon gushed about the show. With roots in the 1990s, K-pop — a mix of pop, rap, electronica, and other genres with a South Korean twist — is affecting far more than social media trends and billboard charts. Fans of the music are taking up charitable causes, and according to the global fashion search engine Lyst, they are also wearing the same designers as their beloved K-pop idols. In its “Year in Fashion” report, which tracked more than 100 million searches from 80 million shoppers across the globe in 2018, Lyst identified K-pop stars as “major global fashion influencers.” It credits these performers with spiking searches related to brands like Moschino and Chrome Hearts after wearing them this year. 181201 Melon Music Award [HQ]Mon coco , Mon soleilI love all of you Taehyung.#뷔 #태형 #V #BTS⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠ #방탄소년단@BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/4e8jaN4MnM The omnipresence of K-pop fans on social media around the world is fueling the trend as well as the importance of visuals in the genre. Bright colors and bold prints are the norm when it comes to K-pop acts, who have made fads of the most mundane (and unexpected) pieces of clothing. A campaign T-shirt from Rev. Jesse Jackson’s failed 1988 presidential run became a must-have in South Korea this year after rapper Moonbyul of Mamamoo wore it. And the introduction of makeup lines for men is largely due to K-pop, since many members of the boy bands use “guyliner,” lip tints, and brow fillers; it’s no coincidence that South Korea reportedly makes up 20 percent of the global men’s cosmetics market. As K-pop’s influence spreads, it has shaped fashion trends in a way music hasn’t seen since the genesis of American hip-hop, when brands like Adidas, Kangol, and Jordans became must-haves for listeners. Designers, according to Lyst, would be wise to embrace K-pop’s impact on fashion, an almost certainly lucrative move. Most followed K-Pop Girl Groups on Instagram:1. #BLACKPINK - 13.657M2.

Pristin - 611k pic.twitter.com/M42QrnhNfY K-pop stars’ fashion sensibilities haven’t been lost on American publications like Vogue: The magazine named Sehun of the group EXO the “best-dressed man” at Louis Vuitton Resort’s 2019 show in May. It was the second consecutive year that Sehun received the shoutout from the magazine, which highlighted his “fuzzy mohair sweater with bold stripes” and the “red and white woven into each detail” of his outfit. The mix of textures and bold colors in Sehun’s outfit is representative of the K-pop look, in which artists lean toward vivid hues, sensual fabrics, and showy patterns. Lyst also mentioned Sehun’s appearance at Louis Vuitton in its “Year in Fashion.” Camilla Clarkson, the communications manager for the platform, told me fans’ social media activity plays a role in why the public has become so interested in what K-pop stars wear. “K-pop’s influence on fashion has been growing rapidly over the years alongside the rise of social media,” Clarkson said. “ No part of their life is too small for fans to tweet, vlog, or ’gram about. As a result, we’ve seen more global searches and sales this year than ever before, with fans desperate to get as close to the stars as possible.” Since fans can’t actually get to know the K-pop acts they idolize, buying the same items they buy is a way for them to feel connected to these stars. “Many of them aspire to imitate their favorite K-pop idols by dressing like them, so they use fashion search engines … to buy or seek inspiration from the exact pieces their idols are wearing,” Shelley Li of the K-Style Files, a database of K-pop fashions, told me. Lyst found that K-pop’s influence has spread across both women’s and men’s fashion, with boy bands like BTS and EXO and women K-pop stars like CL and Park Bom all driving fashion trends. And a group like BTS can inspire both men and women to dress like them. When rapper Suga from the group wore a checked shirt designed by Virgil Abloh, searches for it increased 120 percent, according to Lyst. The same occurred when RM, another BTS rapper, wore a pink Adidas number; searches for pink T-shirts rose by 97 percent. Li credits the globalization of K-pop music with its growing influence on fashion trends. As K-pop fans have spread from South Korea to countries such as South Africa, the Philippines, and the United States, the fashions its stars wear have more eyes on them and, thus, more copycats. But Li and Clarkson say the specific visuals associated with the music also play a role. “K-pop comes in a visually stimulating package — high-production music videos and performances with vibrant sets, lighting, and, of course, fashion,” Li said. Clarkson describes K-pop music videos as pushing boundaries and said that each artist is expected to have a distinct fashion sense. “K-pop music videos are a fantastic, slick operation,” she said. “They push boundaries and highlight that too much is never enough — from bright, colorful hair and makeup to trend-defying fashion. Each star, or ‘idol,’ as they’re known in Korea, has a unique personality and style.” While K-pop stars have received plenty of praise for their style, their sartorial choices have sometimes sparked controversy. In November, BTS drew criticism for wearing hats bearing Nazi symbols during a photo shoot. Three years ago, the group faced a similar controversy after taking part in a photo shoot at the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. The Simon Wiesenthal Center also pointed out that BTS has performed onstage waving large flags that looked similar to the Nazi swastika. Just last month, a scheduled TV appearance featuring BTS was canceled because one member reportedly wore a shirt that included an image of the atomic bomb dropping on Japan. The Simon Wiesenthal Center subsequently declared that BTS owed both the Japanese people and victims of Nazism an apology. “It is clear that those designing and promoting this group’s career are too comfortable with denigrating the memory of the past,” said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, in a statement. “The result is that young generations in Korea and around the world are more likely to identify bigotry and intolerance as being ‘cool’ and help erase the lessons of history.” It’s unclear how much BTS knows about what the imagery on their clothes symbolizes, or if the group members dress themselves. After the controversies over the group’s clothing in November, Big Hit Entertainment, the agency representing them, issued an apology, stating it “had no intention of causing distress or pain” to those affected by the atomic bomb or by Nazism: The incident was in no way intentional, and although all apparel and accessories used during the photoshoot had been provided by the publication conducting the shoot, we would like to offer our sincere apologies for inadvertently inflicting pain and distress to anyone affected by totalitarian regimes in the past by failing to strictly review the clothing and accessories that our members were made to wear, as well as to anyone who may have experienced distress and discomfort by witnessing an association of our artists with imagery reminiscent of political extremism. Clearly, with international fame comes even more responsibility for a supergroup like BTS to dress in a way that takes into account how certain imagery may be read by a wide range of audiences. Still, the fact that BTS has dominated worldwide trends on Twitter during the first few days of December indicates that the controversies related to their clothing certainly haven’t curbed the zeal that surrounds the group. Camilla Clarkson predicts that K-pop and its stars will continue to dominate fashion trends next year. That means more male makeup, unconventional T-shirt choices, brightly colored hair, and bold prints — from stripes to zigzags to polka dots — and clothes featuring cartoon or video game characters. Given this, Clarkson argues that Western fashion designers in particular would be wise to capitalize on the trend. It took mid- and high-end brands years to embrace hip-hop after rappers stepped out in brands like Coach, Gucci, and Cartier. Gucci specifically has fans in rap artists like Lil Pump and in BTS alike. Predictably, it has seen more sales thanks to a boom in Generation Z and young millennial shoppers, likely influenced by these artists. For luxury fashion brands to wait as long to welcome K-pop as they did hip-hop would be a mistake, at least financially. “Western designers would do well to see [K-pop] not just as a place for inspiration,” Clarkson said, “but an area to involve themselves in to help bolster sales.” Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?

145,145,27-03-19 00:00,2019,3,27,,U.S. current account deficit hits 10-year high; firms bring back more foreign profits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased more than expected in the fourth quarter amid declining exports, pushing the overall shortfall in 2018 to its highest level in 10 years, and U.S. companies repatriated a record amount of foreign earnings last year following the Republican tax overhaul.  The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 6.1 percent to $134.4 billion. The quarterly current account gap was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008.  Data for the third quarter was revised to show the deficit rising to $126.6 billion from the previously reported $124.8 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit rising to $130.0 billion in the fourth quarter.  The current account gap represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, the largest share since the second quarter of 2012. It was up from 2.5 percent in the July-September period.  The deficit increased 8.8 percent in 2018 to $488.5 billion, the highest level since 2008. For all of 2018, the current account deficit averaged 2.4 percent of GDP, the biggest share since 2012, from 2.3 percent in 2017.  The deficit on the current account has shrunk from a peak of 6.2 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, in part because of a significant increase in the volume of oil exports.  In the fourth quarter, exports of goods fell 0.9 percent to $416.1 billion, while imports were unchanged at $649.1 billion.  Meanwhile, the flow of foreign profits repatriated by U.S. companies slowed to $85.9 billion in the fourth quarter from an upwardly revised $100.7 billion in the prior period, reflecting a diminishing impact from corporate tax overhaul that went into effect last January.   Earnings repatriation peaked at $294.7 billion in the first quarter immediately after the law took effect but has tailed off each quarter since. Even so, it remains well above pre-tax cut levels.  For the full year, foreign profits brought back to U.S. shores by American companies surged to a record $664.9 billion, more than four times the $155.1 billion logged in 2017 and more than twice the previous record in 2005.

147,147,22-10-17 00:00,2017,10,22,Christian Shepherd,"For some Chinese dissidents, party congress means a paid 'vacation'","BEIJING (Reuters) - Hu Jia, a well-known Chinese dissident who lives in Beijing, says he had hoped to go to the southeastern city of Xiamen for his government-sponsored holiday, but state security officials said no.   “They told me I had to go to a more isolated place this time,” he told Reuters by phone from Yunnan province in far southwestern China, a popular destination renowned for its scenery and the culture of its ethnic minority groups.  Rights groups say that Hu is one dozens of activists and dissidents detained, placed under tighter monitoring or “vacationed” by authorities,  during the week-long congress of the ruling Communist Party which began on Wednesday in Beijing. President Xi Jinping is expected to tighten his grip on power at the gathering, which is only held once every five years.  For his enforced holiday, Hu and his two government minders jointly decided on the destinations. Hu suggested the ancient town of Dali in Yunnan for the first stop, and the public security agents accompanying him chose the second and third stops in the southwest region, Guiyang — the capital of the mountainous province of Guizhou, and the coastal city of Beihai in Guangxi province.   Hu estimated the whole trip for the three of them will cost close to 10,000 yuan ($1,510), all paid for by the authorities. He said that his minders tried to save money by choosing basic hotels and traveling between the three cities by bus.  He will fly back to Beijing on Oct 28, just after the congress ends.  “You can go see the sights, but state security goes with you everywhere,” Hu said.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the accounts of Hu and other dissidents interviewed for this story.  China’s public security ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the detention of activists, and the use of “vacations.” China rarely explains its treatment of dissidents other than to say that those charged are criminals who harmed social stability and that all people in China are treated equally before the law.  It is not unusual for Chinese authorities to heighten monitoring and detention of dissidents before important political events, especially people with high profiles who are  known to speak out against the party and state.  In addition to the enforced vacations, some activists have also been detained, placed under supervision at home, or warned about posting critical messages online in the weeks ahead of congress, according to the Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders.   The group also said it had documented 14 cases of detention of activists in recent weeks.  In one case, Wu Kemu, a truck driver from Xuancheng city in the central province of Anhui, was called in by the police for a talk on October 11 and has not been released since, his wife Fang Liangxiang told Reuters by phone on Sunday.  “They will not say when he will be released. They just told me to wait at home for him,” she said, adding that she expected the detention was related to critical things Wu had said about the government on the popular instant messaging platform WeChat.  No one answered the phone on Saturday at the Xuancheng city detention center where Fang says Wu is being held.  It is unclear if the total number of detentions, arrests or “vacations” this year is greater than at the time of previous major events or how many of the cases are directly related to the congress.  Some activists say that the authorities prefer enforced vacations rather than detentions as they can make dissidents both inactive and inaccessible to foreign journalists over sensitive periods. Locking people up can attract more attention.  Hu, a pro-democracy activist and campaigner for those with HIV/AIDS, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for subversion in 2008, and said he has been under regular state surveillance since his release.  “The first thing I did was go for a run up in the mountains by Dali, because I knew the state security agents could not run with me,” he said, adding that the agents were “not the running type.”  “It felt like being briefly free from prison,” he said.  Hu said that state security agents had shown him a list of people who would not be allowed to stay in Beijing over the 19th Party Congress, including Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.      Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest in Beijing since her husband won the Nobel Prize in 2010. After his death in July, even the sporadic communications she’s had with friends have been nearly entirely severed, two of them told Reuters.  The public security ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Liu Xia’s situation.  Some activists make their own travel plans to avoid the authorities.  Wu Lihong, an activist from Wuxi city in Jiangsu province who for over a decade has been protesting pollution in Lake Tai in eastern China, told Reuters that Chinese state security had called him last week saying they were coming to take him for a forced vacation. Wu, though, had already gone to visit a friend in Zhejiang province, on the east coast and far away from Beijing, to avoid them.  “At the 16th, 17th and 18th Congresses I was vacationed, imprisoned, held at home and forbidden to speak,” Wu said.   “This time, I chose to go on holiday without them,” he said.  He said that state security officials had asked him to return to Wuxi so they could take him on “vacation” themselves, but he declined saying he would stay with his friend till after the congress ends. He is now avoiding their calls.  Reuters could not independently confirm Wu’s comments.  Chinese state security does not have a public phone number, fax number or website.      Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on rights lawyers and activists since coming to power in 2012, jailing dozens, in what rights groups say is a coordinated attempt to quash dissent in China.  New internet measures include rules that hold users accountable for critical posts even in private group chats and a renewed crackdown on technologies to circumvent restrictions.   Kit Chan, director of the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, said that some recent detentions of activists represent a new direction in the crackdown as it shows the authorities are targeting smaller groups that draw attention to specific rights issues as much as their traditional focus on pro-democracy activists.  Zhen Jianghua, for example, the founder of Human Rights Campaign in China, a grassroots organization based in the southern province of Guangzhou, was detained on Sept 1 in Zhuhai, a source close to Zhen who declined to be named told Reuters.  The ministry of public security did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the targeting of grassroots organizations. A person who answered the phone at the Zhuhai public security bureau said she was not aware of Zhen’s case.

Several other Senators demanded such an investigation during Thursday's testimony, and Flake suggested the investigation should only delay the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation by a week. President Trump ﻿is one huge step closer to getting his guy, Brett Kavanaugh ﻿on the Supreme Court -- the Senate Judiciary Committee just voted 11-10 to recommend he be confirmed. The Committee has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, so the tally comes as no shock -- even after Thursday's emotional day of testimony from Kavanaugh and his sexual assault accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The next step for Kavanaugh is the confirmation vote before the full Senate. Before he cast his vote recommending confirmation, Sen. Jeff Flake came face-to-face with two sexual assault victims who confronted and cornered him in an elevator on Capitol Hill. The incident might have had some impact -- before the Committee voted, Sen. Flake requested the Senate vote be delayed for one week to let the FBI conduct an investigation. However, the Committee voted to recommend confirmation ... and did NOT insist on the one-week delay. Emotions have been running high since Thursday's nearly 9 hours of testimony. Two other women -- Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick -- also levied allegations but were not allowed to testify. Ford recounted Kavanaugh's alleged attack on her at a house party when they were in high school. Kavanaugh followed, and vehemently denied the allegations ... seemingly coming unhinged at times. The Senate is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation next week. If, as expected, he's confirmed, he'll become Trump's second Supreme Court appointee... joining Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed last year for the high court.",https://www.tmz.com/2018/09/28/brett-kavanaugh-senate-judiciary-committee-votes-recommendation-supreme-court/,,TMZ

In February, the FBI's legal team convinced a federal judge that Apple would need to produce a piece of code to bypass its own security standards and the phone's auto-erase function.

The two shooters were killed by police in the aftermath. Apple is fighting the order, citing concerns about the precedent that this would set in future cases in the United States and elsewhere. The FBI responded by slamming Apple's lack of cooperation as a cheap marketing ploy. The global technological consensus is against the FBI. Why? Here's one example: — Edward Snowden (@Snowden)March 8, 2016 Snowden referred to a blog post on the American Civil Liberties Union website to support his view. The post, written by Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a technology fellow at the ACLU, says: ""The truth is that even if this feature is enabled on the device in question, the FBI doesn't need to worry about it, because they can already bypass it by backing up part of the phone (called the 'Effaceable Storage') before attempting to guess the passcode."" He explains that the auto-erase function doesn't actually wipe the phone of its content. Instead, it deletes the ""file system key"" that is kept in the iPhone's effaceable storage, which is basically a flash memory file. ""The FBI wants us to think that this case is about a single phone, used by a terrorist,"" Gillmor writes. ""But it's a power grab: law enforcement has dozens of other cases where they would love to be able to compel software and hardware providers to build, provide and vouch for deliberately weakened code."" Meanwhile, it looks like the relationship between the FBI and the NSA — two intelligence agencies that are meant to operate mostly independent from one another — has gotten a lot cozier without anyone noticing. Related: Bill Gates Says the FBI Only Wants to Unlock One iPhone — But There Are 12 Other Cases FBI privacy and surveillance rules are subject to reevaluation and certification each year. In 2014, according to an annual report published by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Group (PLCOB), the FBI was, very quietly, given direct and mostly unlimited access to NSA files containing enormous collections of metadata — international emails, texts and phone calls — many of which had an American citizen on one end of the phone or computer. The watchdog group was established by President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks to assuage public concern about mass surveillance. US officials confirmed this to the Guardian this week. Those rules reportedly meant FBI officials were at liberty to scroll through the data for ""routine"" queries that have nothing to do with national security, and did not require authorities to disclose or make a record of who and what they were searching.  Because identifiable information in the NSA data set isn't redacted, the FBI effectively had access to information that it would otherwise have needed sa a warrant for.  The PCLOB annual report has repeatedly expressed concerns over the FBI's apparently unlimited access to American's private communications. In the latest report, the PLCOB noted that some of that power had been reined in in response to concerns about ""many"" FBI agents who had access to NSA data. In the most recent PCLOB report, the secret court that governs surveillance had reportedly submitted ""revised FBI minimization procedures"" in response to the watchdog's concerns. ""Changes have been implemented based on PCLOB recommendations, but we cannot comment further due to classification,"" Christopher Allen, a spokesman for the FBI, told the Guardian. Details of the changes made to FBI access of NSA information haven't been released. Timothy Barrett, a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence, said the changes will be released eventually but said they couldn't provide a date just yet.

156,156,14-01-16 00:00,2016,1,14,Michael Blum,The Virtual-Reality Future Is Here,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Many expect 2016 to be the year that virtual reality (VR) finally takes off. And indeed, recent developments signal that, this year, VR will finally go from being a buggy, vertigo-inducing prototype — an exhilarating idea executed poorly, and most accessible to industry insiders — to a viable platform, and a soon-to-be widely available one at that. Last week Oculus, a trailblazer in VR technology, opened preorders for the consumer version of its Rift display system, shocking many with its high initial price point of $600. The Facebook-owned company is not without competition — HTC, Playstation, and Microsoft are rolling out consumer models of their own, and Google’s VR project is firmly under development. Prices for these latter models are as of yet unknown, while Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has already responded to criticism of his system’s prohibitive cost, promising that it will eventually drop. Although these VR systems are being marketed primarily to the gaming community, developers are already exploring possibilities beyond blowing virtual holes in living room walls. For instance, the Oculus Rift will ship packaged with “Medium,” a toolkit for sandbox experimentation with forms, allowing users to manipulate shape, color, light, and texture à la MS Paint updated to 3D (the HTC Vive will run a similar software called “Tilt Brush”). The prospects presented by a new medium in its infancy are surely as daunting as they are appealing — their technical capabilities seemingly unbounded, their formal possibilities unexplored, and their aesthetic criteria undetermined. Third-party developers and artists have already begun tapping into this potential in a number of ways, by building aesthetic sensoria with rigorous 3D modeling, rendering animated worlds that users can engage with far more viscerally than in an ordinary video game, and by adapting cinema’s moving images from the 2D screen to the 360° arena, thrusting the spectator into the very movement of a documentary or fiction. Without a doubt, VR’s repercussions for older, more familiar notions of cinematic realism are astounding. The mortality of cinema is a topic that has been endlessly ruminated on; the advent of VR makes clear that it’s not cinema’s death that is demanding of reflection, but rather its afterlife in new and different media. Sensory Stories, an exhibition mounted last year at the Museum of the Moving Image, presented several Oculus-powered works, hinting at some of the paths moving-image artists may pursue as they increasingly turn their attention to the new frontier of VR. Herders (2014), by Félix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael, is a VR documentary that unobtrusively observes the daily lives of several Mongolian nomads. The work, owing to the technology it makes use of, grants the viewer the ability to scan hilly vistas in any direction, and the sheer act of being able to look over your shoulder while remaining within the frame of the seamless panorama breeds an intense, vertiginous wonder. VR works are multifocal by default, and Herders is no exception — at any given moment you can gaze at the horizon, eye a musical performance, or spy an old man eating in the corner of a tent. Works like these urge the viewer to decide for themselves what is worth focusing on, often resulting in an intensely voyeuristic viewing experience. What at times is bewitchingly, subtly real in Herders can also acquire a pronounced social aspect. As the viewer is enclosed in the movement of the work — as though truly present, for example, at the herders’ family dinner — empathetic identification with the subjects is heightened to a degree only graspable if experienced firsthand. This displacement of the viewer’s own perspective, coinciding with the adoption of that of another, is a function of VR that will no doubt be used and abused, and will likely spark a heady revival of debates — aesthetic and otherwise — about the politics of spectatorship. Indeed, it doesn’t take a great deal of cynicism to see this technology being gobbled up wholesale by the entertainment-military complex and being catered, for example, to the arms and defense sector, providing immersive, photorealistic combat training programs to militaries the world over. Nonetheless, VR is an astounding technology, and its being made available to the consumer public — as well as to artists, teachers, and other prospective developers and users — will be a groundbreaking event in the unfolding procession of new media.",https://hyperallergic.com/268442/the-virtual-reality-future-is-here/,,Hyperallergic

158,158,31-10-16 17:32,2016,10,31,Kurt Wagner,Here are all the things Peter Thiel said about Donald Trump and Gawker on Monday,"Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel is a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump; he is also the man who helped bankrupt Gawker media. In the tech and media worlds, that essentially makes him Public Enemy No. 1. On Monday Thiel set out to defend himself. At an hour-long press event at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Thiel answered a bunch of questions about everything from his million dollar donation to Trump’s campaign to his multi-million dollar donation to Hulk Hogan’s lawyers. Thiel said a lot, so we’ve pulled out some of his more interesting quotes here. We’re still sifting through everything, and will add more as we go. On whether or not his support of Trump has hurt his business: “Not in any meaningful way. ... It certainly has generated a tremendous amount of discussion. I’ve gotten a lot of pushback from people, to say the least. But I think my friendships, close working business relationships, I think all those are very well intact.” On Silicon Valley’s disconnect with the rest of the country: “The story people in Silicon Valley always want to tell is the one in which their specific success as individuals and as companies gets conflated with a story of general success and general progress in the United States. ‘So we’re doing well, therefore our whole civilization is doing well, everybody’s doing well, the whole country’s taken to the next level.’ That’s the narrative people love to tell — specific success linked to general success. I think the truth has been one of more specific success, but more general failure.” On his $1.25 million donation to Donald Trump, which came shortly after Trump faced backlash for a tape in which he admitted to grabbing women inappropriately: “I think the tape was in extremely poor taste, extremely inappropriate. I didn’t even think as much about the donation as I should have. My general perspective on this year was that money actually didn’t matter that much. The candidates who raised the most money on the presidential level did incredibly badly. I didn’t even think that Trump needed my money. He hadn’t raised that much money, they didn’t ask me for money, I hadn’t donated. So when they asked me I wasn’t sure they needed it, but I thought I’d go ahead and write them a check. But I didn’t think that much of this connection. Of course, I didn’t think anybody would think that you would donate to a candidate because of the worst thing they’ve done. You support candidates normally because of the things you like about them, not the things you dislike.” On whether or not Trump would try and repeal LGBT rights if elected President: “I have not had conversations with Mr. Trump on that specific subject. I do think he represents a sea change from the Republican party of [George W.] Bush. You just look at the way Bush was speaking about gay marriage at every single campaign event in the 2004 election. Everything [Trump’s] indicated is that he’d be quite expansive on gay rights.” On whether Thiel supports a ban on Muslims coming to the U.S., a stance Trump has campaigned on: “I don’t support a religious test. I certainly don’t support the specific language Trump has used in every instance. I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media always is taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally. I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously but not literally. So when they hear things like the Muslim comment, or the wall comment, or things like that, the question is not, ‘are we going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China?’ or ‘How exactly are you going to enforce these tests?’ What they hear is ‘we’re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.’” On why he funded Hulk Hogan’s sex tape lawsuit against Gawker, and why he kept it private: “I got involved over a number of years and it was one of these things once you got involved, you started to believe in the justice of the case more and more because there were so many different people you interacted with who had been destroyed, in most cases it was not super prominent people, or super wealthy people. It was people who could not afford to do anything. And one of the striking things was that if you’re middle class, if you’re upper middle class, if you’re a single digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to our legal system. It costs too much. This was the modus operandi of Gawker in large part, to go after people who had no chance of fighting back. ... My judgement was Mr. Hogan deserved to have his day in court.” On whether or not he set a dangerous precedent by suing Gawker media into bankruptcy: “I don’t think so. Let’s start with the facts of the case. It involved a sex tape. If you make a sex tape of someone with their permission, you are a pornographer. If you make a sex tape without their permission, we were told now, you are a journalist. I would submit that as an insult to all journalists. This is not about the First Amendment, it is about the most egregious violation of privacy imaginable.” On whether or not wealthy, powerful people should be able to sue a media organization for a story they disagree with: “Wealthy people shouldn’t do that. I think if they try they won’t succeed. Gawker was a pretty flimsy business. It was a bad business, it didn’t make that much money. They could have withstood all the lawsuits. They lost because of the enormous verdict that came in against them. That’s why they lost at the end of the day ... I was very careful in the Hulk Hogan litigation in picking a lawsuit where the fight was over privacy. We did not even bring a libel action because that was sort of the way I wanted to make clear in the Hogan case that it was not about the media more generally.” On whether or not he’s currently suing any other media organizations: “I’ve been involved in the Gawker case and nothing else.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/10/31/13478494/peter-thiel-donald-trump-gawker-quotes,,Vox

TORONTO (AP) — A former Canadian diplomat has been detained while visiting Beijing, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Michael Kovrig was detained Monday night in Beijing during one of his regular visits to the city, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak publicly on the matter. The detention comes after China warned Canada of consequences for its recent arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver's airport. It's unclear if there's any link between the cases. The Globe and Mail in Toronto and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. had earlier reported Kovrig's detention, also citing unnamed sources. The International Crisis Group said earlier Tuesday it was aware of the reports that its North East Asia senior adviser had been detained. The Hong Kong-based Kovrig had served as the political lead for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to that city in 2016. The Brussels-based non-governmental organization said in a statement that it was doing everything possible to obtain additional information about Kovrig's whereabouts and that it will work to ensure his prompt release. The International Crisis Group said Kovrig has been one of its full-time experts since February 2017.The organization's website says Kovrig previously worked as a Canadian diplomat in Beijing and Hong Kong and at the United Nations. Canada's Global Affairs department didn't immediately respond with comment. Former Canadian Liberal leader Bob Rae said it's clear why he's been detained. ""It's called repression and retaliation,"" Rae tweeted. Kovrig wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he had served as the political lead on a visit Trudeau made to Hong Kong in September 2016. He worked in Canada's consulate-general in Hong Kong at the time. Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau, said that Chinese ""retaliation against Canadian interests or Canadians would be unacceptable and pointless.""

The plan is more wide-reaching than previous ones and aims to tackle household poverty as the root cause of child labor, said Patricia Sylvie Yao, executive secretary of the national committee for the fight against child labor and trafficking.  “Today we have decided to expand our actions,” said Yao.   “What we plan to do is help empower women, because experience shows that when a woman has an income-generating activity, it reinforces the wellbeing of the family,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, launched its first national action plan against child labor in 2012, but the problem remains widespread in poor farming communities.  An estimated 890,000 children work in the cocoa sector, some for their parents and some trafficked from abroad, according to a 2018 report by anti-slavery organization Walk Free Foundation.  Thousands of children also work in mines or as domestic servants, said Yao.  The new action plan, the country’s third, will run from 2019-2021 at a cost of 76 billion CFA Francs ($132 million).   A cocoa industry representative said it goes further than previous strategies by tackling issues such as supply chain traceability and illegal plantations in protected forests.  “This one I think does a more intensive job of looking across the Ivorian government and taking into account what the whole of government is doing,” said Tim McCoy, vice president for country relations at the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF).  Measures such as empowering women and investing in education may not seem directly linked to child labor, but do have an impact, he said.      Ivory Coast has rescued 8,000 victims of child labor since 2012, but more needs to be done to strengthen police capacity, said First Lady Dominique Ouattara at a launch event on Tuesday.   Last year it improved efforts to eliminate human  trafficking but fell short of the minimum standards, particularly regarding law enforcement, according to the U.S. State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Government officials were complicit in trafficking and police did not have enough resources to investigate cases, said the report, released last week.

162,162,07-06-19 00:00,2019,6,7,"Andrey Ostroukh, Katya Golubkova","Putin stands by China, criticizes U.S., in trade, Huawei disputes","ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Aggressive U.S. tactics such as a campaign against Chinese telecoms firm Huawei will lead to trade wars - and possibly real wars - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, in a show of solidarity with China alongside its leader Xi Jinping.  In some of his strongest words on the subject, Putin accused Washington of “unbridled economic egoism”. He singled out U.S. efforts to thwart a Russian gas pipeline to Europe and a U.S. campaign to persuade countries to bar Huawei, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, from supplying network gear.  His broadside, at an economic forum in St Petersburg on the same platform as Xi, was a clear show of unity with China at a time when Beijing is locked in a trade war with Washington and Moscow’s own ties with the West are at a post-Cold War low.     “States which previously promoted free trade with honest and open competition have started speaking the language of trade wars and sanctions, of open economic raiding using arm-twisting and scare tactics, of eliminating competitors using so-called  non-market methods,” said Putin.  “Look for example at the situation around Huawei which they are trying not to just squeeze out, but to unceremoniously push out of the global market. It’s already being called the first technological war of the emerging digital era in some circles.”  The world risked slipping into an era when “general international rules will be exchanged for the laws of administrative and legal mechanisms ... which is how the United States is unfortunately behaving, spreading its jurisdiction over the whole world,” added Putin.  “...It’s a path to endless conflicts, trade wars and maybe not just trade wars. Figuratively speaking, it’s a path to battles without rules that pit everyone against everyone else.”  Putin also complained about the U.S. dollar, calling it an instrument of pressure whose role in the financial system should be reconsidered.  China’s Xi struck a more conciliatory tone, calling for world powers to protect the global multilateral trade system. Speaking through an interpreter, he said it was “hard to imagine a complete break” between the United States and China.  “We are not interested in this, and our American partners are not interested in this. President Trump is my friend and I am convinced he is also not interested in this,” Xi said.  Russia has long complained about Western sanctions imposed on it over disputes including its behavior in Ukraine. Moscow casts the restrictions as an attempt to contain its growth.  Washington has asked countries to reject Huawei technology in the development of new mobile phone networks, arguing that it could be vulnerable to Chinese eavesdropping. Huawei denies its equipment is a security risk.

GIF: Google Canada  The news comes on National Aboriginal Day, which recognizes and celebrates the culture of Indigenous peoples. (As of next year, it will be renamed National Indigenous Peoples Day.) About 1.4 million people in Canada self-identify as Inuit, Métis, or First Nations. With the change, Indigenous people who search for their homes and territories will be able to see borders and overlays of the large parts of the country which are Indigenously administered.  There are a bunch of compelling reasons why these places should be represented in the cold, hard data of maps.  ""Colonial understandings of land quite often come down to relationships to maps,"" said David Gaertner, who teaches topics like Indigenous new media at the University of British Columbia, and was not affiliated with Google's project. These changes come during Canada 150, a controversial celebration of the country's 150th anniversary, one that many Indigenous peoples have been resisting as marking 150 years of colonialism. Indigenous Lands in Google Maps: Canada  ""In the wake of Canada 150, the nationalism is just rampant,"" said Gaertner. ""I think it has a way of getting in the way of these conversations. We've seen some pretty tough stuff come up recently around the cultural appropriation debates. And I think, in a lot of ways, a lot of settler Canadians have proven themselves not to be ready for these conversations.""   Read More: This Augmented Reality App Tells Indigenous Stories in Canadian Cities  According to a Google blog authored by Tara Rush, Kanien'kehá:ka from Akwesasne, the update came after seven years of collaboration with Indigenous communities in Canada. Google partnered with The Firelight Group's Steve DeRoy, a cartographer and part of Ebb and Flow First Nation in Manitoba.  ""It's important to me because there are so many Indigenous groups across the country and to not see them as an important fabric of a base map, just to not be recognized, it's insulting,"" he told the CBC.  In Google's blog, DeRoy explained that Indigenous peoples felt underrepresented in their mapping software after participating in Indigenous Mapping Workshops.   There are certain cartographic elements still missing. A future update with details like the unceded Algonquin lands in Ontario (on which Ottawa, the nation's capital, sits) could be an important way to acknowledge the historical nature of Canada's geographic relationship with Indigenous peoples.   There are other Indigenous-led efforts to preserve and share history through cartography. For example, Adrian Duke has created an augmented reality app which uses location data to tell the histories and stories of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Have you ever considered the points of intersection between early video art and psychotherapy? No? Well, why not start this weekend, with a program exploring the topic at EFA Project Space. “Surrounded by Me” looks at the adoption of video in the 1970s in both artistic and clinical psychotherapy practices. As the event’s organizers, artist Tyler Coburn and art historian Robin Simpson, write: “Where Nancy Holt utters, ‘I am surrounded by me’ in Boomerang (1974), as she negotiates the echoes of her voice fed back through a headset, so a colleague of [psychotherapist Milton M.] Berger’s, facing a fleet of cameras and monitors, remarks, ‘I feel surrounded by myself.’” The primary connection there, Coburn and Simpson argue, is narcissism, and the way it played out in these fields and across our larger society. In an attempt to investigate this overlap, and perhaps others, the pair has planned an evening and an afternoon of presentations and screenings at EFA. On Saturday, pediatrician Felix Rietmann, cultural historian Judith Rodenbeck, and Simpson himself will speak. On Sunday, video psychotherapy training tapes from the 1970s will share a lineup with artworks by Richard Serra and Nancy Holt, Howardena Pindell, Sadie Benning, Coburn, and others. The potential for cross-disciplinary conversation and discovery here is rich and intriguing.

In a video on Facebook, Fujimori, 79, vowed that as a free man, he would support Kuczynski’s call for reconciliation, hinting that he would not return to politics.  “I’m aware the results of my government were well received by some, but I acknowledge I also disappointed other compatriots,” the ailing Fujimori said, reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed. “And to them, I ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart.”   The remarks were Fujimori’s first explicit apology to the Andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990-2000.  They came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help Kuczynski survive a scandal.  The pardon cleared Fujimori’s convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government.  Late on Monday, Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, appealed to Peruvians opposed to the pardon to “turn the page” and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress.  “I cannot keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took, which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation,” Fujimori said.

As usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal & Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts! Do Democrats “own” the rising rates, though? Not if you ask the health insurers and policy experts who have set and study those premiums. As Vox documented in great detail, premiums on the law’s marketplaces were expected to stabilize this year, as insurers finally adjusted to the customers who were buying coverage. Single-digit rate increases, on average, were anticipated. It wasn’t perfect, but the law was reaching an equilibrium. But then Trump intervened. He sowed uncertainty about whether the law’s individual mandate would be enforced. He cut funding for advertising and enrollment outreach. Then the president stopped key cost-sharing payments to health insurers, which compensate companies for offering discounts on out-of-pocket costs to their lower-income customers. Insurers had warned they would hike rates as a result. As Vox reported earlier, health plans and actuaries say Trump’s actions have raised premiums by at least 25 percent and as much as 45 percent from what they otherwise would have been. Millions of Americans who receive federal assistance to buy insurance will be insulated from the rising rates. But the law’s middle-class customers who make too much money to receive that aid — many of them Republicans — will be on the hook.

168,168,11-06-19 00:00,2019,6,11,Kate Kelland,Mental illness affects a fifth of people living in war zones,"LONDON (Reuters) - One in five people in war zones has depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, with many suffering severe forms of these mental illnesses.  The findings highlight the long-term impact of war-induced crises in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the UN’s health agency said, and the numbers are significantly higher than in peacetime populations, where around one in 14 people has a mental illness.  “Given the large numbers of people in need and the humanitarian imperative to reduce suffering, there is an urgent need to implement scalable mental health interventions to address this burden,” the research team said.  Mark van Ommeren, a mental health specialist at the WHO who worked on the team, said the findings “add yet more weight to the argument for immediate and sustained investment, so that mental and psychosocial support is made available to all people in need living through conflict and its aftermath”.  In 2016, the number of ongoing armed conflicts reached an all-time high of 53 in 37 countries and 12% of the world’s people are living in an active war zone, according to United Nations figures. Since World War Two, almost 69 million people globally have been forced to flee war and violence.  The WHO’s conflict mental health study, published in The Lancet medical journal, was carried out by a team of researchers from the WHO, Australia’s Queensland University, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and Harvard University in the United States.  It analyzed research from 129 studies and data from 39 countries published between 1980 and August 2017.   Regions that have seen conflict in the last 10 years were included and mental illnesses were categorized as either mild, moderate or severe. Natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as Ebola, were not included.   Overall in war zones, the average prevalence was highest for mild mental health conditions, at 13%. Around 4% of people living amid armed conflict had moderate mental health illness, and for severe conditions the prevalence was 5%.  The study also found that rates of depression and anxiety in conflict settings appeared to increase with age, and depression was more common among women than men.  The study was funded by the WHO, the Queensland Department of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

FedEx’s announcement of its suit on Monday came shortly after the U.S. parcel delivery firm reignited Chinese ire over its business practices. A package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an “operational error.”  Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. A number of other Chinese firms have also been banned from buying sensitive U.S. technology.  In its lawsuit, FedEx said it should not be expected to enforce the export ban, and could not reasonably be held liable for shipping products that it did not know about.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the regulation stated that carriers must not knowingly ship items in contravention of the rules. “It does not require a common carrier to be a policeman or to know what’s in every package,” he said.   UPS said in Tuesday’s statement it would continue to follow government directives across the markets where it operates.  Last month, China said it would launch an investigation after two parcels sent via FedEx destined for Huawei addresses in Asia were diverted to the United States. FedEx said the packages were “misrouted in error.”  In the latest incident, technology news outlet PCMag said that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. FedEx returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a “U.S. government issue” with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.  FedEx’s lawsuit and Chinese anger over the deliveries come against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world’s two biggest economies.   Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of Commerce, said the lawsuit suggests “the company is caught in the middle between China and the U.S. They’re being squeezed by two governments that are annoyed at each other and they’re trying to do their business.”  Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru, Chris Sanders in Washington and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and Rosalba O'Brien",https://www.reuters.com/article/huawei-tech-ups-fedex/update-1-ups-will-not-join-fedex-lawsuit-against-us-government-idUSL4N23W4DZ,Business News,Reuters

Alessandra is already quite famous in Italy, where she’s been a politician for years. Her sympathies for (and even dabblings in) fascism are well-documented. She once abruptly left an Italian political party because its leader denounced fascism as the “absolute evil.” She was also a prominent face of Italy’s 1990 neo-fascist movement. There’s also the time in 2006 when she responded to a transgender critic who called her a fascist by saying: “Meglio fascista che frocio,” which roughly translates to “Better fascist than faggot.” Alessandra also appears to be a fan of President Donald Trump. She frequently retweets Trump and defended him against Carrey’s numerous political cartoons that target the president. Carrey even recently held an exhibit in New York depicting his work.

All bowls have conference tie-ins, but those are broken when conferences can't fill all of their slots. Here's a good look at the tie-in and selection process.

174,174,08-07-19 00:00,2019,7,8,"Makiko Yamazaki, Heekyong Yang, Ju-min Park",The high-tech trade dispute rooted in Japan's wartime history,"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan has tightened curbs on exports of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips to South Korea, upping the ante in a decades-old dispute with Seoul over South Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during World War Two.  The export curbs highlight how Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, continues to hold sway over a vital corner of the global supply chain. It remains a major player in specialized chip components, even though it was overtaken as a chipmaker years ago by South Korea.  Below are some details about the materials targeted, the companies involved, the outlook for further curbs and the row itself:  The tighter export curbs target three materials: fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays; photoresists, used to transfer circuit patterns on to semiconductor wafers; and hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips.  Japan produces about 90% of fluorinated polyimides and about 70% of etching gas worldwide, Japanese media have said. It produces around 90% of photoresists, according to a government report. That makes it difficult for South Korean chipmakers to find alternative sources of supply.  South Korea imported $144 million of the three materials from Japan in the first five months of this year, accounting for 94% of its fluorinated polyimides, 44% of its etching glass and 92% of its photoresist, Korean industry data showed.   A source at one of South Korea’s top memory chipmakers said chipmakers would have to try to build stockpiles.  South Korean tech giants such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and LG Display are all expected to be hit.  Japanese suppliers include JSR, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Shin-Etsu Chemical and Stella Chemifa. Other suppliers include Showa Denko KK and Kanto Denka Kogyo, analysts say.  South Korean chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix rely on Japan for most of the materials, although they source some hydrogen fluoride from China. They have up to four months of stockpiles for some of the materials, according to experts.  “The materials are hard to build stockpiles of because photoresists, for example, can deteriorate over time,” said Nomura analyst Shigeki Okazaki. Likewise, etching gas is hard to store in high volumes, he said.   Japan is stopping preferential treatment for shipments of these three materials to South Korea and will require exporters to seek permission each time they want to ship, which takes around 90 days, a government official said.  South Korean chipmakers are now seeking to buy more from elsewhere, such as China or Taiwan, where Japanese jurisdiction can’t reach, according to Park Jea-gun, a semiconductor engineering expert who heads the Korean Society of Semiconductor & Display Technology.  Japan also plans another round of export curbs for South Korea that could target a broader range of items applicable to weapons production, including machine tools, the government says.   Specifically, it plans to remove South Korea from a “white” list of countries with minimum trade restrictions, requiring Japanese exporters to go through a lengthy permit application process each time they want to export restricted items to South Korea, it said.  On Japan’s white list are 27 countries, from Germany to the United Kingdom and the United States. South Korea, which was added in 2004, would be the first country to be removed.  Tokyo has been frustrated by what it calls a lack of action by Seoul over issues stemming from a top South Korean court ruling last October that ordered another Japanese company, Nippon Steel, to compensate former forced laborers.  The neighbors share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including forced use of labor by Japanese companies and the use of comfort women, a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.  Japan says the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties.   South Korea has denounced Japan’s moves as a violation of World Trade Organization rules, saying it would take the necessary countermeasures, including filing a complaint.  Japan has said the moves are not in violation of WTO rules.

175,175,19-01-19 00:00,2019,1,19,Jibran Ahmad,Afghan Taliban reject talks with U.S. in Pakistan,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban rejected reports in the Pakistani media that they were prepared to resume meetings with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad and repeated their refusal to deal directly with the Afghan government.  Pakistani newspapers and television stations reported that a meeting in Islamabad was in prospect following discussions between Khalilzad and Pakistani officials including Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday.      Senior Taliban leaders said that regional powers including Pakistan had approached them and wanted them to meet the U.S. delegation in Islamabad and also include the Afghan government in the peace process but that the approaches had been rejected.  “We wanted to make it clear that we will not hold any meeting with Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement.  Talks between the two sides have stalled after the Taliban accused Khalilzad of straying from the agreed agenda and there is no clarity on when they may resume.  “We have made it clear again and again that we would never hold any meeting with the Afghan government as we know that they are not capable of addressing our demands,” said one senior Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The United States says any settlement in Afghanistan must be between the internationally recognized Afghan government and the Taliban, who have so far refused to talk to an administration they describe as an illegitimate puppet regime.  The Taliban leader said peace talks with the U.S. delegation could resume if they were assured that only three issues would be discussed - a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, an exchange of prisoners and lifting a ban on the movement of Taliban leaders.  Khalilzad arrived in Islamabad on Thursday and met Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other officials.   “The two sides reviewed developments post Abu Dhabi, in order to take the Afghan peace process forward,” a foreign office statement said. An Afghan Taliban delegation had a round of talks last month with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi.   The statement didn’t give any further details on the talks, but several local TV channels reported that Pakistan agreed to host the next round of talks between the Afghan Taliban and the United States in Islamabad.   Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by the Trump administration four months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace.  Washington has long been pushing Islamabad to lean on Taliban leaders, who it says are based in Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table.  It often accuses the south Asian nation of covertly sheltering Taliban leaders, an accusation Islamabad vehemently denies.  The United States, which had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at its peak during the first term of former President Barack Obama, withdrew most of them in 2014 but still keeps around 14,000 there.

176,176,02-10-16 17:24,2016,10,2,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,"Westworld starts with a bang, then devolves into an HBO rip-off of Lost","HBO doesn’t have as much riding on its new sci-fi drama Westworld as reports of the show’s calamitous production (which was suspended at one point and ultimately spanned more than a year, where most TV shows finish a season in a few months) might have you believe. Rating But, boy, it would be nice for the network if the show took off. HBO hasn’t launched a new drama hit since Game of Thrones in 2011, and its recent summer success story, The Night Of, was technically a miniseries, with nobody involved being in a rush to make a new installment. And there’s something even bigger at stake here. Now that The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones have proved that adaptations of much-loved horror and fantasy material could blow up into mega-hits, it’s only been natural to assume the same might be true of science fiction. If HBO can turn Westworld — based on Michael Crichton’s 1973 movie about a futuristic theme park that recreates the Wild West, then populates it with humanoid robots, some of whom go rogue — into the sci-fi Game of Thrones, the network will have lots of freedom in the years to come. That’s probably why it tried so very hard to get this one right. And with Jonathan Nolan — creator of CBS’s ingenious Person of Interest — and J.J. Abrams, who likely needs no introduction, involved behind the scenes, Westworld has all the advantages it needs. But the show is also indicative of just how much trouble HBO finds itself in in 2016. Here are five ways Westworld exemplifies HBO’s biggest strengths and problems. The Westworld pilot is good, good stuff. It builds nicely. It introduces some cool characters. It has some neat twists and turns. And it even takes a story you already know (the aforementioned 1970s film about a theme park full of killer robots) and tells it from a new perspective. In this case, the robots take center stage, where the theme park visitors were the heroes of the original. But with every new episode (of which I’ve seen four), Westworld loses a little bit more steam. There are still plenty of interesting things going on around the edges of the frame, but the series slowly but surely develops a severe identity crisis. Is it a story about oppressed people (the robots) rising up against those who oppress them (their creators)? Is it a revisionist Western? Is it a workplace drama about running a theme park in the future? Is it just a weird rip-off of Lost, with endless mysteries to solve? That it’s all of these things and more, without ever really committing to one of them, is the series’ chief failing. HBO increasingly creates shows that combine more and more and more things, in hopes they’ll hit on the magic formula that’s made Game of Thrones so successful. But Game of Thrones has two extremely compelling ideas at its center: 1) everybody wants to sit on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, and 2) the White Walkers are coming to kill everybody. Westworld doesn’t have those sorts of extremely compelling ideas. It has maaaaybe the suggestion that the robots will become sentient at some point down the line, and possibly the idea that the theme park employees are stand-ins for modern entertainment creators (more on that in a moment). But everything else is covered in layers of mystery and obfuscation that don’t help convey a story beyond ""Things are happening."" Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Dolores, one of the theme park’s ""Hosts"" (the artificial beings who populate the park), is giving one of the best performances on television, full stop. TV fans have known Wood was a tremendous actress since her work as a young teenager on the family drama Once and Again, which aired between 1999 and 2002 and where she found exactly the right emotional tug for every single scene she played. But Hollywood has struggled to find a project worthy of her talents since then. On Westworld, however, she’s mesmerizing. She modulates layers of emotion and levels of awareness and a slowly dawning sentience without ever once making you believe she’s anything other than an artificial intelligence. It’s magnificent work and the best reason to watch the show. The rest of Westworld’s cast is similarly stacked. There’s Anthony Hopkins as one of the men who created the Hosts. There’s Jeffrey Wright as another theme park employee, and Ed Harris as a mysterious gunslinger who roams Westworld’s wilderness and has a fixation on Dolores. Even the smaller roles are played by tremendous performers, as when the terrific Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen turns up in rather a minor supporting part. And because the series is an HBO project, its technical aspects are as good as TV gets. A directing team that includes Nolan, Neil Marshall (who’s helmed many of Game of Thrones’ most epic hours), and Vincenzo Natali (one of Hannibal’s chief directors) joins with top-notch cinematography that always highlights the alienness of Westworld to create something special. This is a fun show to look at, if nothing else. The Westworld pilot — without spoiling anything — backs the show into a corner it can’t really get out of. So instead of dealing with the episode’s most vital and interesting themes (particularly as pertains to the Hosts’ intelligence), the show instead spins out a bunch of pointlessly busy plot lines that feel like second-rate rip-offs of Lost. There are hidden clues and ominous portents and everything. And because Westworld insists on wrapping it all in the aforementioned layers of mystery, the show is constantly cutting between a bunch of storylines where it’s not immediately clear why anybody is doing anything, other than that the plot needs them to do certain things at certain times. One of HBO’s biggest problems in recent years is that it seems afraid of having any genuine protagonists. Instead, it creates massive, sprawling ensembles that feature lots and lots of potential protagonists. And when all of those potential protagonists have interesting things to do and compelling goals to pursue (as in Game of Thrones or The Leftovers), that approach can work. But in many cases, that much sprawl leads to a series that’s constantly leaping all over the place, without rhyme or reason. Westworld has a few noteworthy storylines, but it has even more that are hard to care about, simply because they seem to exist just to pad out the running time. Dolores is by far the most intriguing character on Westworld, but the show seems reticent to build a show around her, even though her character arc — robot slowly waking up to the horrors of her own existence — is an instantly compelling one. That’s not to say Westworld doesn’t contain anything to chew on. When it can get out of its own way, the series boasts a nicely heady mix of big ideas and sci-fi concepts. I was particularly struck by how much of the story is about the faith the characters have in learning the ""answers"" of Westworld. Even those who know this realm has been created by humans are certain there’s something more to find, some deeper revelation about the mysteries of consciousness. And for the Hosts, who spend their days executing preprogrammed routines, the slow realization of what reality truly is has even more to say about the relationship between creation and creator. There’s also a sly commentary in here on HBO itself. For the most part, the stories with the theme park employees are extraneous and unnecessary. (It’s not difficult to imagine an even more powerful story where Dolores or others discovered their ""makers"" late in season one.) But there’s frequent discussion of how visitors to the theme park want stories where every piece fits together in a satisfying fashion, or how everybody wants a little sex and violence in their entertainment. Thus these sections allow for an analysis of what we really want from our popular fiction — or what HBO thinks we want. We want things to make sense, but not be too satisfying. And we always respond best when characters are in pain. In recent years, HBO has struggled to select the point in the story where its big, serialized epics should begin. (To be fair, this is a common crisis in scripted TV.) Start too early, and you risk spending a lot of time on repetitive blandness. Start too late, and you run out of plot really quickly. As a movie that about robots waking up to their reality (in contrast to the human-centric focus of the original film), this new version of Westworld might have packed a punch. It would have been sort of a more serious, live-action version of the genre-hopping madness of The Lego Movie, with Evan Rachel Wood playing the role of the hero. But as a TV show, Westworld isn’t quite at a place where its story is moving forward, and the show knows it. The argument for Westworld’s story starting too late is in the attention it pays to its various theme park employees. As the employees learn that their robot creations are starting to understand that they are essentially slave labor, it’s easy to imagine this storyline as the end of a far longer narrative about humanity inventing its AI-driven successors, the beings that will replace it on the planet. But it’s also possible that Westworld opens way too early, at a point that should be buried in the back-story of a tale about the Host uprising, when the show presumably catches up to the killer robot shenanigans of the movie. Instead, we’re caught in a neither-here-nor-there scenario, and the show spends a lot of its time just laying everything out, hoping we’ll tag along because it’s on HBO, and we have brand loyalty to HBO. And to be honest, I do. I’ll keep watching for a little while. But even though it’s sleek, frequently thoughtful, and always cool, Westworld’s scattered self never coheres into anything. It’s a sci-fi Game of Thrones in that its many characters are spread all over the map, chasing after something grand, but it misses what made Game of Thrones work. Here, ""something grand"" is incredibly nebulous, a figment of someone’s imagination that might not even exist. We’re supposed to take on faith that the journey will be worth it. And while HBO still commands that amount of faith from most, it’s time to stop testing our patience.

177,177,30-06-19 00:00,2019,6,30,Martyn Herman,Teenager Gauff set for 'dream' debut against idol Venus,"LONDON (Reuters) - Of all the matches spread across the All England Club when Wimbledon begins on Monday none is more intriguing than the one scheduled for late afternoon on Court One between five-times champion Venus Williams and Cori Gauff.  Williams, at 39, is the oldest woman in the singles while fellow American Gauff, at 15, is the youngest ever to come through the qualifying tournament.  Gauff describes the draw as “a dream” and she might well wake up on Monday morning pinching herself, as this time last week she had no idea she would receive a wildcard into the qualifying tournament and was preoccupied with schoolwork.  After winning her third qualifying match to book her place in the draw, she revealed that her first memory of watching tennis on television was of Serena and Venus Williams who had won 10 Grand Slam titles before she was born.  Now ‘Coco’ as she is known will play against her idol in front of a packed showcourt crowd in a clash of the generations.  The level-headed teenager was taking it all in her stride though and if there were nerves as she practised at the weekend, she was hiding them well.  “I kind of felt like I was going to play one of them,” Gauff said. “Many people have been like ‘do you like your draw?’ — I love my draw. Playing one of the greatest players of all time is a dream — I’m excited to see how I do.”  Even 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena, who usually gets too nervous watching sister Venus, is intrigued.  “She’s so cool. She’s a great girl. I love her dad. They’re just really cool people,” Williams said on Saturday.  “It’s a great moment for her and for Venus. She’s playing against a player that actually reminds me of Venus. I think I might, might watch. I always get nervous watching Venus.”  Swiss great Roger Federer, whose management company Team 8 also looks after Gauff, is excited.  “I’m super happy for her. I saw the last couple of games when she qualified. Obviously everybody was waiting to see what the draw was going to be like. I think that’s fascinating, that she plays Venus now,” he said.  “It’s a great story. Coco is a nice girl, works really hard. I think she’s got a wonderful future ahead of her.”  Gauff, who won the French Open junior title aged 14, is coached by her father Corey who once played college basketball for Georgia State. Her mother Candi was a college gymnast.  “I feel blessed because my parents never put limitations on my goals,” Gauff said at Roehampton this week. “My parents always told me to shoot as high as I wanted to.”  Venus could be excused for feeling her age a little as she walks out to face a player 24 years her junior but Gauff does not regard her as old.  “I don’t think of Venus as old — she’s still killing the game right now,” she said.

Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin voiced this concern after Barr’s fiery testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday.  But there's little in the regulations that suggest Barr must recuse himself, or is even supposed to consider doing so, former prosecutors and legal experts told VICE News. READ more: Barr's defense of Trump is still baffling “Barr could put his foot on the brake for these Mueller referrals, and there doesn’t seem to be much Congress could do about it,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who specializes in the federal judicial system.  Barr’s track record of running interference for presidents under investigation — both now and 30 years ago — raises yet more questions about his impartiality in handling these additional cases. “Barr could put his foot on the brake for these Mueller referrals, and there doesn’t seem to be much Congress could do about it.” “Given what he’s said about the Mueller investigation, I think you really have to wonder about that possibility,” Tobias said.  Mueller’s probe looked specifically into Trump’s links to Russia and obstruction of justice. But his final report revealed that Mueller’s team uncovered evidence of criminal wrongdoing in 14 matters outside that scope that he referred to other officials.  Of the other matters Mueller raised the alarm on, 12 remain completely secret, having been turned over to other prosecutors or the FBI.  But one appears to directly implicate Trump: The case against Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, who violated campaign finance law on Trump’s behalf by setting up hush-money payments to women who claimed they’d had sex with Trump.  Cohen pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in jail for actions taken “at the direction of” Trump, according to both Cohen himself and written filings by federal prosecutors based in New York.  That matter is now under the supervision of Barr, who could, in theory, block any further investigative steps meant to expose Trump’s role in the payments.  The other investigation that’s public concerns Greg Craig, who served as former President Obama’s White House counsel and was charged this spring with lying to officials about work he did on behalf of the government of Ukraine. And Barr has the power to oversee other politically charged investigations beyond Mueller’s referrals — including the Southern District of New York’s investigation into whether any foreigners improperly donated to Trump’s inaugural fund.  Then there’s Erik Prince, founder of the private militia group Blackwater and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Prince was referred to the DOJ for possible perjury charges by the House Intelligence Committee in April after the committee announced it had uncovered six places where Prince’s testimony to Congress appeared to diverge from the findings of the Mueller report.  Barr could put his thumb on any of these, legal analysts say. And there doesn’t seem to be much that could technically stop him.  Yet if Barr weighs in too heavily on any of these investigations, he might spark a backlash from line prosecutors and others further down in the DOJ’s ranks, according former prosecutors like Gene Rossi, who spent 30 years as a DOJ employee in the Eastern District of Virginia. “Bill Barr has the authority, as the attorney general, to snuff out and stifle any investigation,” Rossi said. “But if he takes action seen as a gross abuse of power, you’ll see career prosecutors raise holy hell. They would not hesitate to leak, and tell the public that the big con is in.” That goes double for the Southern District of New York, which has a notable reputation for independence, Rossi said.  “If the attorney general tries to snuff out that [campaign finance] investigation, you’d probably see a revolt in Manhattan,” Rossi said.  When Barr appeared before the Senate on Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris of California pushed him to recuse himself from these cases based on what she called his conflict of interest.  “I think the American public has seen quite well you are biased in this situation and not objective, and that is the conflict of interest,” Harris said.  “Barr is fully within his rights not to recuse himself from the various investigations that spun off as a result of the Mueller probe.” Unfortunately for Harris, career prosecutors and legal experts said that’s not actually much of an argument.  “I can understand why people might feel that Barr has compromised his independence and ability to be fair in those cases based on the misleading nature of his letter, press conference and testimony before the Senate,” said Barbara McQuade, the former U.S. Attorney for Detroit. “But the standard that DOJ uses for recusal is whether the prosecutor has a financial, personal or political relationship with the subject of the investigation.” And there’s no indication Barr has any such relationship with any of these mystery investigations. Some argue Democrats’ calls for Barr to recuse from these matters are primarily political theater.  “Barr is fully within his rights not to recuse himself from the various investigations that spun off as a result of the Mueller probe,” said Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor. “Not only is there nothing to indicate any actual conflict of interest, but it is a stretch to argue there is even a perceived conflict involving these various cases each of which have their own facts, targets, and timelines.” Cover: Attorney General William Barr testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, May 1, 2019, on the Mueller report.

181,181,05-10-18 17:00,2018,10,5,Matthew Yglesias,"Family structure matters, but can we do anything about it?","Family structure matters. Murphy Brown is coming back on the air, and in the time since Dan Quayle lit into her, the evidence has become fairly overwhelming that kids raised in stable two-parent households do better than those raised by solo parents. Even more strikingly, a series of research projects led by Raj Chetty and his collaborators culminating in the Opportunity Atlas shows that this happens on a community level. Poor kids have a better chance of being upwardly mobile if they grow up in a low-poverty neighborhood. They have a worse chance of being upwardly mobile if they grow up in a racially segregated environment with no white people around. And they have a better chance of being upwardly mobile — regardless of their own family situation — if they grow up in a neighborhood with a lot of two-parent households. This impact is a lot stronger for boys than for girls, which makes me think it’s probably the same role model effect that the same team found for inventors: Girls are more likely to grow up to be successful innovators if they live in a city that has a disproportionately large number of women innovators. Except instead of girls benefitting from having adult women innovators ambiently present in their lived experience, boys benefit from having responsible, married dads ambiently around in their lived experience. It’s an interesting finding. David Leonhardt chides liberals for being reluctant to talk about it. I’m not totally averse to talking about it (after all, I am talking about it now) but I’m not really sure there’s a lot to be said about it. To me, the problem with the family structure conversation is it doesn’t seem to have a clear upshot. Research tells us that lead in soil and old paint hurts kids’ chances for upward mobility in life, and so the solution is to invest in lead abatement. Research tells us that kids do better when their parents get earned income tax credit money (EITC) and so the upshot is we should invest more in EITC. High-quality preschool and highly effective K-12 teachers help kids, so we should try to do more of that. One can go blah, blah, blah down the line and come up with a policy agenda that would do a lot to help America’s kids by bolstering their families’ incomes, improving the healthfulness of their ambient environment, and putting in the work to surround them with effective educational institutions. None of this is easy exactly, but some of it is at least logistically easy. (The hard part is politics.) And even the stuff that’s logistically hard, like building high-quality preschools, is at least clearly possible. On family structure ... I dunno. When I hear conservatives talk about the importance of family structure, what I mostly hear them doing isn’t articulating a policy agenda, but articulating opposition to a policy agenda. “No, let’s not bother with that lead abatement program or EITC expansion, the real problem is absent fathers.” On Twitter, Megan McArdle suggested to me that the fix for the family structure problem is for Hollywood to become moralistic and scoldy about unmarried parents and to valorize bourgeois conventionality. Maybe that would work, maybe it wouldn’t, but either way it’s not a policy agenda. It’s a kind of anti-agenda — very typical of contemporary American conservatism — that wants to fill the political arena not with policy ideas but with vague cultural grievances. To me that doesn’t work. The problems of poverty and economic growth are important enough that we should focus energy and attention on ideas that we have a strong reason to believe will work. When someone comes to me with a policy idea that stands a shot at meaningfully altering family structure, I’ll be happy to talk about it. But until then, I don’t think abstract talk does much good. As a last word, though, I did see some liberals Thursday afternoon doing the “correlation isn’t causation” routine on this finding of the study. We really do have a lot of studies on this subject, though, and they very much suggest a causal effect. What’s more, the causal mechanism is one liberals embrace in most contexts: representation matters. That’s why dads’ presence matters more for boys than it does for girls, and that’s why it matters on a community level and not just an individual one.

182,182,27-08-18 00:00,2018,8,27,,U.S. government to pay $4.7 billion in tariff-related aid to farmers,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday its farm aid package would include $4.7 billion in direct payments to farmers to help offset losses from retaliatory tariffs on American exports this season.  The bulk of the payments, $3.6 billion, would be made to soybean farmers. That amounts to $1.65 per bushel multiplied by 50 percent of expected production, Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation Bill Northey said on a conference call.   China has traditionally bought about 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports. But it has been largely out of the market since implementing tariffs on U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods.  “An announcement about further payments will be made in the coming months if warranted,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.   The aid package, announced at $12 billion in July, will also include payments for sorghum of 86 cents per bushel multiplied by 50 percent of production, 1 cent per bushel of corn, 14 cents per bushel of wheat, and 6 cents per pound of cotton.   Payments for hog farmers will be $8 per pig multiplied by 50 percent of Aug. 1 production, while dairy farmers will receive  12 cents per hundred weight of production, Northey said.  Sign-up for the program will begin on Sept. 4, to coincide with the 2018 harvest, and end in January. Farmers will need to present production evidence to collect payments and payments are capped at $125,000 per person.   The program will also include $1.2 billion in purchases of commodities, including pork and dairy products, to be spread out over several months, Undersecretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Greg Ibach said.   “The specific commodities to be purchased are those that have been impacted by the unfair tariffs that have been imposed by other nations,” he said.   The program will also include some $200 million for a trade promotion program to develop new markets.  The package has been seen as a temporary boost to farmers as the United States and China negotiate trade issues. It has divided Republicans, some of whom favor free trade and were troubled by what they viewed as the kind of welfare programs their party has traditionally opposed. It has also faced skepticism from some farmers, a key Trump constituency.  “Short-term aid does not create long-term market stability,” said Doug Schroeder, Illinois Soybean Growers vice chairman, in a statement after the announcement. “Producers need trade, not aid.”  Reporting by Michael Hirtzer, Caroline Stauffer and P.J.

183,183,25-05-16 14:00,2016,5,25,Sharonne Cohen,How RAM's Combination of Vodou Culture and Politics Became the Soundtrack to Haiti's Modern History,"All photos by Daniel Morel It's an interesting moment in the life of Richard Morse, a Haitian-American musician/proprietor/vodou priest living in Port-au-Prince. Haïti is still embroiled in election turmoil and ongoing social and political unrest, while his legendary band—RAM—just released its new album, fusing ceremonial Vodou rhythms with Haitian street music and electric guitars. I'm in Port-au-Prince, late January. The occasional whiff of smoke drifts up to my hotel balcony. Like all foreigners, I've been advised not to venture out for the next couple of days due to intermittent riots, burning tires, and unforeseeable chaos. The people are upset. And they're rising up. An undecided first round of elections last October, alleged to be fraudulent, set the political scene aflame. The term of President Michel Martelly—a.k.a. konpa singer Sweet Micky—ends on February 7, and Haïti, the first Caribbean nation to revolt against its colonizers, gaining independence in 1804, is expected to elect a new president. This is all very personal to Morse, quite literally; he is not only invested in the wellbeing of the nation and his people; he is also the estranged first cousin of and former advisor to Martelly, and a vocal critic of the powers that be, both within Haïti and abroad. Richard Auguste Morse was born in Puerto Rico in 1957 to a Haitian mother, then teaching and performing dance, and an American father, who was founding the Caribbean Studies program at the University of Puerto Rico at the time. Several years later the family moved to Woodbridge, Connecticut (both parents were Yale professors, in Drama and Latin American studies, respectively). Growing up mixed race was not easy. ""It took time for me to realize that I came from a mixed family,"" Morse muses. ""I didn't know. I asked my dad if it was true. It became more of an issue when I was a teenager in boarding school; I had heard rumors that I was of mixed race, because that's when you have to choose social camps."" Morse's next stop was Princeton, where he joined a Caribbean-style punk-rock band called Groceries. The band lived in Belle Mead, New Jersey (right outside Princeton), in a farmhouse converted into a rehearsal/living space after graduation. ""My musical education took place at CBGB's, Max's Kansas City, and a great new age/punk/rock club in Trenton, New York, called King Tut's City Gardens, where we became a house band, and played with UK bands like the Thompson Twins and Flock of Seagulls,"" he recalls. ""Removed"" from the band in 1984 for being ""an uncompromising artist,"" Morse moved to New York City, where he began working with Steve Rubell, of Studio 54 fame. ""I learned things from Steve Rubell... Most importantly, to infuse all that you do with art, business, and music,"" recalls Morse. In 1985, after a period of bohemian New York living, mingling with the likes of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, Morse wanted to get back into making music. Morse is actually a third-generation Haitian musician; Candio, his maternal grandfather, was a twoubadou (Kreyòl for troubadour, a singer-composer), and his mother, Emerante de Pradines, is an established singer, recording several albums of Haitian roots music in the 1950s (now 97, she is in the process of opening a music and arts school in Port-au-Prince). ""My mother sang the same songs we perform with RAM, but with an operatic voice and an acoustic guitar,"" says Morse. He'd always been fascinated with the music and culture of his motherland, and so at 28, he picked up and moved to Port-au-Prince, intending to explore the rhythms of Haitian roots music as a source of inspiration. Smitten with the music, the land, and its people—his people—Morse has been there ever since. Once in Haïti, Morse ""didn't know where to start."" Soon after arriving, the country went into political upheaval, and ruthless dictator “Baby Doc” Duvalier fled. ""The military took over, and there were a lot of shootings, things I'd never experienced before."" While immersing himself in Haitian culture and rhythms, ""an ongoing process that continues to this day,"" he had a dream: ""Someone came up to me and gave me a crazy message. I tried to investigate the dream once I woke up, and went to Jacmel [an old port town], where I met Madame Nerva, a renowned vodou priestess, who insisted I spend time with her."" The process of his initiation into vodou began, culminating in his ordination as a priest circa 2001. Back in 1987, Morse took over the lease for the legendary Oloffson, an enchanting but dilapidated hotel. His restoration efforts included staging art shows and hiring local traditional dance groups, finally choosing the one that would eventually become RAM. Morse fell in love with one of the singers, Lunise Exume; they married, had two children, and together still run the hotel, which has hosted numerous celebrities over the years, including Mick Jagger, Graham Greene, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis. The Oloffson is not only their home but the venue for RAM's electrifying Thursday night performances. With the official creation of RAM (Richard's initials) in 1990, Morse became the songwriter and Lunise began leading the female vocalists. Conceived as a roots band, influenced by the ""mizikrasin"" (roots music) movement that became popular in Haïti following Duvalier's exile, RAM combined ancient African rhythms, ceremonial vodou, and traditional folk music with rock 'n' roll. Incorporating traditional vodou lyrics and instruments (rara horns, petwo drums), and singing in Kreyòl, French, and English, it was a perfect combination. In its 26 years of existence, RAM has toured throughout Haïti and North America (including a concert with Arcade Fire). In 1993 RAM contributed to the Philadelphia soundtrack. ""Jonathan Demme was collecting Haitian art and doing Haitian documentaries at the time, did a Haitian compilation album. We had just completed our first recording, and I sent him a cassette. That's how it was in those days: cassette tapes. He loved the music and put it on the soundtrack,"" Morse explained. The fourth generation, Morse's son, William, recently joined the band. ""He grew up with RAM, and used to come on tour with us."" It was a natural progression for the young guitarist. Morse is politically outspoken, critical of Haitian, American and international powers, expressing his views openly on Twitter and other platforms. He resigned from his post as advisor to the President in December 2012, realizing Martelly was ""not on board,"" more interested in personal gain than in the recovery and well-being of his country. ""Do you ever feel you're in danger?"" I ask. ""I always get into trouble,"" he replies. ""I have political opinions. That can sometimes be a tipping point. But I try not to think about personal safety."" And there's the music itself. Some songs carry implicit political messages, such as ""Ambago"" (off RAM 1: Ayibobo), addressing the US embargo. ""Our songs are metaphors, not intrinsically political,"" explains Morse. ""People interpret the metaphors to be political. The first song that had political ramifications was ‘Fèy,’” recalls Morse. RAM added the instrumentation to the ceremonial lyrics and melody, and ""once it was released, it went from being a ceremonial song to a political song."" I ask if it was the people who made that leap. ""Yes,"" he says. ""And we suspected that they might."" The lyrics, paraphrased: I'm a leaf on a branch.A bad storm came and knocked me off the branch.The day I fall is not the day I die.And when they need me, where are they going to find me?. . .Papa, My Good Lord and Saint Nicholas,I only have one son, and they made him leave the country ""The people interpreted the bad storm as the military coup, and the leaf as [Haiti's first democratically elected president] Jean-Bertrand Aristide,"" explains Morse. ""There's no actual politics in the lyrics themselves, but when you put the words within the context of a coup d'état and throwing out a person beloved by the people... the connection was made."" Morse and the band paid a price for expressing political dissent, even if only implied. ""We received a lot of persecution and intimidation when that song became popular; there were rumors that I was machine-gunned to death, that my wife had been kidnapped. Military and police came into the hotel, and there were physical threats, coming in many different ways,"" he recalls. RAM just released its sixth and strongest studio recording, RAM 6: Manman m se Ginen. It's the first in ten years, mixed by Grammy-winning record producer Andrew Weiss. When I ask about the album's subtitle, Morse explains that ""in Haitian vodou, the heritage gets handed down from generation to generation, and the person it gets handed down to is a Ginen. My mother is a Ginen—an inheritor of this tradition."" And so is Morse. RAM 6 draws on the African culture and traditions that live on in Haïti; this diverse, compelling set features ancient texts (""Koulou Koulou"" is part of the traditional Haitian prayer ""La Priye Djô""), deities (the black top hat-wearing cemetery keeper and lord of death, healing and procreation on ""Mon Konpe Gede""), driving rhythms, traditional percussion and the distinctive sound of rara horns (check the opening ""Papa Loko (Se Van)"", celebrating the patron of healers and plants); but it also draws from other forms of popular Haitian music, mashing it up with a rock sensibility and electric guitars. Tradition is honored, preserved, and innovated all at the same time, uplifting the people during these troubled times. There's a long line of people waiting to get into the Oloffson and catch RAM live. I'm lucky enough to be in Port-au-Prince on a Thursday night and catch this sizzling 14-piece band in action. The night begins with a traditional vodou ceremony. Ten dancers dance to the same ceremonial rhythms that RAM will later make music to, presented as dance choreographies, without eclectic accompaniment. ""My mom did it throughout my childhood, singing and dancing to these rhythms"" recalls Morse. ""And now my wife does it, and I do it""—and so the tradition continues. Before the dancers begin, the ground is ""dusted"" with cornmeal, creating Veves—the spirits' ""coat of arms."" The ceremony has an entertainment aspect to it, ""but it's also educational,"" explains Morse. ""The more people know about the traditions, the more they enjoy the music. The more you find out about it, the deeper it gets."" Around midnight, the show begins. Morse's ponytail is let loose, his white mane unleashed, as are the spirits in the room. The music and palpable, infectious energy build, the rum flows, and the dance floor fills with sweaty, dancing, gyrating bodies, elated faces. RAM's shows draw not only hotel guests, but a wide spectrum of the country's political and racial groups, all sharing in this one-of-a-kind experience—hypnotic drums, transfixing horns, shredding guitars, riveting dancers. Spirits are soaring. Weeks later, back in North America, I catch up with Morse by phone. He is excited about the new RAM recording and its enthusiastic reception, and cautiously hopeful about the prospects of true Haitian democracy. There’s an interim government in place, working on forming an electoral council to organize the elections. “Martelly and the US State department want a second round to the first, but the population wants election verification, which might change the results. They're investigating all kinds of drug deals and irregularities, making Martelly and the US nervous,"" reports Morse. “This government appears to have good intentions, in spite of how it came into being.” And RAM is in the thick of it. “We've been around a long time. We're kind of the soundtrack for historical moments.” Cop RAM 6 here, and if you happen to be in Port-au-Prince on a Thursday night, you know where you need to be.

184,184,27-06-19 00:00,2019,6,27,Dave Graham,Mexico's president defiant in row with Canada over pipeline contracts,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pushed backed on Thursday against Canadian concerns that gas pipeline contracts awarded under his predecessor might not be honored, saying the terms of the agreements were “abusive” toward the state.  Mexican state power utility CFE [COMFEL.UL] said this week it would negotiate a “fairer” resolution to contractual disputes over several pipelines being built by companies including Mexico’s IEnova (IENOVA.MX) and Canada’s TC Energy Corp (TRP.TO).  The Canadian ambassador to Mexico, Pierre Alarie, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that the Mexican government appears “not to wish to respect natural gas pipeline contracts,” and said he was deeply concerned about the signal being sent.  Lopez Obrador, who in February vowed the contracts would be honored, said it was natural for Alarie to defend Canada’s interests but took a defiant stance when asked about the dispute during his regular morning press conference.  “Here it was stated that those contracts were abusive. I called them unfair contracts because they were handed over with all the benefits for the companies,” Lopez Obrador said, arguing that their terms would lead to the ruin of the CFE.  “A deal will be reached because we too have to defend the assets and the interests of the Mexican people,” he added.  The row has revived concerns that Lopez Obrador’s government could put in jeopardy contracts signed under previous administrations, the last six of which the president has characterized as part of a corrupt “neo-liberal” era.  He has been highly critical of the government of predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, who sought to lift economic growth by opening up the energy sector to private capital, an approach that Lopez Obrador has so far roundly rejected.    IEnova, a unit of U.S.-based Sempra Energy, says the CFE is seeking arbitration over a contract it signed in partnership with TC Energy to build a $2.5 billion pipeline from Texas to the Mexican Gulf coast port of Tuxpan.  News of the arbitration request dragged down IEnova’s shares more than 4% on Wednesday. The company’s stock at one point slumped by over 8% on Thursday. Shares in Sempra were down 1.1%, while stock of TC Energy was up slightly.  Paty Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sempra, said the company was analyzing the content of the arbitration request and its legal basis, reaffirming it was ready to talk to the CFE.  “The arbitration notice should not interfere with the existing contractual conditions,” she said.  A CFE source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the utility had notified Fermaca, a Mexican infrastructure company building another pipeline, that it was seeking arbitration. Fermaca could not immediately be reached for comment.  Separately, Mexico’s Grupo Carso, an infrastructure firm controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim that also is involved in the pipeline disputes, said in a statement it would analyze an arbitration request it had received from the CFE.  Shares in Carso fell by 2.25%.  Lopez Obrador rejected the suggestion that the spat could interfere with ratification of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new North American trade deal the Mexican Senate approved earlier this month.  Canada and the United States must still ratify USMCA.  Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, alarmed investors by canceling a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport, arguing that it was riddled with corruption.

191,191,14-11-16 17:15,2016,11,14,Catherine Chapman,What Does a Terrorist Look Like? This Controversial Sculpture Challenges Your Inner Bias," In a year that felt explosive, due to in no small part to violent attacks in a public spaces and further increases to surveillance technologies, Beijing-based artist Li Wei created Secure for Now, a sculpture that questions current global perceptions of safety. Composed of fiberglass and oil paint, the statue emulates a blonde-haired, blue-eyed child with his arms hidden behind him and a little white dog by his side. Viewed from the front, the boy looks calm but vacant, tricking viewers who fail to peek behind the sculpture and find the grenade cradled in his hands.  “From certain points of view, crisis is caused by humans,” Wei tells The Creators Project. “Personal crisis is a crisis, too, and it is often from [personal crises] that a public crisis actually originates. When personal turns into public, I think that is when the real crisis happens. It is in the many details of our human lives that the sparks of crisis lie hidden, but unfortunately most people cannot or do not want to see them.”  Following the attacks of September 11, Wei became a documentarian of similar catastrophes, from a fire in a Shanghai high rise in 2010, to the massacre at Paris' Bataclan last year. The parallels between these disasters, for Wei, whom The Creators Project profiled back in 2012, is the chaotic flow of information and its use as a springboard for paranoia, often manifested as adversity towards the Other. Wei plays with this notion in Secure for Now, arguing that a small boy and his dog are the least likely sources of threat, according to mainstream narratives. Within the work, the artist strives to change perceptions of disasters and their perpetrators.  “A crisis doesn’t care about borders, and it doesn’t care whether they are regarded as big or small,” Wei says. “It is hard to imagine that the relevance of a crisis should be measured simply by the number of casualties caused.” Another mode of measuring calamity, Wei notes, is through Facebook Safety Check, which the social media giant controversially rolled out during the 2015 Paris attacks, despite the service's intention to serve as a check-in during natural disasters.  “Users could confirm the location of themselves and other nearby users on Facebook, informing relatives and friends of their safety, at that time,” Wei says. “My cellphone was fiercely hot, like a freshly cooked pancake, informing me that a great number of people were 'secure for now.'""  In line with Facebook's decision to expand Safety Check to include acts of terror in its definition of emergency situations, as disasters of all kinds have occurred, public opinion of safety decreases, while the need to place blame increases each time.  Check out The Creators Project's documentary on Li Wei below:   Li Wei's first European exhibition took place at the Paris Asian Art Fair, which ran October 20–23. Secure for Now was also shown at the Artissima Art Fair in Torino, Italy from November 4–6. To see more of Wei's work, click here.

193,193,21-02-17 19:30,2017,2,21,Andrew Prokop,Today in Obamacare: why Republicans have a much tougher task than Obama did,"Members of Congress meeting constituents in their district this week are likely to encounter an unusual dynamic: Obamacare supporters who suddenly seem to outnumber the law’s opponents. The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin wrote this weekend about a new reality dawning on congressional Republicans: Constituents who dislike Obamacare are no longer anywhere near as vocal as they used to be, while the health law’s supporters are suddenly more energized than ever. Many have remarked on how this seems to be a mirror image of 2009, when the Tea Party became far more mobilized in opposition to Democrats’ health reform legislation than supporters were. And it’s also, of course, worth remembering that Democrats forged onward with health reform regardless of these prominent protests. But there’s also a crucially important difference between the two situations: The 2009 Democratic proposal planned to give out new benefits, while GOP proposals for Obamacare repeal today would instead put existing benefits at risk. In practice, the politics of those respective scenarios have tended to play out very differently. Yes, a new law giving people stuff — in the form of either new benefits or tax cuts — can be controversial and difficult to pass. Messing with the stuff people are already getting has tended to be exponentially more controversial, though, because it’s more actively harmful. Simply put, politicians of all stripes are more eager to go out on a limb to help their voters rather than to support something they believe will harm them. For a reminder of how this has worked, just think back to the last time Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress — from 2003 to 2006, under George W. Bush. Though GOP rhetoric has often focused on the need to cut spending, Bush had his greatest domestic legislative successes in his first term, when he focused on giving people stuff. Namely, he enacted two big rounds of tax cuts and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. None of those victories came easy — Republicans were forced to scale back their second round of tax cuts, and the final House vote on Medicare in 2003 was famously controversial. Still, all of them ended up passing in the end. But fresh off his reelection to a second term, Bush decided to make a bold proposal to overhaul the existing Social Security program by partially privatizing it. This did not end well for him. I recapped this story at greater length in an article back in January. Overall, though the defeat of Social Security reform had many elements — administration missteps, a unified Democratic opposition, and so on — the most important one is that the proposal, at its core, was about messing with the benefits people were already getting. Politicians looked for feedback from their constituents on Bush’s plan, and what they heard was so negative that even moderate red-state Democrats temperamentally inclined toward bipartisanship, like then-Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, decided the plan was a loser. By early February, New York Times reporter Robin Toner could report on “a general anxiety attack in the Republican center over Social Security.” Eventually, all the major players became convinced it couldn’t pass, and the centerpiece of Bush’s second-term domestic agenda was never even brought to a vote. Obamacare’s situation now isn’t a perfect parallel here. It’s a much younger program than Social Security, and there’s a stronger case that the exchanges may be in some trouble and in need of an imminent overhaul. Plus, Obamacare repeal has been the centerpiece of Republican messaging for years, whereas Social Security privatization was never more than a minor issue during the 2000 and 2004 campaigns. Still, as Martin’s story suggests, this GOP base enthusiasm may have ebbed, and it’s worth keeping the fate of Social Security reform in mind.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/21/14684934/obamacare-republicans-town-halls,,Vox

On Tuesday, Trump spontaneously invited reporters to sit in on a 55-minute meeting on immigration with congressional lawmakers from both parties. In the wake of Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by March, legislators have been scrambling to find a way to allow child immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization — known as “Dreamers"" — to stay in the country. The only problem? Trump apparently can’t stick to his own talking points. “What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive reform procedure?” California Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked the president. A “clean DACA bill” would protect Dreamers’ ability to stay in the country, without Republican-supported provisions such as increased border enforcement or money for Trump’s wall.  “Would you be agreeable to that?” the veteran Democratic senator pressed.

Kevin McCarthy leapt in to ask Trump “to be clear though” and remind him that “we have to have security.” It also, apparently, alarmed the White House, which released a transcript of the meeting — sans Trump's comment, as the Washington Post noted.  A White House official told the Post that the oversight, which has since been corrected in the official transcript, was unintentional. According to CNN, the meeting’s stenographer missed the line because too many people were talking at once.  This is not, however, the first time a White House transcript — which reporters and historians frequently consult — has been altered. During Anthony Scaramucci’s 11-day tenure as White House communications director, he said that Trump was capable of sinking “3-foot putts.” But in the transcript, New York Magazine pointed out, Scaramucci was quoted as saying that Trump can perform “30-foot putts.”",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/ne4qq7/trump-randomly-agrees-to-a-clean-daca-bill,,Vice News

197,197,18-03-18 00:00,2018,3,18,,Putin says 'nonsense' to think Russia would poison spy in Britain,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who are critically ill in a British hospital.  Britain has said that Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by the Soviet-era ‘Novichok’ nerve agent, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling it and investigating how such weapons could be used in assassinations.  But Putin, in his first detailed comments on the poisoning, said Russia had been falsely accused.  “As for the tragedy that you mentioned, I found out about it from the media. The first thing that entered my head was that if it had been a military-grade nerve agent, the people would have died on the spot,” Putin told reporters.  “Secondly, Russia does not have such (nerve) agents. We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international  organizations, and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises,” Putin said.  Despite the tensions, Putin said Moscow was ready to cooperate with London.   “... We are ready to cooperate, we said that straight away, we are ready to take part in the necessary investigations, but for that there needs be a desire from the other side, and we don’t see that yet. But we are not taking it off the agenda, joint efforts are possible.”  “As a whole, of course, I think any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish, drivel, nonsense, for Russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election. It’s just unthinkable.”  Putin was speaking after winning a new term in a presidential election.   British officials have said Moscow was culpable for the poisoning and expelled 23 Russian diplomats based in London.  Moscow retaliated on Saturday by expelling the same number of British diplomats from Moscow, shuttering the British consulate in Russia’s second city of St Petersburg and closing down the Russian activities of the British Council, which promoted British culture overseas.

198,198,25-06-19 00:00,2019,6,25,Melissa Fares,Wayfair employee walkout called over alleged furniture sales to U.S. migrant camp,"(Reuters) - Wayfair Inc came under pressure on Tuesday after hundreds of employees were reported to be planning a walkout over the retailer’s alleged sale of more than $200,000 in bedroom furniture for a Texas detention facility for migrant children.  Shares of the company fell 5.3% to $144.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.  A Twitter account under the handle @wayfairwalkout, created this month with a following of more than 13,000 including high-profile Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called for the work stop on Wednesday.  Wayfair, headquartered in Boston, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The @wayfairwalkout account referred Reuters to the company and Reuters was not able to confirm it was created by Wayfair employees.  Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter: “I stand with hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for.”  An image of a letter to Wayfair leaders from employees said that an order for more than $200,000 of bedroom furniture was destined for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas that would house migrant children seeking asylum.  Criticism has mounted this week over the detention of  migrant children in overcrowded, squalid conditions.  “In response to a recent letter signed by 547 employees, our CEO said that the company would not cease doing business with contractors furnishing border camps,” @wayfairwalkout  tweeted.  It demanded that Wayfair stop selling to migrant detention camps and that it give profits, which they claim amount to $86,000, to a Texas-based non-profit agency offering legal services to immigrants.  Screenshots on Twitter of a letter to employees that said it was from the retailer’s “leadership team” read, “...We believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate.”  The walkout, scheduled to take place on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. ET in Boston’s Copley Square, is the latest example of employees protesting workplace social issues.   In June 2018, Alphabet Inc’s Google faced internal upheaval over a contract to help the U.S. military analyze aerial drone imagery.   The hashtag “#wayfairwalkout” was top trending in the United State on Twitter as of Tuesday evening.   “Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez. “They asked the company to stop. CEO said no.

199,199,16-04-18 19:20,2018,4,16,Dylan Scott,3 red states could put Medicaid expansion on the ballot this year,"Medicaid expansion is back on the ballot. Organizers in Utah submitted signatures on Monday to put an initiative expanding Medicaid on the state’s ballot in November. They got 165,000 signatures, or about 50,000 more than they needed. State legislators are actually pushing a limited form of Medicaid expansion, but, as we covered before, the Trump administration seems unlikely to greenlight that proposal. The ballot initiative being submitted today would be a clean version of expansion. Medicaid expansion would cover about 150,000 low-income people in Utah, one of 18 mostly Republican-led states to refuse to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A recent poll by the Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah found 62 percent of Utah voters support the ballot initiative. ”People want more health care — not less,” Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a left-leaning economic justice group that is helping support the initiative, said in a statement. “They are done with politicians who are not addressing their top concerns, and they are taking action to do something about it.” Last year, Maine became the first state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, though its Republican governor is doing what he can to stop it. Utah could be the next — and signatures are being gathered in several other red states to try to finally push through Medicaid expansion. Organizers are also hoping to put initiatives on the ballot in Idaho and Nebraska. It has been a slow grind to push the holdout states to expand Medicaid — some 4 million Americans have been left without insurance as a result — but this fall, voters will have a chance to make significant strides toward the nationwide expansion that the ACA originally envisioned. In Idaho, organizers have an April 30 deadline to submit about 56,000 signatures. The Fairness Project told me they “will significantly exceed that number.” Medicaid expansion would cover about 62,000 people in the Potato State; a 2017 survey found that 70 percent of Idahoans said they supported closing the state’s coverage gap, though it didn’t ask about the Medicaid expansion explicitly. (Here’s a good piece from BuzzFeed’s Anne Helen Petersen about the health care politics there.) In Nebraska, the deadline for submitting signatures for a ballot initiative is July 6; organizers said that the campaign was “on track” to gain the 85,000 signatures that they need. Medicaid expansion would cover nearly 90,000 people in the state. (The Fairness Project is also helping to support a signature drive in Montana. The state has already expanded Medicaid, but the expansion would end in 2019 unless it is reauthorized. It has covered about 90,000 people in the state.) The prize turkeys for Medicaid expansion will always be Texas and Florida, where serious ballot initiative campaigns have yet to be mounted. And, as we have seen in Maine, voters approving Medicaid expansion doesn’t mean things will go smoothly if there are intransigent state officials. Still, Medicaid notched some big wins at the polls last year — in Maine and in Virginia, where Democrats won huge victories campaigning on the issue and may soon approve expansion as a result — and it will get another shot in a few months.

201,201,15-05-18 00:00,2018,5,15,"Tommy Wilkes, Guy Faulconbridge",Thomson Reuters to move forex derivatives to Dublin due to Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp said on Tuesday it would transfer its $300 billion-a-day foreign exchange derivatives trading business to Dublin from London ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union next year.  Major electronic bond and forex trading platforms have announced plans over the past year to shift their trading businesses out of London ahead of Brexit in March 2019, with most of Thomson Reuters’ rivals opting for Amsterdam.  Thomson Reuters has applied to the Irish central bank to move its foreign exchange Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) to Dublin so that it can continue to sell into the EU’s single market, the company said in a statement.   It intends to transfer all “existing client relationships of the Thomson Reuters MTF and Dealing, as well as Fixed Income Callouts and Auctions, from RTSL to our new Irish legal entity ahead of the Brexit date.”  Neill Penney, the company’s co-head of trading, said there were no plans to move staff from London but that some new personnel would be hired in Dublin.  He said Thomson Reuters had opted for Dublin over Amsterdam because it was the most cost-effective, would “minimize disruption for clients” and because Dublin’s growing role as a center for financial technology and research would “open a number of doors” should the company want to expand.    “It doesn’t matter for our customers which European city we are in ... From a technology front, the technology is remaining where it is, which is in London and New York,” he said.  All spot forex trading, where its volumes top $100 billion a day, would remain in London, as would its post-trade services.  Thomson Reuters runs one of the world’s largest trading platforms in the $5 trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market.  Even if only the legal entity, the departure of any part of a currencies trading business will be a blow to London. Foreign exchange trading remains the crown jewel of the city’s financial services industry with volumes traded in the city far surpassing its nearest rival.   Big banks and trading platforms compete on speed when trading forex and invest heavily in cutting edge technology in London.  While trading platforms - or even some of the dealers themselves - head elsewhere after Brexit most of the hardware is likely to remain in London because of the high-speed sub-Atlantic cables linking it to New York.  Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Nex Group have chosen Amsterdam as their EU hub for their trading units, media have reported.   Bonds platform Tradeweb, in which Thomson Reuters has a stake, also announced plans to move to Amsterdam, a city that hosts many of the fast-moving algorithmic trading businesses active in FX and fixed income markets.   Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News.  Its forex business is part of the trading operations being bought by private equity giant Blackstone.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads While attempting to type some inane email in It is as if you were doing work, pop-up windows proclaiming “Success is no accident” and “No one ever drowned in sweat” kept interrupting my text. Then there were the incessant buttons to click, documents to send, and other mildly irritating tasks, all as I worked towards the next promotion. The recently released game, created by Pippin Barr, is a simulation of office work using late ’90s Windows sound and visuals, set in a near future where robots have taken on the real labor. The game “poses as an application that humans who have been put out of work by robots and AI can play as a way to recapture the sense they once had of doing work and being productive,” Barr, an assistant professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montréal, writes in a release. “It’s a kind of semi-condescending service offered by this new world to those of us who can’t deal with it.”  It’s also a sadly accurate simulation of many offices, where attempts to get work done are constantly derailed by work motivation, whether meetings, messages, emails, or just a particularly aggravating motivational poster. Barr often experiments with game structures for unconventional play, such as his digital take on Marina Abramović’s “The Artist Is Present,” and the v r 3 museum of rendered water launched earlier this year. Players begin It is as if you were doing work as a lowly “Screen Administrator,” before progressing through meaningless tasks and some enforced “breaks” to play Breakout, and being promoted to titles like “Big Data Administrator.” You’re rewarded with perky sound effects and pop-up windows, yet the job always stays the same. The only things you can change are your desktop backdrop (a cat and a photograph of a messy desk being options) and the looping MIDI music, including a “world” selection that has a grating pan flute accompaniment. It is, needless to say, rather depressing. Alice O’Connor, who shared the game on Rock Paper Shotgun, notes that it’s not too far from reality, as there are fake companies in France run as real offices for the unemployed to get workplace training. Other games have similarly pondered the office in an automated future, including Owlchemy Lab’s VR Job Simulator (Kotaku made a list of 10 games that simulate office jobs). And Barr’s creation evokes some of the irony in games such as the Sims, where the mechanics involve mundane life actions like microwaving a ramen cup or reading a newspaper’s “help wanted” ads. Increasingly, performative office communications like Slack basically turn the workspace into a large-scale RPG, or at least add more digital noise to the desktop. It’s possible to imagine a future where that element of distraction becomes the job itself.

203,203,29-10-18 19:56,2018,10,29,Manisha Krishnan,Canada May Not Have Enough Legal Weed for a Year,"This article originally appeared on VICE Canada. Dan Sutton is blunt about why he thinks licensed producers in Canada don’t have enough legal weed to supply demand right now. “Most of these guys they’ve been wearing pinstripe suits their whole career. They’ve never spent any time on a farm and they don’t know shit about agriculture,” Sutton, founder of British Columbia-based licensed producer [LP] Tantalus Labs, told VICE. While sales following legalization on October 17 were reportedly massive in some provinces—one chain in Alberta claimed it made $1.3 million [$1 million USD] in five days—weed’s popularity is a bit of a double-edged sword due to supply issues. Several stores have already run out of stock and are having difficulty ordering more cannabis; ditto for online sales on various provincial government websites, where many products are labeled “out of stock.” Even on the medical side of things, licensed producers such as industry giant Tilray and CannTrust, are low on flower for patients. Legalization has been years in the making in Canada, so why don’t we have enough weed? Sutton told VICE part of the problem is licensed producers are largely run by people who don’t have a background in farming or cannabis. He believes publicly traded LPs have hyped up their growing ability in the media to sell stocks, and that “analysts, regulators, bankers—everyone started drinking the Kool-Aid.” But he doesn’t think LPs are anywhere close to mastering how to mass produce decent quality cannabis. “Most licensed producers still have no idea how to cultivate cannabis in a repeatable way,” he said. He noted Tantalus Labs, which operates a 75,000 square-foot-grow, took two years to design its greenhouse and another two to build it. But he says others in the industry have set up facilities within months, which he doesn’t think is enough time to ensure they are running optimally. Sutton said there are two types of master growers in the industry: Those who came over from the black market and have a deep understanding of the cannabis plant but were likely running lots of smaller grows, and master growers who come from an industrial agriculture background not specific to cannabis. “The cannabis plant presents unique challenges in that it’s very susceptible to crop loss. Tomatoes wouldn’t have the same risk profile,” he said. Sutton said cannabis is a sensitive plant that’s difficult to control without pesticides—which is what Health Canada requires. Over or under irrigating, misusing nutrients, powdery mildew, root rot, and botrytis (bud rot) are all things that can ruin the crop. The institutional knowledge needed to reliably grow massive amounts of cannabis simply doesn’t exist, he said, and the industry won’t figure it out for a while. “We will not see anything close to equitable supply relative to demand in the next 18 months,” he said. “It will result in the collapse of some of these big companies on the stock market.” Jordan Sinclair, vice president of communications for Canopy, the largest legal weed producer in the world, told VICE he disagrees with that assessment. “I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that LPs aren’t set up to do it. Maybe that person’s LP isn’t set up to do it,” he said. Sinclair told VICE there are a number of factors contributing the supply issues, including larger than anticipated demand, logistical issues in getting product onto store shelves, and yields that are still a few months away from being harvested. Canopy has more than 2.4 million square feet of growing space.  “The reality is we’ve been expanding over the last year, but some of the expansions will only be mature or producing at full capacity over the next few months,” Sinclair said, noting he thinks things will stabilize in the next month or so.  Rosalie Wyonch, an analyst with C.D. Howe Institute, a non-profit research firm, told VICE that Canada’s legal weed supply is only likely to meet 30 to 60 percent of demand for at least a year. But Wyonch said a variety of factors are at play, and “no one is completely guilty and no one is completely innocent.” Wyonch said the federal government via Health Canada may not have approved enough LP licenses in time for legalization. Though they sped up that process more recently, it may have been too little too late, she said. Based on LP’s inventories and what they’d been selling historically, it was clear there would be a shortage, Wyonch told VICE. However, “if you took the LPs at their word of what their production could be in the future, it’s a massive oversupply.” Provinces are the wholesalers of weed across Canada, and Wyonch said they are responsible for securing enough weed, which they may not have done. Quebec, in particular, only secured half of what demand would be, she said. On Friday, Quebec announced its government-run stores will only be open four days a week due to a shortage of supply. But some LPs have also failed to deliver on what they’ve agreed to supply. Sutton told VICE that issue could explain why LPs are short on medical cannabis. “If you miss your obligations to your distributor, you’re in big trouble,” he said. “The truth is there’s a huge incentive for LPs to supply distributors before they supply medical patients and as a result, these medical patients are getting the short end of the stick.” Longtime cannabis advocate Tracy Curley told VICE the supply for patients has run dry. As of Wednesday last week, she said Tilray was only offering one strain of flower.  “I took a look at eight LPs. I managed to find five strains of flower,” she said, noting some higher THC strains are being transferred from the medical supply to the rec market. While LPs can potentially make more money per gram selling to patients, Curley said strict advertising regulations mean LPs need to get their weed into provincial stores in order to gain brand recognition. Reached by VICE, Tilray, which had a market cap as high as $20 billion [$15.2 billion USD] in September but has seen its stock drop by about half since its record high, said it expects to have more flower and oil varieties available “soon.” “We have received an unusually high volume of orders on Tilray medical cannabis products this month. In anticipation of a potential stock-out of whole flower, we proactively informed patients of this temporary supply interruption which resulted in an additional high volume of orders on oil and capsule varieties, as well,” said Tilray spokeswoman Chrissy Roebuck.  CannTrust, which was also out of flower for medical patients as of Friday, told VICE it is “working hard to fix this urgently” and had increased the number of third-party testing labs it works with in order to restock more quickly. Wyonch told VICE the supply shortage amounts to part of the growing pains of legalization. In the meantime, she said it will take years to eliminate the black market—one of the primary goals the government has cited for legalization cannabis.  “LPs basically need to grow as much weed as possible,” and the government shouldn’t stand in their way, she said.

204,204,12-07-18 17:24,2018,7,12,Jordan Pearson,Canadian Telecoms Make the Most Money on Mobile Data in the World,"Unfortunately for Canadians, the evidence just keeps piling up that compared to the rest of the world, they’re getting a raw deal on data.  Canadians have some of the lowest mobile data usage in the world, and the slowest uptake for data usage—but telecoms in the country make the highest profits for data plans, according to a new report.  Telecom analysis firm Tefficient looked at data usage per SIM card (i.e., per individual phone) across 36 countries in 2017 and found that people in just five countries use less data than Canadians: Greece, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, and the Czech Republic. Canadians on average used just 1.3 GB of mobile data per month in 2017. Even worse, data usage in Canada grew just six percent last year—the lowest rate of growth in the world, according to Tefficient’s report. US operators also extract a high rate of profit per gigabyte used, but less than Canadian telecoms, according to the report. Americans also used more data per month: 3.3 GB on average. Countries where telecoms made less revenue per gigabyte of mobile data had more mobile data usage and higher uptake—telecoms in India, for example, made the lowest revenue per gigabyte and the country had a 300 percent growth in data usage last year. According to Tefficient, telecoms in Canada make 35 times more profit on data than Indian telecoms.  A winning strategy for telecoms is to be more generous with data plans and accept a mid-range of revenue per gigabyte of data used, the report suggests. But that’s unlikely to happen. Canada’s telecom industry is notoriously moribund, with just three established players making up a kind of oligopoly that account for the vast majority of mobile subscriptions in the country—Rogers, Bell Canada, and Telus. It’s one of Canada’s many curious ironies that a company headquartered in Toronto runs a successful affordable mobile phone service in the US—Ting by Tucows—but has thus far been unable to operate in its home country.  When reached for comment, spokespeople for Rogers and Bell Canada directed Motherboard to the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Organization.  ""The report make comparisons using data from different sources that use different methodologies,"" said a CTWO spokesperson. ""This calls into question its conclusions, which appear to understate data usage and overstate revenues per GB in Canada, but it is also important to note when speaking about revenues, according to the OECD, Canada leads among all G7 countries in investment as a percentage of revenue and is the fourth highest among all OECD nations.""  Spokespeople for Telus were not immediately available. It’s this lack of choice, and the high prices Canadians pay for data, that makes hating on telecoms a third national sport behind hockey and lacrosse.

205,205,17-10-17 22:23,2017,10,17,Kurt Wagner,Twitter’s new user rules crack down on nudity and ‘unwanted sexual advances’,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promised on Friday that the company would soon implement sweeping changes to better protect users from abuse and harassment. We now know what some of those changes are. In an email sent to Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, the company outlined a few policy updates that will be “rolling out in the weeks ahead.” Among them: A tougher stance on “non-consensual nudity,” or images or videos shared without the subject’s permission. Twitter has issued a broader definition of “non-consensual nudity” — it now includes “upskirt imagery, “creep shots” and hidden camera content” — plus harsher penalties for those who share this content. Instead of a temporary account suspension, first-time offenders will be permanently suspended. Twitter is also making it easier for people to report what it calls “unwanted sexual advances.” Previously, an unwanted sexual advance had to be reported by users directly involved in the situation. Soon, Twitter bystanders will also be able to report this kind of behavior. There are still a lot of other issues Twitter needs to work out. Under categories like “hate symbols,” “violent groups” and “tweets that glorify violence,” Twitter just includes a simple sentence: “More details to come.” Twitter has been dealing with abuse on its platform for years. Many believe that it’s the company’s biggest issue. Dorsey’s pledge to revamp Twitter’s user guidelines came after some users boycotted Twitter for suspending actress Rose McGowan, who was speaking out against film producer and alleged sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. “Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we’re *still* not doing enough,” Dorsey tweeted. “We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them.” A Twitter rep said the company plans to unveil more details about the updated guidelines soon. The changes outlined in the email are not final and could still change, but Twitter is clearly cracking down. Here’s the email in full. It was first reported by Wired. Dear Trust & Safety Council members, I’d like to follow up on Jack’s Friday night Tweetstorm about upcoming policy and enforcement changes. Some of these have already been discussed with you via previous conversations about the Twitter Rules update. Others are the result of internal conversations that we had throughout last week. Here’s some more information about the policies Jack mentioned as well as a few other updates that we’ll be rolling out in the weeks ahead. Non-consensual nudity Current approach * We treat people who are the original, malicious posters of non-consensual nudity the same as we do people who may unknowingly Tweet the content. In both instances, people are required to delete the Tweet(s) in question and are temporarily locked out of their accounts. They are permanently suspended if they post non-consensual nudity again. Updated approach * We will immediately and permanently suspend any account we identify as the original poster/source of non-consensual nudity and/or if a user makes it clear they are intentionally posting said content to harass their target. * We will do a full account review whenever we receive a Tweet-level report about non-consensual nudity. If the account appears to be dedicated to posting non-consensual nudity then we will suspend the entire account immediately. * Our definition of “non-consensual nudity” is expanding to more broadly include content like upskirt imagery, “creep shots,” and hidden camera content. Given that people appearing in this content often do not know the material exists, we will not require a report from a target in order to remove it. While we recognize there’s an entire genre of pornography dedicated to this type of content, it’s nearly impossible for us to distinguish when this content may/may not have been produced and distributed consensually. We would rather error on the side of protecting victims and removing this type of content when we become aware of it. Unwanted sexual advances Current approach * Pornographic content is generally permitted on Twitter, and it’s challenging to know whether or not sexually charged conversations and/or the exchange of sexual media may be wanted. To help infer whether or not a conversation is consensual, we currently rely on and take enforcement action only if/when we receive a report from a participant in the conversation. Updated approach * We are going to update the Twitter Rules to make it clear that this type of behavior is unacceptable. We will continue taking enforcement action when we receive a report from someone directly involved in the conversation. Once our improvements to bystander reporting go live, we will also leverage past interaction signals (eg things like block, mute, etc) to help determine whether something may be unwanted and action the content accordingly. Hate symbols and imagery (new) * We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, hateful imagery, hate symbols, etc will now be considered sensitive media (similar to how we handle and enforce adult content and graphic violence). * More details to come. Violent groups (new) * We are still defining the exact scope of what will be covered by this policy. At a high level, we will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause. * More details to come here as well (including insight into the factors we will consider to identify such groups). Tweets that glorify violence (new) * We already take enforcement action against direct violent threats (“I’m going to kill you”), vague violent threats (“Someone should kill you”) and wishes/hopes of serious physical harm, death, or disease (“I hope someone kills you”). Moving forward, we will also take action against content that glorifies (“Praise be to <terrorist name> for shooting up <event>. He’s a hero!”) and/or condones (“Murdering <x group of people> makes sense. That way they won’t be a drain on social services”). * More details to come. We realize that a more aggressive policy and enforcement approach will result in the removal of more content from our service. We are comfortable making this decision, assuming that we will only be removing abusive content that violates our Rules. To help ensure this is the case, our product and operational teams will be investing heavily in improving our appeals process and turnaround times for their reviews. In addition to launching new policies, updating enforcement processes and improving our appeals process, we have to do a better job explaining our policies and setting expectations for acceptable behavior on our service. In the coming weeks, we will be: * updating the Twitter Rules as we previously discussed (+ adding in these new policies) * updating the Twitter media policy to explain what we consider to be adult content, graphic violence, and hate symbols. * launching a standalone Help Center page to explain the factors we consider when making enforcement decisions and describe our range of enforcement options * launching new policy-specific Help Center pages to describe each policy in greater detail, provide examples of what crosses the line, and set expectations for enforcement consequences * Updating outbound language to people who violate our policies (what we say when accounts are locked, suspended, appealed, etc). We have a lot of work ahead of us and will definitely be turning to you all for guidance in the weeks ahead. We will do our best to keep you looped in on our progress. All the best, Head of Safety Policy This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2017/10/17/16492234/twitter-user-guidelines-update-nudity-harassment,,Vox
206,206,16-03-16 14:50,2016,3,16,Dara Lind,Trump delegates in Illinois with “Muslim-sounding” names didn’t do as well as white ones,"Donald Trump won the Illinois primary last night. But he didn't get as many delegates as he could have — and it might be because his supporters were averse to voting for people with the last names Sadiq and Fakroddin. Raja Sadiq and Nabi Fakroddin both ran as delegates for Trump in Trump-friendly districts. And because of Illinois's strange voting rules, both their names were on the ballot as well as Trump's. But while Trump carried both districts Tuesday, both Sadiq and Fakroddin got many fewer votes than other delegates (with European-sounding names) running under the Trump banner. And in Fakroddin's case, at least, it kept him — and the Trump campaign — from winning a delegate slot. We don't know the exact reason for Sadiq and Fakroddin's underperformance, which was first noticed by elections analyst Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. And it's unlikely to alter the fate of the 2016 election — it looks like it only swayed the result in one race, keeping Fakroddin from winning a slot at the convention alongside the other two Trump delegates in his district. But if it's true that Trump voters allowed anti-Muslim sentiment to override their loyalty to the candidate, that's a bad sign for the Trump campaign — a sign that it still might not understand or be able to control the Islamophobia it's unleashed. To understand how this happened, you need to understand how the Illinois GOP primaries work. In most primaries, voters vote directly for a candidate. Then if the candidate receives enough votes, delegates who are pledged to that candidate are selected to go to the party convention. In Illinois, it's a little different. Fewer than a quarter of the state's delegates are assigned to whichever candidate gets the most statewide votes. For the rest, voters vote directly for delegates themselves. Each presidential campaign runs a slate of delegates pledged to that candidate in each congressional district. Each delegate is listed on the ballot alongside the name of the candidate he or she is pledged to, and voters pick a certain number of delegates from each district (usually three). So a voter yesterday who liked both Donald Trump and John Kasich could vote for two of Trump's delegates and one of Kasich's. As it turns out, plenty of congressional districts split their delegates. According to the Green Papers, Trump swept the delegate slots in nine districts (out of 18), and Ted Cruz and Kasich each swept 1. But in the other seven districts, voters selected two delegates from one campaign and one delegate from another. So split-ticket voting isn't that unusual. But there's still reason to believe something weird happened with the two Trump delegates with ""Muslim-sounding"" names. Here's why. Nabi Fakroddin has some history in Illinois state politics. He was appointed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to the Illinois Human Rights Commission; he was also on the Regional Transit Authority but had to resign rather than serving on both commissions at once. He ran as a Trump delegate in Illinois's sixth congressional district, in the western suburbs of Chicago. But he only got about five votes for every six that the other two Trump-pledged delegates received. And that was enough to cost him the third delegate slot in the district: In the 13th congressional district, which includes Champaign, the split is a little less clear. Only one of Trump's delegates cracked the top three there; neither Raja Sadiq, who's a family physician and longtime Republican donor, nor fellow Trump delegate Toni Gauen made the cut. But the gap between Gauen, in fifth place, and Sadiq in sixth was as big as the gap between the first-place Trump delegate and Gauen. Sadiq only got 85 percent of the vote total Gauen got, and only 75 percent of the votes that leading Trump delegate Doug Hartmann got. We genuinely do not know why Sadiq and Fakroddin got fewer votes than their fellow Trump delegates. The only evidence we have that they were discriminated against because of their names is, well, the names themselves — and the vote totals. But in a primary where two-thirds of Republican voters said that Muslims should be banned from entering the US — a policy position first advanced by Donald Trump — Islamophobia is definitely running high. And there is at least a possibility that the fears of Muslims that Trump's campaign has helped stoke are powerful enough, at least in some fraction of Trump supporters, that even seeing the name ""Trump"" next to a name that sounds foreign isn't enough to win those voters' support.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/16/11244884/trump-delegates-muslim-fakroddin,,Vox

208,208,29-06-18 00:00,2018,6,29,"Christine Murray, Stefanie  Eschenbacher",Anti-corruption watchdogs wonder: 'Who is funding Mexico's presidential candidates?',"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s three leading presidential candidates have not declared a single peso in direct private financial contributions to their election campaigns, federal records show, raising concerns from corruption watchdogs about the potential influence of dark money in a pivotal contest.  Candidates from Mexico’s three main political parties said they have relied almost exclusively on money from their parties, which is overwhelmingly public, to bankroll their campaigns, a total of more than 634 million pesos ($32.1 million).   That is according to the most recent declarations they have filed with the National Electoral Institute, known as INE.  Mexicans head to the polls on July 1 to elect their next president in what has been a highly anticipated and hard-fought contest. According to the candidates’ filings, not one of the country’s nearly 90 million registered voters made a monetary contribution directly to their campaigns, and just 70 people have given a total of around 1.4 million pesos ($70,897) of in-kind goods or services.  By law, Mexican parties must rely on public funding for the majority of their financing. Private donations are tightly regulated and have never played an important role in modern campaigns – at least not the modest sums typically declared to federal election authorities. In reality, large, clandestine contributions and illegal vote buying have factored into Mexican elections for decades, corruption watchdogs say.  The latest figures reported to INE strain credibility and underscore the difficulty of cleaning up Mexico’s campaign finance system, said Max Kaiser, an authority on anti-graft initiatives at the nonprofit Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.  “Until we stop this cycle, we won’t be able to control corruption in Mexico,” Kaiser said.  The presidential campaigns of Jose Antonio Meade, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, and Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party or PAN, both said their public funding was sufficient, so they did not need private money. Representatives for the two candidates said there has been no under-reporting of private donations or campaign spending.  A representative for the frontrunner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, running for the MORENA Party, did not respond to a request for comment.  (Meet Mexico's 2018 presidential candidates: tmsnrt.rs/2MVhfjA)  The federal election agency INE regulates campaign finance. INE board member Ciro Murayama said he found nothing unusual in the candidates’ declarations that they have not taken any private money.  “If someone doesn’t believe it, they have to demonstrate it,” Murayama said in an interview. “If someone thinks something, the burden of proof is on that person.”  But Luis Carlos Ugalde, a former president of INE, acknowledged that Mexico’s strict limits on private donations are easily evaded by contributors seeking influence.  “The campaign (spending) limits are not respected” Ugalde said. “Private donors prefer to give without reporting it to buy access.”  In Mexico’s 2012 federal elections, less than three percent of campaign financing came from private donors, according to a document on INE’s website.  In the current election cycle, presidential candidates affiliated with parties are allowed to spend up to 429.6 million pesos ($21.8 million) during the campaign.  The government tightened campaign finance laws in 2007 following a contentious presidential race. A 2014 reform aimed to improve transparency and toughen penalties, including giving an electoral tribunal authority to annul the results of an election if the winner was found to have spent beyond the limits.   Still, doubts abound over the agency’s capacity to monitor illegal money. For every one peso declared in campaign spending, at least 15 pesos more go unreported, nonprofit Mexicanos Contra la Corruption estimated earlier this year.  In a poll released this week, more than a third of Mexicans surveyed said political parties had tried to buy their votes for a 2018 election, whether federal or local, according to the nonprofit Citizen’s Action Front Against Poverty.  A businessman linked to a massive corruption scandal involving Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA testified in 2016 to Brazilian prosecutors that the construction giant had channeled millions of dollars to a senior campaign official of Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico’s current president and a member of the PRI. Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied the allegations. Under Mexican law he is limited to a single, six-year term.   Mexico’s Attorney General said in 2017 that it would investigate the allegations. The probe is ongoing.  INE recently sanctioned an independent presidential candidate, Jaime Rodriguez, for financing irregularities. Rodriguez, who was fined 739,000 pesos ($37,423), denied wrongdoing and said the fine was unjust. He has raised 8.1 million pesos ($410,984) for his campaign, all through private contributions.  Marco Fernandez, a professor at the government school at the Tec de Monterrey university, said INE’s action showed it was becoming more sophisticated at rooting out campaign finance violations. But he said the generally small fines and lack of consequences for candidates with parties or their donors were not much of a deterrent.  “Unfortunately, so far, electoral lies are still very cheap,” Fernandez said.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph 17 to clarify that an electoral tribunal, not INE, has the power to annul elections.)

The four independent commissioners behind the investigation also urged major powers to rescue at least 3,200 women and children still held by Islamic State (ISIS) and to refer the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution. ""ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,"" said another investigator, Carla del Ponte. ""Of course, we regard that as a road map for prosecution, for future prosecution."" The Yazidis are a religious sect whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. Islamic State, which aims to set up a theocratic caliphate in Syria and Iraq based on a radical interpretation of Sunni Islam, systematically killed, captured or enslaved thousands of Yazidis when it overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq in August 2014. Several mass graves have since been uncovered. The militant group tried to erase the Yazidis' identity by forcing men to choose between conversion to Islam and death, raping girls as young as nine, selling women at slave markets, and drafting boys to fight, the report said. ""No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,"" the report said. ""The scale of atrocities committed, their general nature, and the fact of deliberately and systematically targeting victims on account of their membership in a particular group, while excluding members of other groups, were other factors from which the Commission was able to infer genocidal intent.""

210,210,21-07-16 12:00,2016,7,21,Andrew Binns,The social soapbox: Democrats will embrace visual platforms at the 2016 Convention,"In 2008, a relatively unknown young U.S. senator running for president fundamentally changed political campaigns in this country. Barack Obama’s election in 2008, as the first social media president, marked the moment at which political campaigning began the significant shift from the television to the digital age. Social media platforms have since become the modern-day soapbox, providing new channels through which candidates and parties engage with voters. For evidence of the digital revolution, just follow the money. In the 2012 election cycle, political campaigns spent $159 million on digital media. In 2016, that figure is expected to top $1 billion. However, campaigns still largely use social media like they use television — by talking to the voters rather than with them. The 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia will change that in a way that should make every party, candidate and campaign manager sit up and take notice. Barack Obama’s election in 2008, as the first social media president, marked the moment at which political campaigning began the significant shift from the television to the digital age. This year, the Democratic National Convention will bring supporters into the conversation and tell the story of this historic event through the eyes of the attendees. Understanding that communication in this digital age is becoming increasingly visual, the convention will take the images captured by attendees and connect those images to other relevant information that supporters may be on the lookout for. Layering in this information and making all of these images ""intelligent"" will transform each image into an opportunity to engage supporters beyond the convention hall and lead them to information and action like never before. What’s more, the convention will track the performance of each image, and use that data to guide decisions about messaging. To do this, the convention will partner with Curalate, a marketing technology company that works with leading brands, as the convention understands the power this technology can provide to its platform and audience. The most innovative consumer brands in the world understand that discovery of their products increasingly happens visually through images and videos. The same is becoming true of how voters consume information about political parties and campaigns as visual platforms begin to dominate social media. While it’s highly likely that the dominant digital platform in the 2020 presidential election is still in the wireframing stage, you can bet that it will be based on visual content. Instagram didn’t even exist when President Obama took office — now it has half a billion users, up more than 600 percent since 2012. Snapchat currently boasts 150 million daily users and 10 billion videos viewed every day. And while it’s highly likely that the dominant digital platform in the 2020 presidential election is still in the wireframing stage, you can bet that it’ll be based on visual content. In 2016, voters will discover information about candidates and parties online through imagery to a greater extent than ever before. By using the latest technology and data available to consumer brands, the Democratic National Convention will be the most digitally engaged political event in history, and will demonstrate its commitment to innovation and to creating more compelling experiences for supporters. By taking full advantage of technology partners like Curalate, the convention will reach more people with more compelling, relevant content, and will transform a fleeting moment of discovery — when a person sees an image — into an opportunity, offering them more information and engaging them, welcoming them to join the whole country in the biggest conversation of the year. Andrew Binns is the chief innovation officer of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, which will be held July 25-28 in Philadelphia. Reach him @binns.

211,211,02-12-17 15:00,2017,12,2,Alex Ward,Michael Flynn’s plea deal leaves Trump with two bleak options,"Michael Flynn’s plea deal with prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe is a watershed moment for President Donald Trump — one that leaves him with two choices, each with clear risks. Flynn, who was Trump’s national security adviser for 24 days and was also a top campaign adviser, has admitted to lying to the FBI about two of his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016. But here’s the kicker: Flynn told investigators that “a very senior member” of Trump’s presidential transition team told him to make contact with Russian government officials — in other words, he’s now claiming he was just following orders when he went to talk to the Russians. Which means that Flynn’s plea deal and cooperation with the Mueller investigation could potentially implicate senior members of Trump’s inner circle, or even the president himself, in at the very least some questionable behavior. Indeed, reports have suggested that Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner may have been one of the senior officials of the transition team who directed Flynn to speak to the Russians. So at this point, Trump has two options for how to respond to all of this: try to make it all go away, or just try to minimize the potential damage. In other words: betray Flynn or fire Mueller. Betraying Flynn seems like the better option, even though it will lead to weeks of reports about the hypocrisy and outright lies of the Trump administration. But that seems far more preferable — and less risky — to firing Mueller, which could spark a massive political and constitutional crisis. Trump could try to downplay the significance of Flynn’s plea deal, saying that it still doesn’t implicate him or other members of his campaign. He could also try to downplay Flynn’s role in his campaign, making it seem like Flynn wasn’t an important figure during the election and that any interactions he had with Russians wouldn’t have come from the top. Early indications suggest that this may be the strategy the president’s lawyers are pursuing. Top White House lawyer Ty Cobb said in a statement shortly after the announcement of the plea deal that “[n]othing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.” That may be true for now. But the fact that Flynn is cooperating with the investigation means he could potentially give Mueller’s team information that does implicate other people in the Trump orbit. And trying to downplay Flynn’s involvement in the campaign would be a hard sell. Flynn, a former three-star general and Obama administration intelligence official, joined the campaign in February 2016 and immediately became a prominent campaign surrogate, offering Trump some credibility on foreign policy and national security affairs — two areas where Trump had no prior experience. He led chants of “Lock her up!” during the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016, referring to Hillary Clinton and the probe into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. And on November 17, 2016, just nine days after the election, Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser. That made Flynn one of the most powerful people in Washington, with responsibilities for overseeing and coordinating America’s wars, intelligence gathering, and diplomacy. (Flynn resigned in February after lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his conversations with Kislyak in December — the same conversations Flynn now admits to having lied to the FBI about in January.) Even once Flynn was gone, Trump still went to bat for him — going as far as asking then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn entirely. An assertion that Flynn wasn’t an important figure in the Trump inner circle would beggar belief. To be fair, Trump has no problem lying in general — especially to the press — and he’s no stranger to negative press coverage and shouts of hypocrisy. So throwing Flynn under the bus may actually be the safer option for him. But there’s a bleaker choice for Trump — firing Mueller — which could lead to a lot more trouble. The second option would be to fire Mueller in an attempt to end the probe altogether and prevent Mueller from using Flynn’s cooperation to build a case against the president, his family, or other top aides. Trump has mused about firing Mueller before, but held off, in part because senior lawmakers from both parties have warned him of serious and immediate consequences if he chose to do so. To many establishment Republicans, the prospect that Trump would fire Mueller is unimaginable. “I cannot possibly imagine the president terminating Bob Mueller,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said in June. “It just cannot happen.” But now that Flynn is cooperating with the special counsel, Trump might decide it’s worth the risk to let Mueller go — which could lead to outcries on Capitol Hill, even from Republicans. There’s another potential problem for Trump, though: Getting rid of Mueller might not actually be as easy as it sounds. That’s because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress back in June that he interpreted the special counsel regulation to mean that he (Rosenstein) is the only person in government with the authority to fire Mueller — not the president. And he said that he would only fire Mueller for “good cause,” and would refuse to carry out an order from the president to fire Mueller if good cause were not established. It’s doubtful that Rosenstein would consider Trump not wanting himself, his family, or his close aides to potentially be indicted on criminal charges to be “good cause,” and would thus refuse to fire Mueller. Which means Trump would have to fire Rosenstein — and perhaps several more Justice Department officials — until he found one willing to carry out his order. That could get very, very messy — and potentially provoke a constitutional crisis. Here’s why: Throughout the entire process, Trump would purposely be trying to kill an investigation that could charge him, his family members, or his close associates with crimes. That would mean he was putting his personal interests above the law — and no president is above the law. It would be a blatant attempt at a cover-up. Senators on both sides of the aisle, including Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE), have proposed a bill to protect Mueller and avoid such a scenario. Explaining his proposed bill, Tillis told CNN in August, ""The President would maintain the power to remove the special counsel, but we would just want to make sure that it had merit and have that back-end judicial process.” “And if there is a termination, we just want to make sure, through judicial review, that it was warranted,” he added. Congress has yet to pass that bill, though, which means that Trump could still fire Mueller and potentially provoke a showdown with the Justice Department. That’s why Coons seems adamant that he will continue to push his bill. “It’s now more important than ever that Special Counsel Mueller is able to continue his investigation without interference, and I am continuing to work on bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel from being fired without cause,” Coons said in a statement on Friday.",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/2/16724016/flynn-trump-fbi-mueller-russia-deal,,Vox
212,212,04-04-17 16:53,2017,4,4,Kyle Cantlon,NHLPA Blasts League Over Decision to Skip 2018 Olympics,"This article originally appeared on VICE Sports Canada. The NHL's polarizing decision to skip out on the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea on Monday has been met with disappointment and anger by many players across the league, including some of its biggest stars. In a statement released by the league's owners, with commissioner Gary Bettman calling the matter ""officially closed"" on Tuesday, the NHL essentially directed most of the blame toward the IOC and NHLPA for not offering concessions that would make it worthwhile for the league to shut down for 17 days in the middle of its season next February. In response, the Players Association released a statement of its own on Monday night, leading off with a line that read, ""The players are extraordinarily disappointed and adamantly disagree with the NHL's shortsighted decision to not continue our participation in the Olympics."" Here's the rest of the statement: Any sort of inconvenience the Olympics may cause to next season's schedule is a small price to pay compared to the opportunity to showcase our game and our greatest players on this enormous international stage.  A unique opportunity lies ahead with the 2018 and 2022 Olympics in Asia. The NHL may believe it is penalizing the IOC or the players, or both, for not giving the owners some meaningful concessions in order to induce them to agree to go to PyeongChang. Instead this impedes the growth of our great game by walking away from an opportunity to reach sports fans worldwide. Moreover, it is doing so after the financial issues relating to insurance and transportation have been resolved with the IOC and IIHF. The League's efforts to blame others for its decision is as unfortunate as the decision itself. NHL players are patriotic and they do not take this lightly. A decent respect for the opinions of the players matters. This is the NHL's decision, and its alone. It is very unfortunate for the game, the players and millions of loyal hockey fans. Aside from the collective message from the NHLPA to the league, many coaches and players around the NHL commented individually on their disappointment in the NHL's decision to skip the premier international sporting event in the world during a time when the game is desperate to grow across the pond. Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Mike Babcock, who was Canada's bench boss for its last two consecutive Olympic gold medals in 2010 and 2014, said, ''I'm just going to tell you I'm disappointed.'' Future Hall of Fame goaltenders Carey Price, who backstopped Canada to a gold medal in 2014, and Henrik Lundqvist, who led Sweden to a gold in 2006, each chimed in to voice their disappointment with the league's choice to forgo the 2018 Games. ''It's beyond disappointing. It was one of the best experiences of my life and catapulted my career to the next level and things have been going pretty well since then,'' said Price. ""I feel like we're short changing some of the younger players that haven't had that opportunity."" Lundqvist, meanwhile, took to Twitter to voice his displeasure about the decision. Disappointing news, — Henrik Lundqvist (@HLundqvist30)April 3, 2017 Lundqvist's Swedish teammate, Henrik Zetterberg, commented on the matter in a postgame scrum after Monday's contest against Ottawa. ""I haven't really seen the statement yet, but I'm not real surprised. They probably want something from us, as always,"" said Zetterberg. — Marc-Édouard Vlasic (@Vlasic44)April 3, 2017 Star Senators defenceman Erik Karlsson came swinging, too. .— Craig Custance (@CraigCustance)April 4, 2017 Team Canada and San Jose Sharks defenceman Marc-Edouard Vlasic simply tweeted out a cryptic photo (see above) of the OIympic rings right after the NHL's announcement, while eight-year NHL veteran Brandon Prust, who is now playing in the DEL in Germany, took a more direct approach and went right at the commissioner with his always-honest opinion. Way to ruin the sport of hockey even more Gary — Brandon Prust (@BrandonPrust8)April 3, 2017 The 2022 Games in China are likely still in play for the NHL.

213,213,23-02-16 19:10,2016,2,23,John Patty,The game theory behind Mitch McConnell's Supreme Court strategy,"This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. In the immediate wake of Justice Scalia's death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell very quickly announced that President Obama should not name Scalia's successor. A great deal of attention has been paid (including by the Onion) to the political posturing that has taken place in the hours and days since. Understandably, much of it focuses on what kind of nominee might actually be nominated and whether such a nominee would actually be confirmed. We're going to take a different tack and consider why McConnell so quickly tried to preempt a nominee in the first place. Formally, it is very easy for McConnell and his Republican colleagues to ensure that no Obama nominee would be confirmed (though the Democrats could make life difficult). Given this, then standard ""gatekeeping'' logic (see here) implies that the GOP can only gain from at least seeing whom Obama would nominate: If Obama nominates an unacceptable nominee, the GOP senators can simply say no to whomever Obama nominates. Furthermore, withstanding the pressure to vote on an Obama nominee could help GOP incumbents signal their commitment to the conservative principles, such as gun rights, that Scalia stood for on the Court. This logic is laid out by one of us in ""Signaling Through Obstruction"" (ungated version). However, from a strategic standpoint, McConnell might fear that 14 or more of his colleagues would not be willing to obstruct a moderate and well-qualified nominee. In fact, some senators might actually be willing to vote for a relatively liberal nominee because they fear being perceived as too conservative by moderate voters. This logic lies at the heart of the reaction described by Tim Groseclose and Nolan McCarty. The possibility of incumbents fearing the blame game is unusually important for McConnell this year because the GOP has 24 Senate incumbents up for reelection this year, and of the 12 competitive Senate races this year, 10 are for seats currently held by Republicans. Naturally, most of those competitive seats are in states where the electorate is relatively more moderate — places like Illinois (Mark Kirk), Missouri (Roy Blunt), North Carolina (Richard Burr), New Hampshire (Kelly Ayotte), and Ohio (Rob Portman). Such incumbents might worry that obstruction would be too costly in terms of alienating independent voters in the general election. Indeed, see Kirk's op-ed from Monday, in which he wrote: I recognize the right of the president, be it Republican or Democrat, to place before the Senate a nominee for the Supreme Court and I fully expect and look forward to President Barack Obama advancing a nominee for the Senate to consider. Putting the ""Signaling Through Obstruction"" and ""Blame Game"" logics together creates a rich set of scenarios for McConnell, who is undoubtedly uncertain not only about how the electoral environments facing his 24 colleagues will unfold, but also about how these colleagues will behave as the election progresses. Accordingly, he may have a strong incentive to avoid forcing his colleagues to go ""on the record"" with either a vote on a Supreme Court nominee, or with being seen as complicit in obstructing one, particularly one who will likely be widely perceived as extremely qualified and politically moderate. After all, if there is no nominee to vote for or obstruct, voters cannot infer much, if anything, about their incumbents' stances from their actions. As has been well documented by political science research (see here and here for examples), senators are sensitive to opinion among their political base when voting on Supreme Court nominees. At the same time, well-qualified, moderate nominees tend to be broadly politically popular. In other words, the problem for McConnell is that if President Obama selects a well-qualified, politically moderate nominee, Republicans will have to decide whether to go on the record voting against the nominee, revealing themselves to be ideological extremists, or to support a political moderate, nominated by President Obama, potentially upsetting their political bases. In the context of a competitive election, the choice is then between the base and independents, both of which are necessary to win reelection in closely divided states. In line with all of this, and as one of us has pointed out in another post, there may be a strong interest among Democrats in keeping the nomination debate going as part of the election, whereas Republicans might have a distinct interest in ending the discussion (or at least hiding it from public discussion until after the election). Many have speculated that McConnell's reluctance is due to his hope that a future Republican president might nominate Justice Scalia's replacement. However, our logic suggests a different rationale. Given President Obama's relatively constrained political capital and the GOP's control of the Senate, this seems like a good opportunity for the Republicans to press Obama for a moderate nominee. However, that might be exactly what McConnell fears! McConnell's desire to preempt any Obama nominee is motivated by the fear that, when confronted by a nominee, his GOP colleagues will confront a Catch-22 in which, regardless of what they say or do, the GOP's prospects for maintaining control of the Senate in 2017 will be worsened. Scalia's passing rocked the political scene, and left Mitch McConnell in a very hard place indeed.",https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/2/23/11099096/mcconnell-preemptively-obstruct,,Vox
214,214,06-06-19 00:00,2019,6,6,"Corina Pons, Mayela Armas",Venezuela loses $1.4 billion of gold to banks for guarantees: sources,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Citibank and Deutsche Bank have taken control of around $1.4 billion of Venezuelan government gold, which they received as guarantees for loans, as a result of U.S. sanctions on the Venezuelan Central Bank, according to five sources.  Between 2014 and 2016 the central bank (BCV) used a portion of its foreign gold reserves to guarantee financial operations with banks to boost liquidity, with the intention of repaying the loans to avoid losing the gold.  Five sources with knowledge of the deals said the BCV had agreed with Citibank and Deutsche Bank to buy back the gold in 2020 and 2021, but since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the BCV in April the banks had invoked a condition of the contracts to retain ownership of the bars.  Both banks had resolved that an “event of default” had occurred due to the sanctions, as established in agreements underpinning the gold swap deals, the sources said.  Citibank took control of gold for around $400 million BCV was supposed to repay in 2020. For a separate guarantee Deutsch Bank took $1 billion, the sources said.  Citibank and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and the BCV did not respond to a request to comment.  Reuters has not been able to review the gold swap contracts the BCV signed with the banks and it is not clear if the central bank could initiate legal proceedings to seek to regain control of the gold.  Since 2017, the BCV has partially recovered some gold bars it used to guarantee the loans, at the same time as it began to sell dozens of tonnes of gold to Turkey and other Middle Eastern allies to earn vital foreign currency, according to the sources and official data.  The BCV in 2018 had paid $172 million to Citibank to recover part of the gold it had put up as guarantee in a swap operation.  In March of this year, the BCV was unable to pay $1.1 billion to Citibank via a repurchase agreement to recover part of the gold it gave to Citibank for a $1.6 billion loan, sources told Reuters at the time. The BCV was supposed to pay another $400 million in 2020 to Citibank under the agreement, but Citibank has now taken the gold instead.   Both banks can now sell the Venezuelan gold to recover the value of the loans, and any money left over would be returned to Venezuela, the sources said. But under U.S. sanctions banks are restricted from carrying out any transactions with the BCV.  Opposition leader Juan Guaido’s team has approached Citibank and Deutsche Bank to ask the banks to deposit a portion of the gold in accounts that President Nicolas Maduro’s government can not access, three sources said.  Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely considered fraudulent.  Most Western nations recognize Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader, while Maduro calls Guaido a coup-mongering U.S. puppet.

215,215,06-08-18 00:00,2018,8,6,Tim Hume,A crackdown is underway after Venezuela’s president was attacked with exploding drones," Six people were arrested Sunday over an apparent assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro using explosive-laden drones.   Analysts warn the arrests are likely to be just the start of a brutal crackdown in response to the embarrassing security breach.  The socialist leader, who is presiding over an escalating economic and humanitarian crisis, was giving a speech at a military event in the capital Caracas Saturday evening when two DJI M600 drones, each carrying a kilogram of C-4 explosive, flew near his podium. The military knocked one drone off-course electronically, and the other crashed into a nearby apartment building, Interior Minister Nestor Luis Reverol said Sunday, describing it as a terrorist attack.  Pandemonium broke out as the devices exploded, with bodyguards scrambling to cover Maduro with shields. Hundreds of soldiers gathered for the event ran for cover.  Maduro’s government has blamed the attack on an international plot involving local militants, supported by Colombia’s outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos, and dissident networks based in Miami. Reverol said one of the six arrested had an outstanding warrant for an alleged role in an August 2017 attack on a military base in Valencia. Another had been previously arrested during anti-government protests in 2014.

Reverol said one of the six arrested had an outstanding warrant for an alleged role in an August 2017 attack on a military base in Valencia. Another had been previously arrested during anti-government protests in 2014.  An obscure group called the “Soldiers in T-shirts” claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, saying the military had shot down its drones.  “We demonstrated that they are vulnerable. We didn’t have success today, but it’s just a question of time,” the group said.  Colombia has denied any involvement in the plot, while U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said Sunday that if Venezuela had any hard information on a U.S. link to the attempted assassination, it should hand it over.  Diego Moya-Ocampos, senior analyst for the Americas at IHS Country Risk, said it was difficult to independently verify who was behind the attack. But the embarrassing optics of the incident, which had highlighted the vulnerability of the government’s security apparatus, meant a hardline response from Maduro’s government was very likely.  “We saw soldiers breaking rank, fleeing the scene, terrorized,” he told VICE News. “The government is highly likely to respond with a purge within the security apparatus, and probably stage a crackdown against opposition and union groups which have been staging protests in the past month.”  He said little was known about the “Soldiers in T-shirts,” a group which had first announced its existence on social media during anti-government protests in 2014, and had later expressed support for Oscar Perez, a rogue police officer who commandeered a helicopter to launch an attack on government buildings last year. Perez and several of his associates were later killed in a gun battle after more than six months on the run.  If the assassination attempt was indeed the work of a radical Venezuelan militant group, Moya-Ocampos said, the attack would show an increased capability of such cells, and make further attacks more likely, raising the risk of a low-level insurgency.  Maduro, a former bus driver who sees himself as continuing the socialist revolution of his mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, has faced growing opposition as the country struggles with crippling hyperinflation, and dire food and medicine shortages. He won re-election for another six-year term in May in a deeply-flawed vote which the opposition, whose top candidates were barred from running, decried as a farce.  READ:  Venezuelans continue their exodus after Maduro’s re-election  “The government is increasingly shutting down any means of a peaceful democratic solution,” said Moya-Ocampos. “Because it’s impossible to push for a political or negotiated solution, opposition groups are turning to political violence as the only way to force regime change.” Cover image: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro delivers a speech during a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018 day in which Venezuela's controversial Constituent Assembly marks its first anniversary.(JUAN BARRETO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/ne548k/maduro-attacked-drones-assassination-venezuela,,Vice News

Their polling, as of now, shows Clinton winning the state's massive delegate haul, and a debate would simply be an opportunity to screw that up. The problem is that their reasoning, though tactically correct, would strike people as rather less than sporting. So the Clinton campaign has come up with the argument that Sanders has somehow crossed a line with his negative campaigning. ""They’re talking about running harsher negatives now,"" Joel Benenson, Clinton's pollster, complained to CNN. This is flatly absurd. The Democratic primary — including the debates — has been substantive and respectful. Sanders has, at times, bent over backward to run a positive race, as when he refused to hound Clinton over her emails. If any candidate has ever proven himself a fair and courteous adversary, it's Sanders. The mockery Sanders's supporters are throwing at Clinton is entirely merited. This is the Clinton campaign at its worst. The argument isn't just false, it also insults the intelligence of voters. The message is that debates are something Clinton graciously concedes to rather than participates in as part of the democratic process. And the whole effort baits and annoys the Sanders supporters whom Clinton ultimately needs to win over. Politics ain't beanbag. If the Clinton campaign doesn't want another debate, no one can force them into it. But if they didn't want another debate, they should have just said so, and offered some anodyne excuse like they wanted to spend more time campaigning in New York and less time campaigning on television.

221,221,06-05-19 00:00,2019,5,6,Frank Pingue,Horse racing: Appeal over Kentucky Derby disqualification denied,"(Reuters) - An appeal filed by the owner of Maximum Security, the horse that finished first in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday but was later disqualified for interference, was denied by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission on Monday.  The appeal was filed by an attorney for Gary West, whose horse became the first winner to be disqualified for an on-track infraction.   The racing commission called the request “moot” because the decision to disqualify Maximum Security and install second-placed Country House as winner was not subject to appeal.  “The stewards unanimously disqualified Maximum Security following two objections lodged immediately after the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby and after a thorough review of the race replay,” the commission wrote in a letter.   “That determination is not subject to an appeal.”  After a 20-minute video review, officials found that Maximum Security, who was 4-1 favorite to win the 1-1/4 mile race, was guilty of a contact foul when he appeared to take a wide turn and impede other horses in the home stretch.  The disqualification ruling handed the win to Country House, which had been a 65-1 long shot.  West told NBC’s “Today” earlier on Monday that the dramatic turn on events at Churchill Downs left him “stunned, shocked and in total disbelief” and that his bay colt would not be in the field for the May 18 Preakness Stakes, the second leg of U.S. thoroughbred horse racing’s Triple Crown.  “It was literally like the old TV show, ‘The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat’, all within a 22-minute period of time,” said West, who owns Maximum Security with his wife.  “Winning it was the most euphoric thing I have probably ever had in our lives and disappointment when they took the horse down for the first time in history, we were stunned, shocked and in total disbelief. It had never been done before.”  The decision even caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said on Twitter the disqualification of Maximum Security could only happen in “these days of political correctness”.  West said he did see Maximum Security, who led from nearly start to finish, move over several lanes but felt such contact was inevitable given the number of horses allowed to race in the Kentucky Derby, which usually features 20 horses but this year had 19 year after a late scratch.  “Churchill Downs, because they’re a greedy organization, has (20 horses) rather than 14 like you have in the Kentucky Oaks, the Breeders’ Cup, every other race in America,” said West.  “Just because they can make more money, they’re willing to risk horses’ lives and peoples’ lives to do that. I’m not a fan of that. I think they ought to have 14 like every other race.,” said West.  “Yes I saw the horse move out, but every Kentucky Derby, you could sit down two or three or four horses if you wanted to, because it’s like a rodeo out there.”  When asked for comment, Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery said in an email to Reuters that the infraction by Maximum Security had nothing to do with the number of horses in the race and that there is no evidence to the contrary.  West said there would be no rematch with Country House when Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course hosts the Preakness Stakes.  “We are not going to run The Preakness,” said West. “There’s no Triple Crown on the line for us, and no reason to run a horse back in two weeks when you don’t have to.”  Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Gabriella Borter; Editing by Bill Trott, Ed Osmond and Pritha Sarkar",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-horseracing-kentucky/horse-racing-appeal-over-kentucky-derby-disqualification-denied-idUSKCN1SC18E,Sports News,Reuters

Roche said on Monday that both companies received a request for more information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in connection with the FTC’s review of the deal, sending Spark shares down nearly 15% at $93 in premarket trading on Monday.    Roche also said that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened an investigation.  Roche wants to buy Spark to, among other things, get a hold of U.S. firm’s experimental gene therapy for hemophilia A as well as its platform to develop other treatments for genetic diseases. But Roche has been forced to push back completion repeatedly, this time giving itself to July 31, beyond its self-imposed first-half deadline, to wrap things up.  “The parties remain committed to the transaction and are working cooperatively and expeditiously with the FTC in connection with its review,” Roche said in a statement.  The FTC has said it does not comment on cases it is reviewing.  The British regulator’s separate inquiry is aimed at determining whether the CMA considers it has jurisdiction over Roche’s acquisition, and if so, whether it could hurt competition in Britain.   “Pending the outcome of its investigation, the CMA has issued an Interim Enforcement Order that would become effective upon closing of the transaction and would require Roche to hold separate the Spark business,” Roche said. “The parties are working cooperatively with the CMA and will continue to do so.”  Reporting by John Miller; Additional reporting by Tamara Mathias; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Anil D'Silva",https://www.reuters.com/article/sparktherapeutics-ma-roche/update-1-roches-43-bln-spark-bid-delayed-again-amid-us-uk-scrutiny-idUSL8N23H2O3,Business News,Reuters
223,223,20-03-19 00:00,2019,3,20,David Gilbert,"The Christchurch gunman was stopped from attacking a third target, police say","New Zealand police revealed Wednesday that the gunman who shot and killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last Friday planned to attack a third target. “We strongly believe we stopped him on the way to a further attack, so lives were saved,” Commissioner Mike Bush told reporters at a press conference in Christchurch. The suspect, who has been charged with murder, attacked the Masjid Al Noor mosque near the center of the city, killing dozens of people, then got in his car and drove a few miles to the Linwood Islamic Centre. He was arrested soon after, but authorities say he would have continued his attack had he not been stopped. Bush declined to give further details about the location of the third target, or whether it was another mosque, so as not to “traumatize others.” The revelation came as the first victims of the atrocity were buried Wednesday.

Khalid Mustafa, 44, and his 15-year-old son, Hamza Mustafa, who had arrived in New Zealand from Syria last year, were the first to be buried. A boy of 3, born in New Zealand to Somali refugee parents, was also buried. READ: No one reported the Christchurch massacre while it was being live streamed However, families of some of the victims have voiced frustration at the delay in releasing the bodies. Postmortems have been completed on all 50 victims, but just 30 bodies have been released so far. There are still 29 people in the hospital as a result of injuries suffered in the attacks, with eight of them in critical condition. Prime Minister Jacinta Ardern said Wednesday she understood the frustration of the families given that Islamic funerals typically take place as soon as possible after death, but she added that she had “seen those who are working on this process as well and I can also acknowledge that they are working incredibly hard too.” Ardern announced that the country would hold a two-minute time of silence Friday to honor those who died in the attacks, and that the Islamic call to prayer would be broadcast on public TV and radio stations as a show of support for the Muslim community. The Al Noor mosque announced it would hold Friday prayers this week, one week after the gunman killed 42 people there. “We are going to prayer here on Friday,” Imam Gamal Fouda, the mosque’s religious leader, told the New Zealand Herald. “The majority of people, including myself, we decided to come and prayer close to our site. We will never forsake it to please those people who actually attacked us.” As New Zealand continues to mourn the worst terrorist attack in its history, terrorist organizations are seeking to use the attack to their advantage.  Islamic State spokesperson Abu Hassan Al Muhajir issued a 44-minute speech Tuesday calling on supporters to seek revenge. “The scenes of the massacres in the two mosques should wake up those who were fooled, and should incite the supporters of the caliphate to avenge their religion,” he said. This was the first statement in six months from Al Muhajir, a recluse so secretive that no one knows what he looks like, highlighting the significance of the speech.

226,226,26-05-16 00:00,2016,5,26,,Mississippi governor to join suit against Obama transgender policy,"(Reuters) - Mississippi’s Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join a lawsuit by officials from 11 states to overturn an Obama administration directive that tells schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity.  The lawsuit led by Texas, the most significant legal challenge to this month’s directive, said the federal government and Obama administration officials overreached their authority by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states.  “Our office has talked to the Texas attorney general’s office and I intend, as soon as possible, to join the lawsuit against this latest example of federal overreach,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement.  As with some of the other states, Mississippi’s governor and attorney general disagree on the suit, which challenges the administration’s interpretation that federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination should apply to transgender people.  Mississippi’s attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, declined to participate in the lawsuit, according to Clay Chandler, a spokesman for the governor. Chandler said Bryant will work with an attorney in the governor’s office in joining the lawsuit.  Hood’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama’s administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority.  Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona’s Department of Education and Maine’s governor.  The lawsuit said the administration “conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.”  Transgender rights advocates criticized the suit as a malicious attack, saying there have never been public safety incidents or invasions of privacy related to protections for transgender people.  “While the department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans,” the Justice Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

227,227,18-10-18 00:00,2018,10,18,Alexis Clements,Liliana Porter Shows How Everything Familiar Must Be Magnified or Forgotten,"An exhibition at El Museo del Barrio brings us to the thorny side of profound themes like martyrdom and labor. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads After nearly a year of renovations, El Museo del Barrio has opened with a show that couldn’t be better suited to this moment: Liliana Porter: Other Situations. A traveling exhibition from the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia, curated by their own Humberto Moro, the show features only 32 works, but they span Porter’s decades-long career and highlight the wry wit and incisive perspective of this artist who deserves more prominence in the US. From drawing, to prints and photographs, to sculptures, installations, and films, Porter’s work, no matter its form, demands a kind of noticing, a paying attention that, in many ways, can only be done in the context of a museum or a gallery. Like the white void that she places her objects and ideas within, the act of isolation is crucial to the humor and the dark questions that permeate her work. Liliana Porter, “Martyr [Martir]” (2005), archival digital print, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Liliana Porter, “Mouse Pad Artwork [Arte de Mouse Pad]” (2004), archival digital print, El Museo del Barrio, 2018 In a bustling grocery store, stacked high with wares, packed with customers, and filled with the white noise of commerce, you might otherwise never notice a diminutive slice of soft cheese named after a nineteen year old woman who was burned at the stake. Plucked by the ever-vigilant Porter and placed on an open plain in a photograph, one is forced to confront the object on its own terms. What is the flavor of martyrdom? Of betrayal? Of a woman being burned at the stake? Does it pair best with a dark cracker or a crusty loaf? But it’s not just the cheese. Here, this work is laid out with two others in a triptych. Beside Joan of Arc sits Che Guevara, in this instance rendered by the manufacturer as a “Martyr Mousepad.” On the other side of Joan is a sugar Jesus wrapped in cellophane, paired with another Jesus flipped over to reveal the price and ingredients in this most unholy body of Christ. Seeing the works and their depicted objects together, a more complex set of meanings unfold, a strange alliance. And also a much thornier inquiry into martyrdom itself. As anti-Muslim sentiment continues to simmer and regularly boil over in the US, it’s virtually impossible in this context not to think of the particular way that news stories describe Muslim individuals being killed or committing suicidal acts of violence in the name of their religious and/or political views, whether in Syria, Palestine, Iraq, or here in the US. The West bends over backwards to paint those acts by Muslims as deeply other, foreign, and backward; as untenable in white, Judeo-Christian nations. Reminders of those moments certainly aren’t on offer in the box stores and supermarkets that line our streets, rendered in sugar, or cream, or foam. Rather than a cruel sneer or an act of distancing, the darker political and philosophical questions contained in some of Porter’s work draw the viewer in, inviting you to sift through your own trinkets and fallibility. An invitation offered by a child’s toy, or a cheap miniature that feels both familiar and enticing is quite a different thing than a pundit decrying the other side, whichever side it is. Would I have bought that slice of cheese and laughed about it over wine? I might have. How many people walk the streets in t-shirts or paper their walls with images of Che Guevara — a silhouette rendered so meaningless through mass consumerism that many who don his face have no idea who he is or what exactly he did after his youthful motorcycle journey. An Argentine who has lived in the US since 1964, Porter maintains her relationship with Argentina, and also maintains a steady popularity in Latin America. There, her work has been exhibited regularly since her first show at the age of seventeen, during a time when she was living in Mexico with her family. The rise and fall of so many socialist and revolutionary governments in Central and South America since her birth in 1941, including in Argentina, and the bloody involvement of the US in countless coups, assassinations, and armed conflicts there, is something that is almost entirely absent in US history courses, nor is it present in the consciousness of many in this country. Yet, hypocrisy and complicity are something that someone with feet in both the north and the south can’t help but take in. Perhaps the funniest work in this show to touch on the ideas above, is a large-scale photograph titled simply “Memorabilia” (2016). Again, against a blank, edgeless backdrop, Porter has arranged a group of figurines, ceramic objects, and other cheaply manufactured items, each featuring the image of political figures ranging from China’s Mao Zedong to France’s Napoleon Bonaparte to the US’s George Washington and John F. Kennedy to Argentina’s Eva Perón. For some in the US, they might jar at seeing Washington or Kennedy next to Mao or Napoleon. But again, it’s a matter of framing, of the narrative you spin. And though largely silent, Porter’s work is very much about the stories you spin while looking at it. Installation view Liliana Porter, “Man Painting [Hombre pintando]” (2018), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Installation view Liliana Porter, “Trabajo Forzado (Mujer barriendo) [Forced Labor (Sweeping Woman)]” (2004-2018), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018Installation view Liliana Porter, “The Task (Black Piano) [La area (piano negro)” (2016), mixed media, El Museo del Barrio, 2018 Another theme that appears frequently in the works on display is that of labor, of tiny workers bent steadily into tasks, the enormity of which simultaneously dwarfs and enlarges each laborer. If you were to stitch together all the clothing sewn by a garment worker, or to lay out all the walls that a house painter has ever painted, as these works seem to invite us to do, you might be struck by the endlessness of those tasks. The janitor who returns each night to make clean what will only be made dirty tomorrow; the homemaker who cooks one meal, only to do it again in a few hours. I couldn’t help but think of Hannah Arendt’s brilliant writing in her book The Human Condition while looking at these works: “It is indeed the mark of all laboring that it leaves nothing behind, that the result of its effort is almost as quickly consumed as the effort is spent. And yet this effort, despite its futility, is born of a great urgency and motivated by a more powerful drive than anything else, because life itself depends upon it.” Feminist thinkers and labor observers have long noted the invisibility and complete lack or paltry nature of the payments that many laborers are given in our society. In the context of El Museo, it’s not a far leap to consider the ways in which Latin American labor, particularly Central American labor, has been exploited, manipulated, and discarded in this country. And this is just a taste of what this relatively concise but incredibly rich show can elicit. The two digital videos that are part of the exhibit, “Actualidades / Breaking News” (2016) and “Matinee” (2009), introduce new ideas, but also revisit figures and suggestions that appear elsewhere in Porter’s work. Moving imagery is a form that works incredibly well for her. A deft sense of selection and grouping, paired with timing and soundscapes, offers a novel approach that builds new meanings. There’s tremendous fodder for thoughtful consideration, ready laughter, and recognition in these works. By calling and holding our attention on things that can easily be taken for granted, Porter quietly and with a mischievous smile, nudges us to reconsider everything we see. Liliana Porter: Other Situations continues at El Museo del Barrio (1230 5th Ave, Manhattan) through January 27, 2019. This exhibition was curated by Humberto Moro.",https://hyperallergic.com/462913/liliana-porter-shows-how-everything-familiar-must-be-magnified-or-forgotten/,,Hyperallergic
228,228,13-02-17 15:49,2017,2,13,Chris Weller,School start times getting pushed back in response to sleep science,"With a population of just over 11,000, Dobbs Ferry, New York is your typical sleepy town, except for one thing: When the first school bell rings, kids actually feel awake. Prior to the 2015-2016 school year, Dobbs Ferry middle schoolers started at 8:15 a.m. and high schoolers at 7:30 a.m. Under the new policy, both schools now start approximately 30 minutes later and end 15 minutes later. In making those changes, the Dobbs Ferry School District joined a small but growing group of middle and high schools around the US that have started pushing back their start times in an effort to combat grogginess. The changes are bolstered by a mountain of sleep science research that says pre-teens and teenagers are some of society's most sleep-deprived people and would actually do better in school with more rest. These forward-thinking schools are finally listening — and letting kids sleep in. What happens when you start later? A new study involving 30,000 high-school students across 29 schools in seven states found that graduation rates and attendance rates both went up in the two years after schools pushed start times to at least 8:30 a.m. Dobbs Ferry Superintendent Dr. Lisa Brady tells Business Insider that the schools there have experienced tremendous benefits. Following a survey issued at the end of the 2015-2016 school year (the first full year with later start times), Brady says ""it was clear from both the parents and the kids, overwhelmingly, that the mornings were just less stressful."" Many of the kids reported having more time to eat breakfast and get ready for school, while parents said they didn't have to drag kids out of bed or yell at them to hurry up. Once students got to school, they felt more alert. At night, they tended to reported going to bed at the same time, even though the new schedule freed up an extra 45 minutes. Other schools have seen similar benefits. In Seattle, 85% of middle and high schools in the 2016-2017 school year swapped start times with the elementary schools. Now the older kids start at 8:45 while the youngsters start at 7:55. Kira Hoffman, an eighth-grader at Jane Addams Middle School, told KUOW that she ""no longer feels super-rushed or worried about how much I've slept, or when I'm going to get to school, or if I'm going to be late."" In Pennsylvania, a new hope So far, hundreds of schools in 44 states have jumped on the late-start bandwagon, according to advocacy group Start School Later, which has been compiling a list of US schools and districts that have pushed back the first bell. One of those is Solebury School in New Hope, Pennsylvania, where Director of Studies Rick Tony pushed for a robust set of changes to the school schedule. Kids at Solebury, a private boarding and day school, now start at 8:30 a.m most days, and 9:00 a.m. on Wednesdays. In years past, the first bell sounded promptly at 8. The school also moved from six 50-minute classes per day to four 80-minute classes. With fewer teachers to assign homework, Tony says, kids can still enjoy their nights even if they get home slightly later. ""Every time we ask for feedback, the results come back 10 to 1, positive to negative,"" he tells Business Insider. Tony also teaches math, and says his students are already producing better work on a more consistent basis, even though the schedule is just six months old. Around campus, he says, kids seem more relaxed since they're not juggling as much work early in the day. ""The freneticism is definitely reduced this year,"" he says, adding that he plans to follow up with teachers to get harder data about student achievement. The downsides of delaying start times Negative responses to later start times are rare, but they do happen. Lisa Brady says some parents in Dobbs Ferry have found it harder to complete the necessary morning rituals and still get to work on time. Meanwhile, Rick Tony says the issue at Solebury is finding enough buses for kids. In both cases, officials say parents have the option to drop their kids off at school before the first bell so they can eat breakfast, charge their devices, or just hang out. Brady has also found challenges with after-school athletics and clubs. In years prior, teams had no trouble getting to away games. Now they have less time to get there, and they have to deal with worse traffic. ""The kids feel really rushed,"" she says. Many kids also say they have less time to do homework once they finally get home. Brady says the Dobbs Ferry schools are brainstorming potential changes to the school day similar to those made at Solebury. It takes a village In districts where schools have not started to take sleep science research into account, parents have begun to speak up. An op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times in September 2016 included voices from frustrated parents who were fed up with coaxing bleary-eyed adolescents to get dressed. ""I have been saying for years that kids, especially high school students, should not be expected to be in their seats trying to learn anything in the early morning hours,"" a parent named Paula Del said. When asked why more schools have yet to take her district's lead, Brady speculated that it has something to do with generational pride. Even if the science is rock-solid, many administrators and parents simply don't pity the sleepy teen. Waking up is hard, but it's a part of life. ""I get that years ago we all walked 100 miles in the snow to school,"" Brady says. ""But we know better now about the adolescent brain, and we know about their natural sleep rhythms being different than adults'.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/schools-starting-later-more-sleep-2017-2,,Business Insider
229,229,28-02-18 17:20,2018,2,28,Alexia Fernández Campbell,Gun stocks divestment: Parkland shooting has made gun stocks toxic assets on Wall Street,"Pressure is mounting on Wall Street to do something about gun control. Investment firms are reexamining their portfolios, dropping gun stocks, and asking weapons manufacturers what they are doing to make sure their products don't end up in a mass shooting. This reevaluation comes as public anger over political inaction on gun control shifts toward the American companies that profit from gun sales. It started with social media calls for companies — like Hertz, MetLife, and Delta — to end their partnerships with the National Rifle Association. Many of the companies targeted did. Now Wall Street firms are coming under fire for investing retirement savings and pension funds in companies like American Outdoor Brands, which makes the AR-15 rifle used in the Parkland shooting. Last week, New Jersey lawmakers moved to restrict all state employee pension funds from investing in gun manufacturers. Joanne McCall, president of the Florida Education Association, is urging state lawmakers to do the same. Shareholders at American Outdoor Brands, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Sturm Ruger asked those companies to report on steps they’re taking to improve gun safety and mitigate gun violence. The requests were filed by religious groups linked to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which includes 300 institutional investors that manage $400 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg. (Dick’s Sporting Goods on Wednesday announced that it was ending sales of assault-style weapons at its stores.) Meanwhile, reports that major 401(k) index funds run by Vanguard and TIAA-CREF have ownership stakes in the big three gunmakers have also prompted a social-media backlash: Time to divest from the gun industry, @TIAA and @Vanguard_Group. #NeverAgain https://t.co/70qYEIk4NP Wall Street has noticed. The investment firm BlackRock, which owns the largest stake in American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, said it has reached out to gun industry executives to see what they plan to do about gun violence. Blackstone Group, another Wall Street investment firm, sent an email to fund managers over the weekend, asking them whether they have any stakes in the gun manufacturers. Other investment firms are renewing efforts to keep gun stocks out of their portfolio — efforts that have been building since the Sandy Hook massacre. The movement is the latest example of American voters channeling their frustration into consumer boycotts when political action fails. Pressure has been building in recent years for Wall Street firms to dump gun stocks — ever since the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting that killed 20 children in 2012. Put simply, divestment is when an organization or individual sells shares of stock in a given company or sector. Activists have been using divestment as a political strategy for decades — as far back as apartheid-era South Africa. Since then, divestment has become a grassroots movement to urge ordinary consumers to invest their retirement savings in ethical ways, and even to use them as vehicles for political change, such as with the divestment movement targeting fossil fuels. It was considered an effective strategy in apartheid South Africa. Opponents of the apartheid regime focused their ire on the companies that were directly invested in the country. They began urging institutional investors, including universities, to divest their assets from companies that did business with the regime. Archbishop Desmond Tutu credited the divestment campaign as a key tactic in bringing down apartheid. The concept of divesting became mainstream in the United States during the climate change debate. Frustration over what was viewed as weak UN climate agreements, plus the US Senate's failure to pass a climate bill in 2010, pushed foundations and nonprofit groups —such as Greenpeace — to ensure their investments were not going to big oil companies. Activist celebrities, like Leonardo DiCaprio, popularized the idea, encouraging Americans to make sure their retirement money was invested in renewable energy. In 2015, a group of foundations launched the DivestInvest initiative, which helps foundations, individuals and businesses divest from fossil fuels. In recent years, gun-control activists have turned to divestiture as a tactic. Rapper Snoop Dogg and angel investor Ron Conway joined the Campaign to Unload, launched in the wake of Sandy Hook and featuring the hashtag #UnloadYour401k. In 2016, two tech workers created Goodbye Gun Stocks, a web app that allowed users to see if their 401(k) savings were invested in gun stocks. One of the creators, Keywon Chung, said she was inspired to take the idea of fossil-fuel divestitures to the gun debate. Asset managers say that more and more Americans have been adamant about restricting firearms companies from these funds. And it’s having an impact. According to a 2016 US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment report, some $845 billion in assets were affected by divestment targeting military contractors and weapons makers. That's a jump of about 1,042 percent since the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012. (Only $74 billion in institutional investments restricted guns at the beginning of 2012.) Calls to divest from Remington, which made the AR-15 used in Sandy Hook, are one factor that pushed the company into bankruptcy. Cerberus, the investment firm that owned the largest stake in the company, told Bloomberg that it decided to sell the company ""amid pressure from investors revolted by the carnage"" in Sandy Hook. Business was bad for gun makers even before the latest mass shooting. Remington announced its bankruptcy on February 12 — two days before the massacre in Parkland. Stocks began to tumble for American Outdoor Brands the day after the Parkland shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, following reports that the weapon used in the shooting was an AR-15 made by the Massachusetts-based company, formerly known as Smith & Wesson. Since then, the company's stocks have dropped about 12.5 percent. Stock prices for the other two big gun makers have dropped too. Gun companies had been struggling ever since Trump won the presidential election. Gun sales normally spike when Democrats are in power, as gun owners’ fears of gun-control measures rise. With Trump in power, sales have fallen. Stock prices for gun manufacturers also tend to rise after mass shootings, likely because the debate over gun control heats up and rekindles fears from gun owners. For example, stock prices for American Outdoor Brands spiked in the week following the 2016 shooting that killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, and again after the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas concert. Reaction to the Parkland shooting seems different. Renewed calls for gun control haven't had the effect of boosting gun stock prices. In fact, they continue to fall.",https://www.vox.com/2018/2/28/17058342/wall-street-gun-stocks-divestment,,Vox
230,230,27-09-16 18:30,2016,9,27,Jennifer Williams,The head of Hezbollah has found someone he hates even more than Israelis,"If there were any doubt as to just how toxic sectarian politics has become in the Middle East, the latest statement from the leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah should clear things right up. Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of a group that has been fighting Israel for decades, declared on Tuesday that “Wahhabism is more evil than Israel,” Lebanon’s Al Akhbar newspaper reported. Wahhabism is the ultra-fundamentalist strain of Sunni Islam that Saudi Arabia’s government promotes and that strongly influences the ideology of Sunni jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. In other words, things have gotten so bad that Hezbollah, Israel’s mortal enemy, now considers Wahhabis — that is, fellow Muslims — to be worse than Israel. Bear in mind, this is coming from the same man who has described Israel as “a cancerous entity and the root of all the crises and wars” and pledged that Israel’s destiny “is manifested in our motto: 'Death to Israel.’” It’s also coming from a man at the helm of a group that has engaged in numerous conflicts with Israel, including a horrifically bloody all-out war in 2006 that resulted in the deaths of around 1,300 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 165 Israelis, 121 of whom were soldiers. Israeli security officials say the group now has the capacity to batter their country with more than 1,000 rockets a day. But despite how it may seem, Nasrallah’s statement is not, at its base, a conflict about religion. Though there are certainly strong religious disagreements between Sunni and Shia — and especially between extreme fundamentalist Sunnis and extreme fundamentalist Shia — the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia has little to do with dogma. It’s actually about something far less exotic: power and influence. Tehran’s Shia government and Riyadh’s Sunni one have spent years waging a Cold War–style proxy fight for dominance of the Middle East and the broader Muslim world. The two countries haven’t openly fought each other, but they back extremist groups around the Middle East who share their worldviews — and who are willing to fight, kill, and die on their behalf. This proxy war plays out in conflicts all over the Middle East. For instance, Saudi Arabia, with US military assistance, is engaged in a brutal air war against Iranian-backed Houthi fighters inside Yemen that has sparked a massive humanitarian crisis in the impoverished country. The United Nations recently estimated that at least 10,000 civilians have died, and acknowledged that that number was almost certainly lower than the actual toll. Saudi Arabia’s proxy fight with Iran is also helping to fuel the bloodshed in Syria, where an estimated 400,000 people have been killed over the past five years while millions more have fled the country and sparked the biggest refugee crisis in decades. Hezbollah — the strongest and most influential of Iran’s various surrogate groups — has sent between 5,000 and 8,000 fighters to Syria on behalf of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against them are myriad secular and Islamist groups, including some more extreme Wahhabi-influenced groups that are being supported by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia wants its preferred groups to topple Assad in order to remove the pro-Iranian leader and install a more Saudi-friendly (preferably Sunni) regime. Iran, naturally, would very much like to prevent that from happening. In the past few weeks, the hottest front in the showdown between Saudi Arabia and Iran has taken place online, in the press, and on social media. The New York Times published a scathing op-ed by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in which Tehran’s top diplomat argued that “the key driver of violence” in the Middle East has been Wahhabism, the “extremist ideology promoted by Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Arabia responded by publishing a series of tweets from its US embassy’s official Twitter account accusing Iran of having “supported violent extremist groups all over the world” and stating that “Iran or its proxies have been blamed for terrorist attacks around the world.” The new statement from Hezbollah’s secretary general may be the latest attack in this ongoing tit-for-tat war of words playing out across the internet, but it won’t be the last. The proxy war between the two countries, sadly, also shows no signs of coming to a peaceful end anytime soon.",https://www.vox.com/world/2016/9/27/13074560/hezbollah-israel-nasrallah-wahhabism-evil,,Vox

Lyft said on Tuesday that Fidelity, the giant mutual fund, would participate in an expanded financing round that now values the company at $11.5 billion. The round, led by Alphabet affiliate CapitalG, was previously only expected to collect $1 billion; it now stands to raise $1.5 billion. Shareholders typically try to avoid conflicts of interest in their investments, but when it comes to Uber and Lyft it seems like all’s fair. Alphabet, for example, is also invested in both Uber and Lyft. Fidelity declined to comment. Fidelity’s ownership position in Uber is almost certainly much larger than its position in Lyft — Fidelity led $1.2 billion Uber’s Series D financing round in 2014. Notably, Fidelity was a key investor that helped oust Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick this summer. Lyft and Uber are locked in a tightening battle for market share in the U.S. and are both stockpiling cash to win it. Lyft does not need the cash right now — but investments in frontier areas like autonomous vehicles demand a healthy war chest and Lyft is accepting the cash when it is on the table. Uber is itself preparing to take on at least $1 billion in new investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. SoftBank has threatened to also invest in Lyft if it is unable to close its Uber investment. Axios earlier reported the expanded financing round.

232,232,07-12-17 00:00,2017,12,7,"Richard Cowan, Jeff Mason",Congress averts government shutdown for now,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved rapidly on Thursday to send President Donald Trump a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown this weekend, leaving fights over budget priorities and a range of other controversial issues for the coming weeks.  The House of Representatives, working against a Friday midnight deadline, approved legislation in a 235-193 vote to fund a wide range of federal programs through Dec. 22.   The Senate followed up by approving the bill 81-14. The White House has said Trump will sign it into law.  The measure creates more time for a reckoning between Republicans and Democrats about budget differences, which Trump discussed in a meeting with leading lawmakers at the White House earlier in the day.  “We hope that we’re going to make some great progress for our country. I think that will happen,” Trump said.  The White House said negotiations would resume on Friday.  Leaders now have about two weeks to find common ground on a host of thorny issues for the next government funding bill in order to prevent a partial government shutdown on Dec. 23.  Both sides want to avoid having parts of the government close, particularly during the holidays, for fear of a public backlash, and leaders from both parties have preemptively blamed the other for such a potential outcome.   That political blame game is likely to continue in the next two weeks while, behind the scenes, leaders hammer out a compromise.    Republicans mainly want a big increase in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2018. But Democrats are insisting that any added Pentagon funding be accompanied by increases to other domestic programs.  Democrats also want to enact into law protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought into the United States.   Republicans want a much wider series of immigration law changes to further clamp down on foreign arrivals, and they want immigration negotiations to be held on a separate track from the government funding bill.  Democrats also want to shore up the Affordable Care Act, known as “Obamacare,” by reviving federal subsidies for low-income people in the program.  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer joined Trump and Republican congressional leaders for the talks after canceling a similarly planned meeting last week when the president posted a note on Twitter attacking their policy positions.  The two Democrats said in a statement that the meeting on Thursday was productive but nothing specific had been agreed. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis joined the group to discuss military matters.  The White House foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told Reuters.   He said the White House wants a deal that covers spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.    Earlier on Thursday, Schumer said Trump seemed to be rooting for a shutdown and warned that, if one occurs, “it will fall on his shoulders.”   “His party controls the Senate, the House and the presidency,” he said. “Nobody here wants to see a shutdown. We Democrats are not interested in one.”  Pelosi said Democrats were not willing to shut down the government over the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, but she also said “we will not leave here without a DACA fix.”  Reporting by Richard Cowan and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney, Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-shutdown/congress-averts-government-shutdown-for-now-idUSKBN1E11DU,Politics,Reuters
233,233,22-05-19 17:20,2019,5,22,Aja Romano,"Review: Disney’s live-action Aladdin is half charming, half dreadful","How do you solve a problem like Aladdin? Disney’s questionable live-action remake of its acclaimed 1992 animated film, which finally hits theaters May 24, has been dogged by controversy and skepticism since before production even began. Director Guy Ritchie, known for action comedies but not musicals, seemed an unlikely choice to direct the story, especially given the tricky cultural nuances involved. Casting Will Smith as an infrequently blue genie also raised plenty of eyebrows. But more crucially, the 1992 film Aladdin seemed a completely unsuitable candidate for Disney’s series of live-action remakes. There’s too much about the original film that’s lightning in a bottle, impossible to recreate. The 1992 film’s 2D animated effects, at the time sophisticated and dazzling, are now largely passé. (2D animation is a dying style, and the computer effects that looked thrillingly state-of-the-art 27 years ago now look sadly dated.) Its reliance on Robin Williams’s genius improvisational skills led to its whip-smart, slightly manic screenplay, which was completely overhauled and frenetically rewritten under tight time constraints, not unlike the notorious crunch times that video game developers often push through today. Then there’s the collaborative gifts of Disney’s musical auteurs, composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman. Ashman originally pitched the film to Disney, but died during its development; Menken contributed the score to the new film but only one new song, with lyrics by songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. 2019’s Aladdin tries its best to regenerate that magic, and to its credit, it finds some success. It is frequently quite charming, largely thanks to the efforts of Mena Massoud, who captures Aladdin’s irrepressible charisma every second he’s onscreen. Much of the new story material written for the film works, and it’s enjoyable, if pedestrian, family fare. But the terrible musical sequences, the lackluster CGI, and the strange creative and emotional restraint that permeates the film frequently flatten Disney’s original Aladdin into a cardboard version of itself. The result is a film that’s divided into two entirely different entities. One is pretty cute: a pleasantly bland rom-com, with Massoud’s Aladdin and Naomi Scott’s Jasmine as adorable kids in love. The other is a really crappy musical, presided over by a disappointingly hamstrung Will Smith. These two halves never fully cohere. It’s important to acknowledge going into the Aladdin remake that, for all the 1992 film was a delightful, hilarious animated musical masterpiece, it was also dripping in Orientalism and harmful racist depictions of Arab culture. In the original Aladdin, Jasmine is a repressed princess whose ultimate aim is to gain enough independence to marry for love rather than political expediency, which made her strikingly evolved for the time but seems hopelessly limiting now. Her father, the sultan, is a babbling, easily directed man-child. The citizens of Agrabah are frequently depicted as barbarous sword-wielders and sexualized belly dancers. The opening song, “Arabian Nights,” originally contained the ridiculously racist line “They cut off your ear if they don’t like your face / It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.” So it’s easy to see why Disney executives might feel that Aladdin is worth updating, if only to overwrite many of its problematic elements. But this particular remake fumbled from the start. Advocacy groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations were opposed to the film from its inception. Casting controversy threw further doubt on the whole project, as did a series of lifeless promotional photos and a recently released clip of a strangely sluggish musical performance from the film, featuring new genie Will Smith. None of this boded well for the film. Still, Ritchie and his fellow screenwriter, frequent Tim Burton collaborator John August, put in a decent effort to gloss over the previous film’s most glaring faults. On paper, Ritchie’s Aladdin offers several modern improvements: The script is especially good to Jasmine, who’s no longer the only woman in the movie and now has long-term political ambitions. The genie, who reads as culturally Arab, has a personal life and dreams of his own beyond escaping the lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine bond over growing up parentless. Hot Jafar (his official name, sorry, I don’t make the rules) doesn’t just want abstract power; he also wants to invade a few neighboring countries, because why not. These changes are clearly meant to give Aladdin additional depth; in execution, however, many of these details seem like superficial inserts. The sultan’s palace seems to be an amalgam of Muslim and South Asian cultures, probably because Scott is of South Asian descent; her dance sequences are explicitly Bollywood-flavored. This could have been an interesting opportunity for an explicit exploration of the way these two cultures interact, but the film rarely goes deeper than, uh, giving Jasmine a feminist power ballad. Throughout the first half hour or so of Aladdin, I started to think it might be able to pull out a win. The opening sequence, where we meet Aladdin as an impressively clean thief living on the streets of Agrabah, unfolds at a clip. While it can’t quite shake the vibe of a local community theater troupe hastily assembling on a soundstage, it’s still fun. We’re quickly introduced to the budding romance between Aladdin and a disguised Princess Jasmine, who bond over petty thievery and dead parents while zipping through streets and hopping across buildings as they evade capture by Agrabah street police. It’s the kind of colorful meet-cute that wouldn’t be out of place in a Netflix “summer of love” flick, and it worked for me. In fact, I would probably watch that rom-com multiple times and reblog a few Tumblr GIF sets of their love. At nearly all other times, however, the film suffers from an inexplicable sluggishness. Ritchie’s recent filmography, dating from 2009’s Sherlock Holmes, has emphasized zany foreground antics cosseted by rich background details and strong pacing. But Aladdin frequently moves slowly, almost as if Ritchie has chosen to take the film on a leisurely stroll in direct contrast to its predecessor’s high speed. This holds true not just for the musical numbers, which all seem to have been slowed down in tempo and energy, but also the big action sequences between Hot Jafar and everyone else. Watching the film, I frequently wondered, in fact, if Hot Jafar actor Marwan Kenzari were controlling the pace of the scenes through his refusal to turn his character into a campy, over-the-top villain. The original Jafar was the epitome of the noxious trope of the shrieking, fey, vaguely homophobic Disney villain; Kenzari’s Jafar is quiet, straightforward, and almost affectless, except for occasional moments when he lets his thirst for power seep through. This is a satisfying reinterpretation of Jafar, but his emotional restraint seems to be contagious. There are entire scenes, particularly near the end, where characters who should be fighting tooth and nail for what they want instead stand still and calmly reflect on what they each want to do next. It’s largely inexplicable behavior, and speaks to just how overly staid Ritchie’s direction is. CGI Abu (the monkey): Meh. CGI Magic Carpet: Perfect! 10/10, would ride. CGI visual backgrounds: Flat and unimpressive, particularly during the cave sequence and “A Whole New World.” CGI Rajah (the tiger): Delightful! 10/10, would pet. CGI Iago (the parrot): Disappointing, though more because the film mostly excised his wisecracking personality rather than because of how he looks. CGI “Friend Like Me”: Abysmal on a scale that must be seen to understand. But it’s the musical numbers in particular that seem completely deflated. It’s not just that they’re slow; it’s also that Smith’s voice doesn’t carry them like WIlliams’s did, and his lack of live stage experience really hurts him here — as does the lackluster CGI imagery overall, which makes his “phenomenal cosmic power” seem kinda drab. “Friend Like Me” especially seems uninspired visually and thematically, while “Prince Ali” has already been widely ridiculed on social media for its slow pacing and dearth of jubilance. The other songs also suffer from this weird malaise; “A Whole New World” passed by before I really even noticed it was happening. Smith, moreover, seems to be blocked creatively in his role as Genie, who comes across as a thin character despite the extra layers of characterization given to him in the new script. To be fair, it’s hard to conceive of anyone who could step into a role this iconic, played so brilliantly by Williams, and not be intimidated out of all self-expression, but Smith also quite understandably seems to present his character as spiritually worn down by his enslavement. Far from being a genie who projects phenomenal cosmic power, Smith’s interpretation is occasionally socially awkward, and human above all else. And that underscores the remake’s biggest single issue. Turning a blue cartoon into a flesh-and-blood human being imposes a sense of realism that the glib, fantastical storyline of Aladdin was never really meant to reckon with. The original “Aladdin” tale, after all, was most likely translated from a Syrian oral tradition relayed by an 18th-century French writer, who drenched his version in exoticism. The 1992 film, in turn, succeeded on the basis of its sheer disconnect from reality, which kept it fun and magical. The cartoon was divorced from its story’s real-life connections, something the live-action take can’t evade. It’s possible to imagine a new animated remake of Aladdin that confronts the Disney classic’s fraught past and manages to jettison much of its cultural baggage in a way that feels justified and transformative. Unfortunately, a live-action adaptation was never going to pull that off. I’m left mourning the infectious, charming, no-baggage, original rom-com Disney could have given us instead. Aladdin is in theaters on May 24.",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18634316/disneys-aladdin-remake-review-rating,,Vox
234,234,01-04-18 00:00,2018,4,1,"Ben Blanchard, Tony Munroe",China hits U.S. goods with tariffs as 'sparks' of trade war fly,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, escalating a dispute between the world’s biggest economies in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel.   The tariffs, which take effect on Monday, were announced late on Sunday by China’s finance ministry and matched a list of possible tariffs on up to $3 billion in U.S. goods published by China on March 23.  Soon after the announcement, an editorial in the widely read Global Times newspaper warned that if the United States had thought China would not retaliate or would only take symbolic countermeasures, it could “say goodbye to that delusion”.  “Even though China and the U.S. have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,” the newspaper said.  The Ministry of Commerce said it was suspending its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce tariffs on 120 U.S. goods, including fruit and ethanol. The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.  Eight other products, including pork and scrap aluminum, would now be subject to additional tariffs of 25 percent, it said, with the measures effective starting April 2.      “China’s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard China’s interests,” the finance ministry said.   China is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tension with the United States, which has rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors fear a full-blown trade dispute between the two economic superpowers will damage world growth.  In response to China’s move, Washington said Beijing’s subsidies and overcapacity were behind the action on steel.  “Instead of targeting fairly traded U.S. exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S national security and distorting global markets,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.  U.S. President Donald Trump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese goods following an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act.   The U.S. administration says China has systematically misappropriated American intellectual property - allegations China denies.      About the Section 301 investigation, China had “yet to unsheathe its sword,” the official Xinhua news agency said.  Sometime this week, the Trump administration is expected to unveil a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.  U.S. technology industry officials said they expected the list to target products that benefit from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” program, which aims to upgrade the domestic manufacturing base with more advanced products.   China has repeatedly promised to open its economy further, but many foreign companies complain of unfair treatment. China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandora’s Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe.  “There are some people in the West who think that China looks tough for the sake of a domestic audience, and would easily make concessions,” the Global Times said.   “But they are wrong.”  The Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect government policy.  Reaction to China’s measures varied on social media, with some saying Chinese customers would be the ones to ultimately pay for a trade war.   “Why not directly target soybean and planes? The tariffs that China announced today don’t sound a lot to me,” said a user on the Weibo microblog platform.  Aircraft and soybeans were China’s biggest U.S. imports by value last year.   In a statement published on Monday morning, the commerce ministry said the United States had “seriously violated” the principles of nondiscrimination enshrined in World Trade Organization rules, and had also damaged China’s interests.  “China’s suspension of some of its obligations to the United States is its legitimate right as a member of the World Trade Organization,” it said, adding that differences should be resolved through negotiation.   Weibo prominently featured the list of U.S. goods that China is targeting among the day’s “hot” trending topics.   “I will never buy fruit from the U.S.,” a Weibo user wrote.

It’s true that Trump’s comment last week was preceded by a sheriff mentioning MS-13, but Trump also phrased his remark in a way that left the meaning open to interpretation. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country,” Trump said. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.

Paris - Archaeologists said Tuesday they had discovered the remains of victims from a 6,000-year-old massacre in Alsace in eastern France that was likely carried out by ""furious ritualized warriors"". The corpses of 10 people were found outside Strasbourg in one of 300 ancient ""silos"" used to store grain and other food, a team from France's National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap) told reporters. The Neolithic group appeared to have died violent deaths, with multiple injuries to their legs, hands and skulls. The way in which the bodies were piled on top of each other suggested they had been killed together and dumped in the silo. ""They were very brutally executed and received violent blows, almost certainly from a stone axe,"" said Philippe Lefranc, an Inrap specialist on the period. The skeletons of five adults and one adolescent were found, as well as four arms from different individuals. The arms were likely ""war trophies"" like those found at a nearby burial site of Bergheim in 2012, said Lefranc. He said the mutilations indicated a society of ""furious ritualized warriors"", while the silos were stored within a defence wall that pointed towards ""a troubled time, a period of insecurity"". It is hoped that genetic testing on the bones will reveal more information about the killings, but Lefranc said one theory was that a local tribe had clashed with a new group arriving from the area around modern-day Paris. ""It appears that a warrior raid by people from the Parisian basin went wrong for the assailants, and the Alsatians of the era massacred them,"" he said. However, in the long run, it was the ""Parisians"" who had the last laugh. The local tribe appear to have been supplanted by the newcomers around 4,200 BC, as demonstrated by new funeral rites, pottery and hamlets.",https://www.businessinsider.com/afp-france-unearths-bones-from-6000-yr-old-neolithic-massacre-2016-6,,Business Insider

Panicking and ordering something you don't like at dinner because you don't want to hold anyone up. Pretending to understand what someone says the second time because it'd be embarrassing to ask again. Silently working out the hygiene levels of everyone on the top deck of the bus before you sit down. As a people, being awkward defines the British more than ""tea"" or ""queuing"" or any of the twee stuff you'll find in listicles titled ""23 British Quirks Every 'Sherlock' Fan Knows to Be True"". A new study that was inexplicably commissioned to work out the ideal distances people from different countries would like you to stand away from them has gone one jot further to confirming this. The closest a Brit can stand next to a stranger without feeling uncomfortable, the study found, is three feet. Any closer and we begin to fret. Mind you, we're not the most awkward by any means, ranking 26th in a list of 42 countries for the ideal distance away we'd like to be from a conversational partner. Researchers at the University of Wroclaw in Poland, using the testimonies of 9,000 people, found that Romanians want the biggest gap, at 1.39 metres, while Argentines are the most relaxed, saying they can stand as close at 76.5cm away before feeling uncomfortable.   The study said cultural differences could be behind the differences, but that other factors were probably at play. Generally, those in warmer countries were more likely to want to stand closer, while older generations and women prefer to stand further away.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bm4bj4/brits-dont-want-you-to-come-any-closer-than-three-feet,The VICE Guide to Right Now,Vice
239,239,13-01-17 00:00,2017,1,13,Javier Cabral,LA's 'Spirit Guide' Will Lead You Through Your Favorite Poisons,"""Just nose it. What food does it remind you of? Lemon cake? Brown sugar? This is a judgement-free zone, so let's all have at it.""  I am standing in front of Pedro Shanahan at Caña Rum Bar's patio in downtown Los Angeles. A group of about 35 men and women of various ages from all around the city have showed up to participate in one of his legendary Spirit Society tastings. Tonight's spirit is rum—specifically limited, private selections of aged rums from Panama, Barbados, and Guadeloupe bottled by Berry Bros & Rudd Rum that average well over $100 a bottle.  As the small staff of the rum bar start to pass along small snifter glasses filled with an ounce of each rum, people start to shout out random flavor profiles: ""Vanilla!"" ""Cinnamon!"" ""Tobacco!"" Shanahan acknowledges each response and then continues with, ""That's right! Remember, everyone's set of taste buds is different, and a lot of it revolves around your own heritage, so there are no wrong answer, let's all keep going!"" All of Shanahan's public tastings have this sort of laidback vibe, whether he's sampling rare rums, Scotches, mezcals, tequilas, or more mainstream bourbons and whiskeys. This is because underneath his extremely chill demeanor lies 18 years of bartending experience, during which he worked with some of the most notable bartenders and establishments in Los Angeles. It was that same bartending career, however, that made him burn out and lead him down the road to become 213 Hospitality's ""Spirit Guide"" (actual job title). His resume includes OK'ing the 800 whiskeys for LA's iconic whiskey bar Seven Grand and overseeing the rest of the spirits used throughout the entire 213 Hospitality empire. (Thus, the first Spirit Society sessions were strictly about whiskey.) Now, the man's goal with weekly tastings is to create community within spirits and bring people together, and to take away the pretense that can come along with some liquors. When he is done with the rum tasting, I ask him a little more about his goal for these extravagant tastings, where they never shy away from pouring you a little bit extra if you ask nicely. ""Some people might think that because our bars have leather booths and dark woods, that it is only a place for old, rich white people,"" he tells me. ""But I'm really not from this world, nor do I want anyone to think that the world of spirits is exclusive in any way."" He adds that the production and consumption of alcohol has historically helped to foster community throughout the world.  His ethos toward alcohol is one up as a skater playing in punk rock bands in Eugene, Oregon.""Our society has grown around alcohol and it has always brought humans together. I'm just trying to tear away at all of the elitist, classist, sexist marketing that booze has gone through."" His strategy in making booze approachable to all is simple: Ask what people are tasting instead of telling them what they are supposed to be tasting. ""Some people have never had some of the flavor profiles that are described on the back of labels. I just want people to know that whatever they are tasting is cool, too."" This lofty goal is seemingly becoming a reality. During another tasting that showcased some special selections of Nikka Japanese whisky at Bar Jackalope, the crowd of 75 varied from downtown executives in expensive suits to 20-somethings with hoodies who drove all the way from south and east LA. In this tasting, there were seven whiskeys being generously poured, including a special, one-off bottle that the Nikka whisky presenter made by accumulating the ends of many different Nikka whiskies over the years. The excess in booze in this tasting resulted in an even more communal environment, with even more conversations between total strangers. ""Booze has always been by the people and for the people. I just want to remind people of this fact. Whiskey is and will always be for everybody,"" he tells me later.

240,240,31-07-18 00:00,2018,7,31,"Ahmad Sultan, Abdul Qadir Sediqi",At least 15 killed as gunmen attack Afghan government building,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed on Tuesday in Afghanistan’s eastern city of Jalalabad when gunmen stormed a government building, trapping dozens inside after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate, officials and witnesses said.  The attack underlines the country’s dire security situation after 17 years of war. Islamic State increasingly claims attacks on civilian targets even as pressure builds for peace talks between the Western-backed government and the Taliban.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though the Taliban issued a statement denying involvement.  After several hours during which intermittent gunfire and explosions could be heard, provincial government spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said the incident appeared to be over with two gunmen killed and much of the building destroyed.  He said at least 15 people had been killed and 15 wounded although the total may rise as rescue workers search the site. Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said eight had been killed and as many as 30 wounded.  The International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization working in Afghanistan, said one of its staff, a water and sanitation engineer, was among the dead.   One witness, a passerby named Obaidullah, said the attack began when a black car with three occupants pulled up at the entrance to a building used by the department of refugee affairs and a gunman emerged, firing around him.  One attacker blew himself up at the gate and two gunmen entered the building, in an area close to shops and government offices, he added.  Minutes later, the car blew up, wounding people in the street, Obaidullah said.  “We saw several people wounded and helped to carry them away,” he added.  As security forces cordoned off the area, gunshots and what appeared to be hand grenade explosions could be heard as a cloud of black smoke drifted into the sky.  Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said about 40 people appeared to have been caught inside the building, which caught fire early in the attack.  As the attack concluded, it was not immediately clear what had happened to them. Islamic State has claimed a number of recent attacks in the city.  Khogyani said the attack happened during a meeting with NGOs working on refugee-related issues. The head of the department and several other people were taken to safety, he said.  Although it is unclear whether there is any direct connection, Islamic State attacks have picked up as hopes for peace talks between the government and the Taliban have grown in the wake of last month’s three-day ceasefire.  The attacks have been concentrated in Jalalabad, the main city of Nangarhar province, on the border with Pakistan where Islamic State fighters first appeared towards the end of 2014.  The casualties add to a mounting toll in Afghanistan. In the western province of Farah, 11 people were killed when their bus was hit by a roadside bomb, officials said.   Also on Tuesday, unknown attackers seized 22 people from vehicles on a highway linking Kabul and Gardez, a key city in the eastern province of Paktia.

241,241,23-01-19 20:08,2019,1,23,Alex Abad-Santos,Bryan Singer sexual assault allegations: 4 men accuse the director of sexually assaulting underage boys,"In a report published in the Atlantic, four men have accused director Bryan Singer of sexually assaulting them while they were underage. The alleged assaults took place in California between 1997 and 1999. Singer is the credited director of Bohemian Rhapsody and is known for directing films like X-Men, X2, and The Usual Suspects. The Atlantic’s report details the Hollywood circles Singer was reportedly part of during the late ’90s, the boys he met and parties he threw during that time period, the allegations of sexual assault of underage boys, and an alleged pattern of abuse that wrecked the accusers’ lives. It was written by Alex French and Maximillian Potter — a writer at large and editor at large for Esquire, respectively — who say they spent 12 months reporting the story and spoke to more than 50 sources about the allegations. Singer’s lawyer Andrew Brettler denied the allegations against his client, stating to French and Potter that Singer has never been arrested or convicted of any crime and that he categorically denies ever having sex with, or a preference for, underage men. Singer, through his lawyer, told Vox the story is a “homophobic smear piece [that] has been conveniently timed to take advantage of [Bohemian Rhapsody’s] success” and that it was written by “a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997.” French and Potter tell the stories of four men who had previously never spoken publicly about their allegations against Singer. One of those men is Victor Valdovinos, who told French and Potter that when he was 13, he worked as an extra on Singer’s 1998 film Apt Pupil. Valdovinos says that during a day of filming a locker room scene that required partial nudity, Singer molested him multiple times. Per the Atlantic: According to Valdovinos, Singer reached through the towel flaps and “grabbed my genitals and started masturbating it.” The director also “rubbed his front part on me,” Valdovinos alleges. “He did it all with this smile.” Valdovinos says that Singer told him, “You’re so good-looking … I really want to work with you … I have a nice Ferrari … I’m going to take care of you.” “I was frozen. Speechless,” Valdovinos continues. “He came back to where I was in the locker room throughout the day to molest me.” The other three men in the story were given pseudonyms for fear of retaliation. One of those men, identified as “Andy,” says he was 15 when he met Singer through Marc Collins-Rector, a purported friend of Singer’s and a convicted sex offender. Andy told French and Potter that he and Singer had sex the first night they met, and multiple times after: “I just remember how loud the moaning was. I remember thinking, God, there’s a big group of people downstairs hanging out in the living room, and they can probably hear him. That bothered me, so I stuck my hand over his mouth or in his mouth just to stop it. When we went downstairs, it was really awkward. I just acted like it was no big thing.” Another man, identified as “Ben,” told the writers he met Singer at one of Singer’s parties. Ben said he was 17 or 18 when Singer coerced him to perform oral sex on him. “He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,” Ben told French and Potter. “He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.” Ben also said “it wasn’t a hold-you-down-and-rape-you situation.” The fourth man, identified as “Eric,” alleges that he and Singer had sex when Eric was 17, and that he witnessed a system in which young boys were brought to Singer and his friends to curry favor. “If you weren’t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,” Eric said. These are not the first allegations of sexual misconduct that have surfaced against Singer. In 2014, two men filed lawsuits against Singer accusing him of sexually assaulting them while they were underage. Those lawsuits were later dismissed. Then in 2017, Singer denied accusations by Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, a 31-year-old man from Washington, who filed a lawsuit saying that Singer raped him when he was 17, on a yacht sailing from Lake Union to Lake Washington in Seattle. And in October 2018, Singer posted a message on Instagram warning of a “negative article” from Esquire about him and implied that it was a publicity-seeking opportunity timed to the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, which came out on November 2. A post shared by Bryan Singer (@bryanjaysinger) on Oct 15, 2018 at 2:06am PDT According to the Hollywood Reporter, Singer was fired from the project in December 2017, a few weeks before filming ended, after he clashed with star Rami Malek and disappeared from the set. Singer said his absence was due to wanting to care for a sick parent. Because of Directors Guild of America rules, only one director or team can be credited for directing a film, and Singer remains the sole credited director for Bohemian Rhapsody. It appears that Singer’s October Instagram post may have been referencing Potter and French, who are both named on Esquire’s masthead. Though Potter and French originally reported the story for Esquire, it was later brought to the Atlantic, where, according to a spokesperson for the magazine, it went through the publication’s legal vetting and fact-checking process. Singer, in a statement made through his lawyer, disparaged the piece, calling into question the credibility of the writers, accusers, and editors: The last time I posted about this subject, Esquire magazine was preparing to publish an article written by a homophobic journalist who has a bizarre obsession with me dating back to 1997. After careful fact-checking and, in consideration of the lack of credible sources, Esquire chose not to publish this piece of vendetta journalism. That didn’t stop this writer from selling it to The Atlantic. It’s sad that The Atlantic would stoop to this low standard of journalistic integrity. Again, I am forced to reiterate that this story rehashes claims from bogus lawsuits filed by a disreputable cast of individuals willing to lie for money or attention. And it is no surprise that, with Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success. The writers of the piece responded, and said that the piece was fact-checked at Esquire but then Hearst executives killed the article. The move then let them publish at The Atlantic: Statement from reporters Maximillian Potter and Alex French on investigation of Bryan Singer published in @TheAtlantic: pic.twitter.com/iouvNZGQtz Singer has not been involved in promoting Bohemian Rhapsody on the awards circuit. The movie was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture on January 22, and its star Malek was nominated for Best Actor. It previously won Best Drama at the Golden Globes. Also on January 22, Malek distanced himself from Singer, telling People that he “was not aware of” any allegations against Singer before working on Bohemian Rhapsody. Singer is still slated to direct an upcoming Red Sonja remake.

244,244,09-01-19 19:31,2019,1,9,Eric Johnson,Jon Lovett explains why Democrats in Congress probably won’t regulate Facebook,"On the latest episode of Pivot, Recode’s Kara Swisher traded in Scott Galloway for a guest co-host: Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett, the co-host of Pod Save America and host of Lovett or Leave It. They talked about everything from Trump’s shutdown to Netflix’s Bird Box, and why the newly Democratic-controlled House of Representatives probably won’t make a move to regulate tech giants like Facebook. “I think if you were to ask a bunch of Democrats off the record, like do you think these companies should be regulated, they’d all say yes,” Lovett said. “How many of them want to make it happen? How many of them really want to devote their resources and attention to it? “You look at what animates Democratic voters, you look at what animates Democratic politicians, it’s health care, it’s increasingly climate. It is wages and economic issues, it’s issues around reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform and inequality,” he added. “But regulating Mark Zuckerberg, right now ... There’s a lot of press releases and hand-wringing but you don’t really hear a big coherent case.” You can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Jon. Kara Swisher: Hi everyone. This is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I’m Kara Swisher, welcome to Pivot 2019. This week, Scott Galloway is out and my friend Jon Lovett from Crooked Media is here. Hello, Jon. Jon Lovett: Hello, Kara. You’re stepping into the co-host chair. Jon hosts a number of his own fantastic podcasts including Pod Save America and ... Lovett or Leave It. Exactly. And we’re here at their headquarters in Los Angeles, at the Crooked Media headquarters, and I’m having a great time and I appreciate you doing this for me. Thanks for coming. Look, people clamor for ... You and I. For us to be together. Because we have such a spark, right? We have such a spark. It’s electric. It’s electric right now. You don’t know what’s going on in the studio right now. But, thank you for the ultimate podcast crossover episode. So, I sort of gave you an idea of what we do here on Pivot, but it’s just exactly talking about the big story shake-downs. Then we talk about predictions and wins and fails of the week and I just, you’re so opinionated. I think you can agree with me on that one. Sure. That you will have lots of opinions. There’s so much in the news now that you can discuss. We’re going to focus obviously on political stuff, but whatever you want to talk about. And so, let’s do first the big story breakdown. Obviously the government shutdown for you all, is that correct, and stuff like that. I want to pivot it towards tech legislation, because I think it’s never going to happen now because they can’t even decide on lunch in Washington. Yeah. So, talk about that big story. The Democrats taking over the house, Nancy Pelosi was elected speaker of the House again. Yes. Tell us where we are with this big story. So, let’s talk about the shutdown. Okay. You know, Donald Trump has, over the past two years, kind of had a pattern — whether it’s with DACA and the DREAMers, the Paris Climate Accords, the Iran deal, now this shutdown, several other issues — he knows instinctively that his comfort with cruelty, with damage, gives him leverage. He does know that. However, he doesn’t ever seem to have the discipline or follow-through to say, “Okay, I will threaten to deport children who did nothing wrong and were brought here by their parents.” Right. To get a deal. But then, when that deal is put on the table, when Democrats say, “You know what? If you’ll protect DREAMers and come to the table on immigration, we’ll give you money for border security.” He walks away. It’s never good enough. He talks about renegotiating deals. NAFTA, right? He threatens to pull out of NAFTA, they make some cosmetic changes to NAFTA. Now with this shutdown, he sits down in the Oval Office with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and says, “I’m going to shut the government down over border security.” Over the wall. Over the wall. Or steel slats or whatever. Over steel slats. “I’m the one that’s going to do it. You want open borders, I want the wall. Call me Mr. Shutdown. I’m king shutdown, shutdown man.” Government shuts down. Well, what’s the plan? Because you know, the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis by a voice vote, which basically means 100 percent of the Senators got behind a bipartisan deal that included much less funding for border security. He then makes this threat. Paul Ryan, in one of his last acts, perfect last act for him, goes along with it. Right. Twizzling Paul Ryan, goes along with this ... the word is fakakta. It’s a fakakta plan. And the government has been shut down. I am very glad that Paul Ryan left the government as a capitulating supplicant to Donald Trump while the government was shutdown, while the debt hit record levels, right? Every single thing Paul Ryan claimed to care about. And the stock market. And the stock market took a huge hit. Every single thing that Paul Ryan claims to have cared about and been a leader on was damaged by his time. Good-bye, Paul. Good-bye. Don’t let the door hit you. Right. You know what? Let it hit you ... on your way to the gym. Let the door hit you on the way out. We got that. Buns of steel, let the door hit you. Listen, for two years, in my mind I had just been waiting for the moment where Nancy Pelosi takes the gavel from Paul Ryan’s fucking hands and today, it happened. So, you look at Donald Trump ... Did he give it to her? No, because he’s not in Congress anymore. Kevin McCarthy handed it over, which is much less satisfying, let’s be honest about it. That guy. Look at what Donald Trump did in the intervening time between an old Congress and a new Congress. He shut the government down over border security. He had two years of unified Congress, couldn’t get this kind of thing through. Nancy Pelosi just took the gavel. Did it get easier to get your money? Of course not. Of course not, especially because we know that the Senate already passed a bipartisan bill that the House can now pass a version of. So, he basically does what he does. What Donald Trump does, he shoots the hostage, now the hostage is lying on the ground bleeding. He doesn’t have a plan for how to get his ransom. So, that’s where we are right now. I don’t think anyone really knows how it’s going to shake out. Donald Trump is dug in but ... So, what’s going to happen? What is from you guys, you guys talk about this a lot on Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It. What’s going to happen then? I don’t know. I don’t have a prediction. What has happened over the past few years is there’s a lot of bluster around shutdowns, about shutdowns going on forever and how you’ll be blamed and I won’t be blamed. But Donald Trump went into this shutdown taking the blame for it. In the end, they choose to give in in some way. Right. It’s a hard thing to know how this actually shakes out, what kind of fig leaf Donald Trump will claim in order to reopen the government. I don’t really know, but it certainly doesn’t end with Nancy Pelosi’s, one of her first acts as Democratic Speaker, giving Donald Trump his $5 billion unless there’s some new big deal on immigration — which, again, feels very unlikely because, again, that deal was killed by Donald Trump before. So, they can’t do anything. One of the things that we’ve been talking a lot about this year on Pivot is the idea of tech legislation, privacy legislation, any legislation making these giant platforms more accountable. That seems impossible at this point, right? I mean, yeah. Look, they can’t seem to agree on basic functioning of the government. There’s not a bipartisan basis for that legislation right now. Republicans control the Senate. Even Democratic Senators, if I’m being honest, there’s not many of them have taken up the mantel. You know, it’s something ... Senator Warner. Warner, of course, has been a leader about this and said interesting things about it. But even he has been, you know, he has taken his time in reaching the point of saying that these companies need more regulation. People like Brian Schatz who are really smart messengers and are really smart about thinking through what the next Democratic position should be has been talking about this more. But ultimately, the place that I’m interested in this debate taking place is the 2020 field and how this plays out amongst Democrats, because not only is a lot of this dependent on electing a Democratic president especially when we don’t have control of the Senate, that is also where a lot of the most important policy debates move forward, is in Democratic primaries. That’s what we saw in health care. I think that’s this time what we’ll see on tech, on monopoly, that I think ... Do you think that is going to be a big issue or has tech kind of gotten out of, gotten away from paying the price for this? Because Nancy, I had talked to Nancy Pelosi and she talked about this internet bill of rights and Democrats now are much tougher on tech, right? They’ve shifted. They were the best friends of tech and then they moved away from it. Yeah, I think it’s a really good question. I think this is one of those places where you see the cost of Democratic leadership, Congressional leadership, generally being older. They’re not as fluent in this conversation. I also think it’s taking time for this idea to kind of move through the system. I think if you were to ask a bunch of Democrats off the record, like do you think these companies should be regulated, they’d all say yes. How many of them want to make it happen? How many of them really want to devote their resources and attention to it? It’s not been ... When there’s so many other things. When there’s so many other things. I mean, you look at what animates Democratic voters, you look at what animates Democratic politicians, it’s health care, it’s increasingly climate. It is wages and economic issues, it’s issues around reproductive freedom and criminal justice reform and inequality. But regulating Mark Zuckerberg, right now, it does feel like a lot of the patter ... Regulating Mark Zuckerberg. That sounds terrible. Sound like the name of your book. Yes. There’s a lot of press releases and hand-wringing but you don’t really hear a big coherent case for here’s what the future of regulation on these issues ... Right, No. I agree. It’s going to happen in the states, like Gavin Newsom and California and places ... even if it does happen, because there’s so many other issues. Yeah, I also think it’s tied into a larger, much harder conversation about corporate power generally and corporate power inside of the Democratic party. And I think that’s partly why I’ve looked to the 2020 field as a place to have this debate, is I think the need to rein in Facebook, the need to rein in the monopolistic power that a lot of these companies have is going to be part of a larger conversation about the influence of money in politics, about the concentration of wealth, about corporate consolidation. And you know, Elizabeth Warren, that’s part of her ... Yeah, just announced. I was going to ask about that, enters the presidential race. Yeah. She enters the presidential race. You know, even Nancy Pelosi, her speech today taking the speakership talked about the concentration of wealth. So I think that’s going to be, I hope ... And guess where the wealth is. And I hope one of the big ... I think corporate power and corporate concentration, as it applies to tech companies, as it applies to Amazon, as it applies to banks, as it applies to telecom, as it applies to all these different industries, is to me the sleeper issue. It’s not that it’s not being talked about, but it is to me the place where Democrats can really say, “This is now not a part of our program, but a centerpiece of how we talk about ...” Will they turn on tech? I mean, they seem to be, Cory Booker does, you know, some of them are really starting to beyond ... Yeah, I don’t think it’s necessarily about turning on tech. I think it’s about saying, “Well, hold on a second.” You know, you guys have been ... the tech companies have been so unwilling to even define what they are, to avoid the conversation about where they fit and their power. They’re reluctant to talk about it, while at the same time exploiting it, building businesses off it, building great wealth off of it. So, I don’t think it’s about turning on tech. I think what you will see is what you always see around these issues. I think you will see some Democrats still adhere to a ’90s way of talking about these issues that everybody can win. Absolutely. Then, I think you will see some further to the left be more strident, or at least more zero sum in these conversations. Right. “Let’s get rid of these powers.” Yeah, we have to attack these, these have to be broken up. These should be heavily regulated. They’re greedy, they’re corrupting our democracy. All of which I think has a lot of truth to it. And then I think you will see what happens with Democratic politicians, you will see a more moderate center-left position that becomes the kind of cohesive position that says it’s not about ... you will see ... Amazon has done a lot of good for people, right? They’ll say that. This is what their message will be like. Consumer harm is the issue, right? Right. The harm in saying like, can we have a system in which these companies are able to innovate and thrive and lead the world right? As one of America’s most important and powerful sectors, while preventing some of the consequences of their worst behavior. And I think that is a very reasonable question. That to me is where the debate will ultimately lie. They also will have enormous power, Netflix taking down the episode about Saudi Arabia about journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi. Yeah. And these are some of the hardest ... They just did that. They just did it. But these are some of the hardest questions we face as a culture, right? Even dividing it into a tech conversation. You know, Netflix is going to take a lot of heat for this, but companies like Warner Bros. are deciding whether or not to include scenes in films based on what a Chinese censor would say. Well, okay. So, now Chinese censors are dictating what appears in America. Right. You know, this is a very specific example. There is a ... Martin Scorsese made a movie about Tibet. You can’t get it. Right. Because ... and that’s an old problem. We’ve been dealing with censorship around multimedia, about multinational companies and the content they create for a very long time. There’s just a new manifestation of it. And it’s more important now, in part because these companies are so much bigger, so much ... have so much control. Pervasive. They’re pervasive. So, it becomes a big conversation. But it’s a conversation we’ve had for a very long time. Right. But they are, well, you know ... Kundun. That’s the movie. Kundun. That’s right. But you know, they’ve weaponized and amplified in a way that is way beyond anything else. Well, they ... I think it’s very hard. I’ve watched you talk to Mark Zuckerberg and try desperately to get to him to lower the fucking shield that he’s built. Well, it’s hard to reprogram Data, but go ahead. It’s just, I mean ... just three inches of just solid concrete between him and you. But as you chip, chip, chip, I think the thing that is true is that they did not think enough about downside risk. No, never. Never. No. No, connecting people is good. Therefore, connecting people is good. And well, guess what? People are people. And some of them are fucking terrible. Yeah, I couldn’t get him to answer on the damages. No. You couldn’t even get him to talk about how he feels about it. No, I couldn’t. Six times. I did try to get him to fire himself. Here’s the thing. Upton Sinclair: You can’t convince somebody of something their livelihood depends on not believing. That was so high-minded, Jon. Pretty good. Upton Sinclair? Go ahead. Upton Sinclair. It’s one of my favorite lines because ... Okay. It’s a very good line. There are many conclusions Facebook can reach. The one conclusion it can’t reach is that it’s doing more harm than good. It’s not possible. Right. Right? Every technology company should have a red button somewhere in the headquarters where if they realize they’ve caused more societal harm than they expected and done more harm than good, they press the button and the company dissolves instantly. That’s it. Just a big, red button in the center of the headquarters. You need two keys to unlock it, maybe a code, maybe a two-factor. Maybe one of those Unikeys, right? Just to unlock the fucking thing. But then, push comes to shove, you know what? “Guys, it’s mostly Nazis now. Push the button.” Yeah, yeah. “It’s mostly Nazis.” “We looked, we crunched the numbers, and it’s robots and Nazis. Press the button.” It’s Nazis and ... That is a societal good! We’re getting to that. That’s a good. That is a good. You know, one of the things I’ve said is we have to like — I’ve said this recently a lot — is we have to ... they should imagine every product they make as an episode of Black Mirror. Sure. What’s the ... except not San Junipero, that one, because that’s a nice one, but all the bad ones. Absolutely. Then they shouldn’t make it if they can think of a really good episode. Right, because so far our track record is Black Mirror is just the news from four years from now. Exactly. All right. Jon, red button. I love this idea. We’re here with Jon Lovett. We’re at the headquarters of Crooked Media. And we’re loosening up. We’re loosening up. We’re starting to drink and stuff like that. We’re going to take a quick break, but stay with us. We’re going to go into wins and fails of the week when we get back with Jon Lovett. [ad] Now, back to the show. How did I read those, Jon? How did I? You did great. Did I do great? And was there anything that you’d emphasize more? QuickBooks! I think you could have brought a little more heart to it. Let’s just be honest. I don’t think you’re going to ... I don’t know if you saw Roma. I don’t think you’re going to ... I saw Roma. So I think she did a better job in her performance than you did. Oh, thank you, thank you. In yours. Thank you. But she was transcendent. She was transcendent. You were fine. Okay, thanks. I’m not up to your Roma standards? You’re not. Oh, man, that was a good movie, wasn’t it? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Why didn’t they pick up the dog poop? Just pick it up. I mean, seriously. I was like, just pick it up. It’s so funny that that’s your takeaway from the film. I literally got obsessed with it. It was making me crazy. It was crazy. It was making me crazy. And then they drove over it, I’m like, “What are you doing?” Stepped in it, drove over it. Stepped in it, drove in it. It’s a metaphor, probably. I know, exactly. Anyway, in any case, let’s move on. So we have a segment that, we’re going to talk about some wins and fails of the week. And one of them, to me, was the women in India forming the 385-mile human chain for gender equality. And then there was a fail that I thought ... men accused of sexual harassment trying to make comebacks, like Louis CK and Kevin Spacey, making some creepy attempts to get behind the microphone. What do you think? Give me some of your wins and fails. I would say ... Look, I think Nancy Pelosi becoming Speaker of the House is one of the most important wins that we will have. Oh, of course, Nancy Pelosi. Go ahead. Yes, explain. Yeah. Not just because ... So look, before this election ... I’m a partisan, but I believe that Democrats winning the House was one of the most important steps we could take as a country to protect ourselves. Right. Mm-hmm. And the cost of losing, I think, would have been cataclysmic. So we avoided a truly horrific outcome in which people felt really dispirited. And we would have learned something quite horrific, which is, there wasn’t a price for Donald Trump’s terrible behavior or Paul Ryan’s capitulation to him. So that in and of itself was valuable. But Nancy Pelosi — I think the same thing about Elizabeth Warren — Nancy Pelosi, if she were a man, she would be considered one of the great leaders in modern political history. This is correct. I like how you’re knitting this together. Yeah, and I think she would be, and I think she will be. I think increasingly she is, in part because people are pointing this out, that saying that Paul Ryan was a young gun, intellectual leader, cover of magazines, even though it was mostly a fraud. Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, grinding away for decades, retakes the speakership. And by the way, one of the most successful speakers. I mean, those first two years of the Obama administration are one of the most productive legislative periods in modern history, right? Rivaling ... Not rival ... In the pantheon of periods of time of progress with FDR and Lyndon Johnson, have a lot of things getting done in a period of great crisis. Now, she retakes that gavel at a little time of incredible importance in which we need Democrats to stick together. We need a strong leader, and we have that. I think that’s really, really important. I would say one of the big fails of this week has been this conversation around likability around Elizabeth Warren. Right. Echoing the old Hillary Clinton one. Right. And as people have pointed out, a lot of people who are currently saying Elizabeth Warren is unlikable, said that she was the likable alternative to Hillary Clinton. Isn’t it amazing how unlikable a woman becomes once she decides to go for the big prize? Right. Right. But in the same way that Nancy Pelosi isn’t given the credit she’s due, to me, it’s easy to have a conversation about how the term “likability” is sexist. And it is. It’s easy to say, “That’s wrong.” But what’s harder to talk about is what’s missing. Right. And Elizabeth Warren, I watched her announcement video, and it is excellent. It is also what she has been talking about for her entire career. Forever. Mm-hmm. Before she was in the Senate, she was a professor. She is the one who came up with this idea for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mm-hmm. That originally she was going to lead but couldn’t get confirmed for it. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. But she has been the ... She, I think, more than anyone else you could point to and say, this is the intellectual leader of democratic politics. And she doesn’t get called back. If she were a man, she would right now be the natural frontrunner, the unalloyed frontrunner in Democratic politics. She has been the intellectual leader. She is a charismatic politician. She’s incredibly smart in how she talks about issues. She has been a consistent ... She’s been ahead of the curve in terms of talking about things like corporate power, talking about what’s been happening to the middle class. It’s interesting. She’s sort of like that character on Homeland who was the president who became ... You know what I mean? She rubs people the wrong way. I don’t watch soap operas. Okay. It’s enjoyable. I like Claire Danes, and she can do anything she wants. In any case, what do you watch? I watch all kinds of things. What’s your favorite show right now? Listen, I enjoyed Homecoming. I’m watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Oh yes. It’s marvelous, isn’t it? It’s a delight. It’s delightful. It’s a delight. It’s a delight. All right, I’m going to get back to Elizabeth Warren. We had her at the Code Conference several years ago. And I have never gotten such negative feedback from men in my life. I have to tell you, it was fascinating. It was as if she went onstage and threw shit at them. It was amazing. It was sort of way out-sized, her appearance. And it was really interesting to me. What do you think that is? I’ve no idea, but it was remarkable. It was remarkable. I thought she was quite good, and very articulate about it. I don’t know if it was her shoes? I don’t know what bothered them. Something got under them and worked their last nerve with her. And it was sort of like, “Whoa,” that was fascinating. Yeah. I think she was a lady. Yeah. Also, she’s got opinions. She’s a lady with opinions. I think that’s really what it was. Unabashedly. And strong opinions. Unabashedly. And she tsk-tsked them, for sure, about wealth and power, the same thing as your corporate wealth and power, and rich people don’t like being told they’re awful, who think they’re great. Right. And they certainly don’t ... Coming from someone who’s not going to preface it by saying how sorry they are to have the opinion. Right, exactly. It was interesting. I was really like ... It was a real moment for me at the event. Yeah. I mean, look, this is ... I think a lot of the defenders of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy make this similar argument, which is, every time you say that she was uniquely ill-suited, you fail to account for the ways in which a sexist system has spent a very long time making her ill-suited in the way that you’re describing. Right. And I think that there is a lot of truth to that. You also see on the flip side, we just elected 89 women to serve in the Congress as Democrats. Right. I thought we only elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She gets a lot of attention. It was her and ... No, I know, I know that. 88 others. I know you know, I know you know. I like her squad. I like everything. Speaking of attacks. Oh man, she gets ... They are going through her yearbook and putting these things out there as if they are criticism. She danced in college. She went by a nickname. And also they were saying, oh, she didn’t go to school in the Bronx. She talks about how she took a long trip to go to a better school. Right. Right. And how she learned from her home in the Bronx to this nicer neighborhood. Right. The differences of wealth, she’s talked about it. Right. The sexist attacks on AOC are incredible. You know what’s astonishing? She’s really good at whacking them back. She is. She is. I literally have never seen someone as good at Twitter except for Trump, who I think is very good at Twitter, whether you like him or not. He’s good at it. I agree. She’s fantastic. Her chopping onions and talking about wealth was riveting. It’s also one thing, to your point, oh, I didn’t realize other women were elected. Right. Right? She is someone who has, because of her own charisma, because of conservative attacks, because of how she kind of surprised people by winning in this primary against a prominent Democrat, has been given a pretty out-sized platform. Yeah. And she’s going to use it. Right. And she’s using it really well. Yeah. And to champion things she cares about. It’s such a funny thing. It’s like, “Oh, why is AOC getting all this attention?” That’s not the question. She has it. And how is she using it? Right. She’s spending it really fucking well. Right, yeah. She’s holding people accountable on the green new deal, she’s advocating for things she cares about, she’s pushing back on right-wing attacks on her in a really sort of charming and classy way. Charming. Right, yeah. And an effective way. So, she didn’t decide to become someone who receives all this attention. A culture around her for reasons good and bad decided that. Mm-hmm. But good. Yeah. She’s using it. Yeah, she does use it really well. She’s really fascinating. It’s interesting, we’ll see how Nancy Pelosi uses the medium. She’s not real good on Twitter and stuff like that. She’s just not. Although, she did push back on the coat thing, which was a meme online. Her whole weird coat obsession, which I’m like, “It’s a coat.” And she did actually talk about it, but it was interesting how that became something. Yeah. Well, I’m glad she had that moment with Trump. Yeah. Oh no, the moment was great. Fantastic. The coat was ridiculous. The obsession of her coat she wore outside. That became the talking point. She looked good in the coat. She looked good in the coat, Jon. But really, it’s a coat. I’m not sitting here talking ... You’re the one bringing up the coat. She wore ... You can’t stop talking about it. I’m just saying. But I’m saying ... Why are you obsessed with Nancy Pelosi’s coat? Because they were discussing the coat versus what she did in there, more than what Schumer did in there. And she did the same thing. That’s my ... She’s better than Schumer. That’s right. She was quite good. And the coat became the meme, the online meme and all. So getting to that, and then I want to go to predictions, how do you look at social media and its impact in the next, going forward? Because obviously negative for the last one, and how they ... The Russian thing was a real bummer. So we crunched the numbers. Right. Bad. Bad. Bad. I don’t know. It’s a really hard question. I don’t really ... We’re out of the prediction business, but as individuals, we have to choose how we use these platforms. And I think that there’s two direct ... There’s offense and defense. On offense, I think we each choose the kind of person we are online. And I think there’s a lot of very good people who have chosen to be very ugly versions of themselves online. And I like to think that the more time we spend, the more we adapt, the more we learn, the better people will do. I think that’s wishful thinking. But I do think as individuals ... I think there’s a lot of people out there that would look back on their tweets and posts and conduct online since they started using Twitter and say ... Let’s say they took all of my tweets and made an artificially intelligent version of me. Right. Mm-hmm. Would I like that person? Right. Would I like the version of me? Do you? I like you. Listen, I think I’m the rare exception. I’m a Twitter delight. But I think for the most part we would say we are more strident, meaner, less vulnerable, less honest. We’re more narcissistic, we’re more like Trump. That’s why Trump’s good at Twitter. Right. We are ostensibly tough, but also quite weak when we’re on Twitter, right? That’s how we are. We’re extremely vulnerable to injury while projecting a kind of imperviousness. So I think that’s the offense. And there’s defense, which is how we each use it. And I take myself off now. I took myself off Twitter for this break. I occasionally went back on to search for my name. You’re very good. Just to do it, look at my mentions, because I’m human and there’s still blood in my veins. But these are tools. And I don’t think that they were developed maliciously. I think that there were truly good intentions behind Twitter. I think there are truly good intentions behind Facebook. However, these things have adapted to basically pornify our minds, right? Pornify. To reduce ideas. In the same way that McDonald’s is the porn of food, Twitter is the porn of information. Oh. It is bite-size. It gives you that little bit of feedback. Makes you feel bad, dirty. It’s that it feeds your immediate needs while over time making you feel less and less value. That is very wise thinking. Less and less whole. What about the impact on politics? How do you think politicians are looking at it for the next cycles? It’s sort of wobbly during the midterms. Yes. But it didn’t break anything. So I think there’s, again, the offensive/defensive. On offense, I would like to see more politicians just hold the phone themselves, use it the way Beto O’Rourke does. Use it the way, actually, Elizabeth Warren sometimes does, where you just kind of feel like you’re hearing from them. Use it the way AOC does. Mm-hmm. Use it the way Adam Schiff ... Adam Schiff is ... Chris Murphy and others do where you just feel like you’re hearing from them. Yeah. Honestly, Chuck Grassley at times. Mm-hmm. He’s good. He’s good. Just uses it. Chuck Grassley is good. It’s not a medium for your press releases. ",,,
245,245,02-02-16 06:15,2016,2,2,Kara Swisher,Marissa Mayer's Big Red Book: A Guide to What the Yahoo CEO Will Do Next,"In the late fall, employees across Yahoo arrived at work to find a message from CEO Marissa Mayer on their desks. Delivered to everyone simultaneously, it was in the form of a book — the “big red book,” in fact, as it would soon be called across the Silicon Valley Internet giant — that she had created to explain Yahoo to, well, Yahoos. On the opening pages of the thick tome — with a hip design, much font action, a whole lot of bold colors and a vague tone of forced fun — its goal was explicitly stated: “This book is a guide.” I was happy to finally get my hands on one. “You don’t have the book?” joked one departed staffer to me. “You really need to see the book.” I really did. And so do you. Commissioned by Mayer in a project run by her chief of staff Andrew Schulte and produced by Addison Publishing, it cost about $1 million, said sources. Books like this are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, most often made to be given to new employees as part of the onboarding process at hiring. In this case, Mayer seems to have had a different goal, in what appears to be a splashy analog attempt to boost morale. But, more than anything, it is also an insight into her thinking, displaying a mix of stubborn defiance and aggressive cheeriness strewn with the kind of you-can-do-it bromides you might find at a Tony Robbins seminar. “Our hope is that it will give everyone a shared sense of the amazing company that we work for and the incredible opportunities within our reach,” read some text. “Let’s do this.” It also stars Mayer. “We take our work seriously,” read one page, atop a photo of a smiling exec at a computer (which you can see above), “but we don’t take ourselves seriously.” In another, there is a call for Yahoo to “kick ass again.” In still another, the book shows a selfie of Mayer on her first day at the company in July of 2012, with a reprint of her confidential memo about her new job. Such confidence is much needed by Mayer today; she finds herself in a very tough situation as she announces Yahoo’s fourth-quarter earnings. Aside from the actual results, investors are looking for her and CFO Ken Goldman to give some clear statement about the plans for a spinoff of its core assets and also details about cost cuts, largely via layoffs and closures of low-performing units. Most important of all, though, will be whether there are explicit signals from Mayer about whether the company is open to a sale. On Friday, Yahoo’s board met to discuss this critical issue, as potential suitors circle the company waiting for it to publicly declare itself interested in acquisition discussions. That has been pushed by activist shareholders like Starboard Value, which has been agitating for a sale of Yahoo’s core assets. If not, it is promising a proxy fight that will mire Yahoo in a yet another protracted public tussle. While there have been no substantive talks as yet, giant telcos like Verizon and AT&T are waiting for an opening to make possible bids. “No one can be seen in a hostile takeover mode,” said one person close to the situation. “Yahoo has to really show its cards for anything to start.” That might or might not happen today. According to sources, at the Friday meeting, Mayer laid out a plan for turnaround, appealing for more time from the board to fix Yahoo. But a number of directors have become convinced that she will not be able to deliver that, especially since she has been trying to do so for several years now with a variety of largely failed efforts at Yahoo. “They are emotionally supportive of Mayer and her desire to keep at it, but some of the board just wants to get the company sold for as much money as possible,” said one person close to the situation. “They’ve had enough.” Nonetheless, those directors may face a lot of resistance from Mayer, who is well known for an intense work ethic and an equally strong drive for perfection. Numerous sources close to her said she is determined to solider on; still others said that if there is a decision to sell, she will be the one to manage the process. Mayer will probably prevail in this, given that directors are loath to directly attack a sitting CEO, especially in the clubby and insular world of Silicon Valley. “To attack Mayer, the most high-profile woman leader in tech, is not for the faint of heart,” said one source. “She has more leverage and determination than you might imagine.” That’s all reflected in the big red book. In fact, it stresses what has been her main manifesto for a while — the idea of a virtuous cycle that Mayer has repeated many times at Yahoo. Reads one page: “Great people build great products. Innovative, forward-leaning products will drive increased traffic and engagement, leading to greater advertiser interest and demand. Ultimately, this translates to revenue.” And, for Yahoo today, that depends on your definition of “ultimately.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/11587472/marissa-mayers-big-red-book-a-guide-to-what-the-yahoo-ceo-will-do-next,,Vox
246,246,28-03-19 22:44,2019,3,28,Drew Schwartz,The Wild Story of How a 'GoT' Fan Found the Last Iron Throne on Earth,"Early Thursday morning, HBO dropped the final clue in its scavenger hunt for seven Iron Thrones hidden in obscure, exotic locations around the world: an hour-long video of a giant, spiky-ass chair plunked down in the middle of what looked like a castle. This was a big one—the only Throne that had yet to be discovered—and, immediately, folks scrambled to try to track it down. Within minutes, fans figured out that it was in Fort Totten, New York, an old military compound-cum-public park in deep Queens. Anyone close enough to actually get to the thing—including yours truly—rushed to become the first to find it. But we were already too late. Melanie Joaquín saw the video of the Throne as soon as HBO published it, and the moment she laid her eyes on it, she knew where it was. She lives down the street, in an apartment building just outside the park. There was no mistaking that strange cavern, its large stone blocks, the eerie way the light drifted through its columns. The ""Throne of the Crypt,"" she knew, was inside the old Battery at Fort Totten.  She clambered out of her apartment, jumped on a bus to the park, and sprinted towards the Throne, only to find the gates to Fort Totten locked. (The producers and director who set up the Throne, tasked with unlocking the gates, had only just taken their video live. There was ""no way,"" they told me, that anyone could figure out where it was that quickly, much less actually get to it.) But Joaquín was determined.  She found a small, jagged hole in the fence, crawled through it, and ran headlong towards the old Battery, zigzagging through the park and racing down a long, dark tunnel that led to the Throne. There, waiting for her, were a pair of guards: two towering, bearded men in long fur-collared cloaks, leather boots, and 16th-century breastplates. After asking her a few staggeringly intense questions straight out of Game of Thrones itself—""What is your quest? Is it the Throne you seek?""—they guided her to it. And thus, at long last, this gem of a moment was born: Other aspirant throne-seekers would, in time, come to discover the All-Important Seat themselves, only to find that they had been beaten. Somehow, Joaquín had managed to claim her place atop it about ten minutes after HBO's video went up. ""She got here so quickly. We were in shock,"" Aramique Krauthammer, the director of the Iron Throne project, told me. ""We didn't even know where she came from. I'm still surprised, like—how is this possible?"" Her quest complete, her Throne mounted, and her crown secured, Joaquín left Fort Totten and returned to her home in Queens—only now she bore a new title, bestowed upon her by Game of Thrones itself. Allow me to introduce you, mere mortals, to Melanie Joaquín: the Queen of Queens.

247,247,19-04-18 19:16,2018,4,19,Rachael McDaniel,"Marlins P Jarlin Garcia May Not be an Ace, but He's Dealing and Easy to Root For","Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports In late August of last year, well before Jarlin Garcia began his career as a Major League starter with a record-tying ten- and one-third hitless innings, hundreds of children—elementary-schoolers, members of youth baseball teams—gathered in the Dominican municipality of Pedro Brand, in the province of Santo Domingo. In front of them were tables stacked with brand-new backpacks, each of them filled with school supplies, and standing at the tables, ready to hand out a backpack to each child, were Garcia’s father and girlfriend. When an organizer asked the gathering if they knew who Jarlin Garcia was—“Malibu,” as he is known in Pedro Brand—a huge cheer went up.  While Garcia almost certainly wasn’t a household name in North America, in Pedro Brand he was a star. Like the kids his foundation was providing school supplies for, he was born and raised there; like them, his family had often struggled to make ends meet. And now he was a pitcher in the major leagues, making enough money to provide an entire community of children with enough pencils, pens, erasers and paper to last them the school year.  Jarlin Garcia wasn’t a star in the major leagues in 2017. He was a middle reliever with a low walk rate and a low-to-mid-90s fastball that could run a little flat at times. He had progressed slowly through the minor leagues after signing with the Marlins in 2010 as a 17-year-old. It took him three seasons in rookie and low-A ball before he moved up to playing full-season baseball. He wasn’t a highly-touted prospect; he never had the kind of numbers that dazzled, high velocity or overwhelming strikeout capability. The Marlins were disappointed enough with his slow progression that they left him off their 40-man roster in 2014. And while he fared well in 2015 and 2016—going to the Futures Game, earning an All-Star selection, and slowly moving into the top ten on Marlins prospect lists—he was never highly regarded. This was someone who, if all went well for him, would probably slot in as the Marlins’ fourth starter.  Garcia’s first callup in 2016 was rather unceremonious: his manager in Double-A, where he had started the season, called him into his office and promptly told him that he was no longer wanted on the team and to “get the fuck out,” which Garcia understandably found confusing. The callup was more a move of necessity, a means of acquiring some backup for a bullpen that was stretched thin. Garcia didn’t end up pitching in Miami, only staying with the big league team for four days before getting sent back down. But he got $10,000 dollars out of the deal, and he got to say that he had made the major leagues. Both the money and the news were gifts that he could pass on to his parents back home.  Last season Garcia pitched in 68 games with the Marlins, posting a rather pedestrian 4.73 ERA with peripherals that hovered around league average—not numbers really worth noting. His debut season went essentially unnoticed by most baseball fans who aren’t devoted followers of the Marlins. But it didn’t go unnoticed back home in Pedro Brand. Garcia’s success, moderate though it may have been, had an impact that reached beyond the confines of Marlins Park, even beyond the circle of himself, his family, and his friends. All the way over in France, a Dominican ex-pat singer named J Sugar, also a native of Santo Domingo province, released a song in Garcia’s honor. Returning to Pedro Brand after the season was over along with Reds pitcher Ariel Hernandez, the song blasted from loudspeakers, floating over the enthusiastic crowd assembled to greet them.  Making it to the major leagues at all, regardless of how well you perform when you get there, is an impressive achievement, and it is in tight-knit communities where the gravity of this achievement is at its most visible. Garcia’s $40,000 signing bonus, while modest compared to some of the paydays earned by other young international amateurs and top draft picks, was life-changing money for his family. The league-minimum salary Garcia earned with the Marlins in 2017 was the kind of money that could change the lives of hundreds of families. And that is exactly how Garcia has used the platform and privilege that his career in baseball has afforded to him.  Garcia was a latecomer to baseball; for most of his childhood, his only passion was soccer. On the urging of others, who saw potential in his athleticism, he took up baseball at 15. A year later, his baby sister Genesis Mabel died in an accident in their home while he was at baseball practice. He felt responsible for the accident—perhaps if he hadn’t been out of the house, spending time on his own pursuits, he would have been able to prevent the tragedy. “I felt like my family lost its happiness that day,” he told reporters in Miami. He promised his parents that he would use baseball to support them, to turn their lives around. He was going to be something big—a major leaguer. He was going to, in his words, “give them a reason to live.”  Garcia says that he still thinks about Genesis Mabel every time he pitches. The foundation that delivers school supplies and support to children in Pedro Brand is named after her. And now he is not only a major leaguer, but has inscribed himself in major-league history. After two long-relief appearances—the first of them a masterful six shutout innings in extras against the Cubs—Garcia pitched six no-hit innings against the Mets, one of baseball’s hottest teams, in his first major-league start, before being controversially lifted after throwing only 77 pitches. On Tuesday he dominated the powerful Yankees lineup for another five innings, giving up only one hit. He has been an unexpected and welcome success for the Marlins, who could certainly use something to cheer for. Jarlin Garcia might never be an ace.

248,248,26-06-18 16:42,2018,6,26,B. David Zarley,How an Astrophysicist Used Math to Take the Math out of Darts,"On a rainy early afternoon in Devon, in South West England, Steve Moore and Paul Barham dropped in on a pub and came across a group of darts players, something in and of itself not too unusual, except for the player's make up. As twenty-somethings, they were younger than the average pub player, and evenly split between men and women. Since the game's heyday in the 1970s and 80s, when it drew TV audiences and plenty of popular attention, darts had settled back down into pub entertainment, in the common conception mainly enjoyed by drunken older men. Seeing the fun this young group of players was having, Moore and Barham were inspired to bring darts back as a social experience, a night out for friends. Moore, who had spent a decade trading futures, quit his job and began workshopping a way to streamline the darts experience and make it more approachable for the uninitiated. Moore and Barham had their work cut out for them, though. The way they saw it, the complications of scoring—so often done by hand on a chalkboard—and knowing the rules were keeping young people away from darts. Introducing tech to the equation could solve this problem, but also presented new ones: the physical barriers of having the power and precision to stick the dart for an accurate score or to trigger a pressure board, and determining exactly where on a board the dart landed would be issues.  They needed a technological framework that could solve these problems, with the most complicated being the tracking for automatic scoring. Similar systems already exist, most famously the Hawk-Eye, which tracks balls for tennis and soccer, among other sports. But tracking a ball was one thing; tracking darts was considered quite another. “The working assumption in the industry, or everywhere, was it just wasn't possible,” Moore said via phone.  Computer vision systems utilize cameras and complex mathematical models to pinpoint where in three dimensional space an object is located. A ball is a fairly simple object, the same shape from the viewpoint of any camera looking at it; a goal line or baseline is a fairly simple demarcation. Darts, on the other hand, come at the board from a dizzying array of angles, any of which would cause the dart to appear as a different shape to a camera; furthering the confusion, players, especially elite ones, often cluster their shots together, practically on top of one another.  “You have to do a lot of forecasting tools,” Moore said. “It's just so over-engineered; the mathematics behind it is pointlessly silly, but it's needed.” Moore put out a challenge to universities and PhD programs across the U.K. and Europe: under the guise of archery, design a forecasting system that could track missiles with the speed and accuracy an automatically scored dart board would need. Dr. Jason Dale, an astrophysicist with a computer vision PhD, answered the call. Dale had previously worked on projects for NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a division of the United States Department of Defense that designs experimental technologies, and his aerospace background made him uniquely suited to working out how to track arrows or darts. “I guess I worked in a similar industry in that it involved pointy things flying through the air,” Dale said by phone. The final, refined product, made with the help of countless product testing, relies on three high performance cameras mounted above a classic Unicorn dart board—their desire to keep the iconic board unchanged ruled out a more accurate pressure plate scoring system common in bars in the U.S.—operating Dale's mathematical model.  The overlapping flight paths are the most difficult aspect to model. Darts in a specific shade of blue—they've chosen something close to ultramarine; any color would have worked—are tracked by the three cameras when thrown. The math relies on brute force to track the darts; it rapidly throws three virtual darts through millions of different orientations and angles until it finds what matches where the dart landed on the board. “It makes billions of operations,” Dale said. “Essentially, millions of different dart hits are attempted until it finds which one fits all three crossing darts on the image.”  A simple touchscreen interface and video screens add the bells and whistles, and the whole thing—dubbed an “oche”—are the key element of Flight Club, the “social darts” bar and restaurant chain making its first inroads into the U.S. in Chicago. Players input names and photos, and the oche takes them through a variety of unique, Flight Club-specific darts games. Since its first jury-rigged setup in Moore's shed, when the oche system took 16 seconds to compute an incorrect result, Dale says they can now accurately track three darts with 99.6 percent accuracy, computing where they land on the board within 200 microns of accuracy and in less than half a second. The system seems simple and seamless while it is used, with no delay or obvious misses when VICE Sports tossed a few in Chicago. Adam Breeden, founder of ping pong bar AceBounce and the U.S. operator of Flight Club, considers the technology the most essential part of the game. “You're not playing darts,” Breeden said when reached by phone. “You're using a dart board, but you're actually playing something totally different.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbky5n/how-an-astrophysicist-used-math-to-take-the-math-out-of-darts,Sports,Vice
249,249,27-06-19 00:00,2019,6,27,James Davey,UPDATE 3-Britain's Kingfisher turns to Carrefour veteran to revive fortunes,"* Thierry Garnier named new Kingfisher CEO  * Current CEO Véronique Laury to leave by end of Sept  * Garnier in senior roles for 20 yrs at Carrefour, now Asia CEO  * Shares rise as much as 3.4% (Adds detail, analyst comment, updates shares)  By James Davey  LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - British home improvement retailer Kingfisher has named Thierry Garnier as its new chief executive, hoping the Carrefour veteran can revive its fortunes, particularly its struggling French operation.  Kingfisher, whose main businesses are B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and elsewhere, is in the fourth year of what was originally a five-year programme to boost earnings.  However, after profits fell in the 2018-19 year, the group said in March it was abandoning its 500-million-pound ($635 million) targeted profit improvement and would part company with Véronique Laury, CEO since 2014.  Last month the group missed forecasts for sales growth in its first quarter, with sales continuing to fall in France - a market that contributed 37% of group revenue in 2018-19.  Shares in Kingfisher, the world’s fourth largest home improvement retailer after Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Adeo, rose as much as 3.4% on Thursday, reducing year-on-year losses to about 29%.  French national Garnier, 53, who has spent 20 years in senior roles at Carrefour and is currently head of its Asia operations, will join Kingfisher in the autumn, though the date is yet to be finalised. Laury will step down as CEO by the end of September.  “Given the extremely challenged French execution of recent years, the appointment of a French CEO at Kingfisher’s helm was always a more likely outcome,” said analysts at Jefferies.  “We presume Garnier will move rapidly to assess what went wrong (in France) and take corrective action.”  Garnier is a member of the Carrefour group executive committee and has been CEO of Carrefour Asia since 2012, responsible for over 350 stores in China and Taiwan, with 55,000 employees, and gross sales of over 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion).  On Monday Carrefour agreed to sell 80% of its Chinese operations to electronics retailer Suning.com for 620 million euros.  Garnier also previously oversaw Carrefour France’s supermarkets and its international operations. In the 1990s he was a civil servant and an advisor at one point to Michel Barnier - currently the European Union’s Brexit negotiator.  “Throughout his career he has led significant businesses through complex change programmes while operating in competitive and rapidly changing retail environments,” said Kingfisher chairman Andy Cosslett.  Analysts highlighted Garnier’s extensive experience in optimising international scale in buying - a key tenet of Kingfisher’s strategy.  Laury’s plan for the group, costing 800 million pounds over five years, involved unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings.  Kingfisher said in March that it had reviewed Laury’s strategy and fully supported it, suggesting Garnier’s appointment will mean a review and development of the existing strategy’s execution rather than an overhaul.  However, some analysts have argued the group should be broken up.  While Kingfisher has struggled in France, progress in Britain has been hard won in a market where Australia’s Wesfarmers came unstuck after a disastrous investment in the Homebase chain.  Kingfisher said Garnier’s remuneration package would be announced when his start date is finalised.  $1 = 0.7877 pounds
$1 = 0.8798 euros

250,250,11-04-19 00:00,2019,4,11,Tess Owen,What we know about the man who allegedly burned three black churches in Louisiana,"Louisiana officials are trying to learn what motivated a sheriff’s deputy’s son who allegedly burned three black churches in the state recently. At a press conference Thursday, officials said 21-year-old Holden Matthews, whose father is a sheriff’s deputy in St. Landry Parish, is facing arson charges for allegedly burning the churches in neighboring towns over a 10-day period. St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist church, also in Opelousas, all have predominantly black congregations. Matthews would have carried out further attacks if he hadn’t been arrested, the officials added.  In the search for a motive, the FBI will particularly be looking for evidence to support or dismiss the possibility of hate crime charges — namely, did Matthews, who is white, specifically target black churches due to racial bias? At the press conference, Louisiana Fire Marshal H. “Butch” Browning said investigators were looking into Matthews’ involvement in “a type of music called black metal and its associations with church burnings that has been documented in books and movies.”  Keith Boutte, a singer, songwriter and artist from the St. Landry area, told VICE News that Matthews contacted him about six months ago, wanting to jam. “He liked my vocals and my music. I told him that black metal isn’t what I do. I like blues and aggressive music, but I don’t like black metal or death metal,” said Boutte, 39. Still, Boutte and Matthews stayed in touch and continued to talk about music.

I told him that black metal isn’t what I do. I like blues and aggressive music, but I don’t like black metal or death metal,” said Boutte, 39. Still, Boutte and Matthews stayed in touch and continued to talk about music.  Boutte says he lives just down the road from where one of the churches burned, and was initially shocked to learn that Matthews was the alleged arsonist.  “He just doesn’t seem like someone who would do a heinous act like that. Just a normal gung-ho kid goin’ around talking about music,” said Boutte. “But I hate to say it: It almost doesn’t surprise me, because he’s big into black metal.” But experts in metal music say that a person’s interest in black metal music alone doesn’t make them more or less likely to commit arson against churches.  The metal music genre has lots of subgenres and nuances. There are strains of metal that cater to the far-right neo-Nazi crowd. There’s also a robust anti-fascist metal scene. In the early 1990s, the black metal scene was linked to dozens of church burnings in Norway, which was the subject of the 2018 film “Lords of Chaos.” “This scene was highly influential in developing black metal worldwide,” said Keith Kahn-Harris, author of ‘Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge.” “However, far-right activity is by no means the norm in black metal, and it would be wrong to say it was intrinsic to it.”  There are subgenres even within black metal. Kahn-Harris said knowing which scene Matthews was buying into is important in this context. “It’s vital that we understand the role that black metal played in Holden Matthews' life in order to judge how far it inspired his actions,” said Kahn-Harris. “In particular, I'd like to know what sort of black metal he listened to. Did he listen to NSBM specifically?” (NSBM is National Socialist Black Metal, a subgenre of black metal that promotes Nazism.) According to the Daily Beast, Matthews commented on two memes about Varg Vikernes, a black metal musician who did time in prison for burning churches in Norway in the 1990s. Vikernes, who has been described as a sympathizer of Anders Breivik, the Norweigan neo-Nazi who murdered 77 people, was arrested in 2013 by French authorities on suspicion of plotting “a large terror attack.” He was found guilty the following year of inciting racial hatred for publishing racist screeds online attacking Muslims and Jews.  In an interview with BuzzFeed, an associate of Matthews from the metal scene described him as someone who was impressionable and trying to fit in. Nygyl Brynn, who told BuzzFeed he’d known Matthews since 2014, said most people in the black metal scene were offended for how “Lords of Chaos” portrayed their culture by focusing on the church burnings. “But Holden liked it,” Brynn said.  A Facebook page linked to Matthews, who describes himself as a singer and songwriter for a band called the “Vodka Vultures,” tells us little more about his specific inclinations, either politically or musically speaking. The artists and pages that he’d “liked’ are mostly local bands or musicians.  It’s also not clear what Matthews did for a living beyond his aspirations to make it as a musician. Public records show that he was a registered Democrat.  As for why Matthews allegedly singled out those churches, Boutte says churches are a dime a dozen in that part of Louisiana. “The community down here is hardcore Catholic. It’s the Bible Belt of Louisiana,” said Boutte. “Every corner, you see a church.” Cover: Eric J.

251,251,12-04-16 12:00,2016,4,12,Kaleigh Rogers,Should E-Cigarettes Even Be Allowed on Planes?,"Vapers haven't been able to cloud chase in the middle of a cross-country flight for years, thanks to airline policies banning vaping on board. But if a new senate amendment is approved, vapers won't even be able to bring their devices onboard a plane in the first place. S.A. 3547 is an amendment to an amendment (isn't bureaucracy fun?) on the Federal Aviation Authority's reauthorization bill, which is currently being discussed by the US Senate. It includes a short provision that would ban vaping devices from being brought on board, even in carry-on luggage. Vaping devices were banned from being packed in checked luggage or charged onboard by the Department of Transportation last October, but this would extend the law to prevent vapers from flying with their gear at all. This has many in the vaping community alarmed. Unlike cigarettes (which are allowed in carry-on luggage), or even vape juice, one can't easily or cheaply pick up a new custom mod after touching down. Vaping devices are personal, reusable, and can be expensive—in some ways, they're often more like a cell phone than a pack of Marlboros.  ""I travelled [to Dallas] with five box mods, some tanks, some juice, and a box full of batteries,"" vape reviewer Jess Hawkins said in a vlog about the amendment. ""In order for me to be down here for two weeks, continue vaping, and not go back to smoking, I've got to carry that stuff with me."" But legislators have safety concerns about e-cigarettes on planes due to a growing number of reports of the devices exploding and catching fire. As of January 2016, there have been 11 recorded incidents of e-cigarettes either smoking, catching fire, or exploding on planes, according to a report by the FAA. That's out of a total of 171 incidents of any battery-powered objects catching fire or exploding on planes since 1991, and many of those incidents involved cell phones and laptops. E-cigarettes are also relatively new and not as ubiquitous as cell phones, so 11 cases isn't an insignificant number. But even the US Fire Administration notes that vaping devices catching fire or exploding is rare, usually not serious, and most often occurs when the device is charging or in use, not sitting in a bag. If other common electronics with lithium batteries—like laptops and cell phones—can catch fire occasionally, too, why single out e-cigarettes? Earlier this year, despite some theatrical arguments against it, Congress voted to make it illegal to vape on planes—catching up to the existing airline restrictions—so there's definitely an appetite to regulate these devices in the air. It's also worth noting that Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who introduced the amendment, hasn't exactly been pro-vape in the past. He was a big supporter of the recently passed airplane bans, has pushed for banning flavored e-liquids, and urged the FDA to hurry up with finalizing its e-cig regulations. Motherboard reached out to Sen. Blumenthal but he was not available for comment before deadline. It's still very early days for this amendment, which has yet to be formally introduced, and vaping advocacy groups have launched campaigns against it. But if it gains traction, it would mean the end of vapors being able to easily travel with their goods. ""They've already prohibited these devices from being used, being charged, and being stored in checked bags, banning from possession goes too far,"" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association. ""Any senator who votes for this is essentially declaring war on their ex-smoker constituents.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz7zkw/should-e-cigarettes-even-be-allowed-on-planes-vaping-congress-politics-law-air-travel-carry-on,Tech by VICE,Vice

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described that during ISIS' retreat from Manbij to Jarabulus, a city on the Turkish border, the militants took ahold of their hostages in hopes to slow the SDF's advances on what was once a major ISIS-held city. In order to accomplish taking such a large number of hostages, a report by the AFP suggests that ISIS took the residents' cars and forced civilians into them as they made their retreat — preventing the SDF from targeting them. After SDF forces began their offensive on May 31, they've so far liberated about 90% of Manbij and even rescued 2,500 captive civilians; however, dozens of ISIS fighters still remain and have put up a noticeable resistance. This wouldn't be the first time that ISIS has taken hostages during a retreat. More than 400 civilians, including women and children, were taken from eastern Syria in January. Although 270 of them were eventually released, the jihadists had also used hostages for booby-trapped cars and suicide bombings. Manbij has been a critical Syrian city for ISIS' supply routes to their main stronghold in Raqqa. After being assaulted not only by the SDF but US-led coalition forces, the militants here have been making numerous blunders during their operations — including having 83 oil tankers out in the open for an easy airstrike.

US: a surprise Supreme Court decision will let some federal prisoners out early,"Some federal prisoners might qualify for shorter sentences, or even release, after a Supreme Court ruling today that held that a decision last year on a major criminal law case would be applied retroactively. On a vote of 7-1 in Welch v. United States, the Court ruled that its decision in Johnson v. United States, a case about federal sentencing law, would apply even to prisoners who have already been sentenced and whose cases are closed. Only Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. Johnson v. United States dealt with the Armed Career Criminal Act, a federal version of ""three strikes and you're out"" laws that added five years to the sentences for criminals convicted of at least four ""violent felonies"" or serious drug crimes. But ""violent felonies"" isn't a legal term, and the catchall definition of federal law — ""conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another"" — was so vague that it was unconstitutional, the Court ruled last year. Before the Court heard the case, SCOTUSblog's Rory Little laid out in plain language what a decision to apply Johnson retroactively would mean: if Johnson applies retroactively, any defendant who has been sentenced to a lengthy federal term as a ""fourtime loser,"" with one of his three prior convictions found to be ""violent"" only under the residual clause, could demand resentencing and a substantial reduction of his sentence – or even immediate release. The Court decided very quickly — it heard arguments March 30 and issued the opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, on a Monday, an unusual step. It's not yet clear how many prisoners will be affected. As Vox's Dara Lind wrote last year, about 7,000 federal prisoners are serving time under the Armed Career Criminal Act, but it's not clear how many were sentenced using the definition of ""violent felony"" the Court has found to be too vague.",https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11450368/supreme-court-sentencing-welch-us,,Vox
258,258,06-09-16 13:50,2016,9,6,Jeff Stein,"The FBI report on Hillary Clinton’s private email server, explained","FBI Director James Comey stunned reporters back in July when he laced into Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. ""There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Comey said of Clinton and her team. The FBI cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with its investigation, saying it couldn’t prove that she had knowingly exchanged classified information on her private email server. But on Friday, the FBI took the unusual step of releasing a 58-page report with the findings from its work on the case, including 11 pages of notes from its interview with Clinton herself. I read the report, and it goes a long way toward explaining why Comey considered Clinton’s behavior ""extremely careless"" — even if it also suggests there was likely little malice behind her worst missteps. The biggest concern the FBI report keeps coming back to is whether someone or some foreign government was able to hack into, and steal, the emails Clinton was sending with other members of the state department. While secretary of state, Clinton exclusively used a private email account hosted on a private email server installed at her family’s home in Westchester, New York. And at least 100 of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the state department have turned out to have contained classified information at the time they were sent or received; seven of her email chains had the ""top secret"" designation. Those two facts — that Clinton’s email server was unsecured and that she, knowingly or not, exchanged classified information — have long raised the possibility that Clinton gave hackers an opening to go after state secrets. The FBI report makes clear that many at least tried. The bureau produced several pages of evidence detailing its attempts to figure out if Clinton’s server was ultimately breached. They note a slew of reasons to be concerned: To be clear: The FBI expressly says that there’s no proof that any attempted hack on Hillary Clinton’s personal email account was successful. But the report also makes very clear that they found evidence that someone was trying to break into what was almost certainly a weaker defense than the government systems Clinton would have been using under the normal channels. But the absence of evidence doesn’t mean evidence of absence. As Vox’s Lee has noted, the FBI has no way of really knowing whether Clinton’s servers were compromised in any way. The hackers could simply steal the classified information and disappear without a trace. But potentially even worse, at least from Comey’s perspective, is that there’s no way of testing whether much of the equipment used by Clinton actually was hacked. That’s because the FBI doesn’t have it. This was one of the more surprising revelations in the FBI report, and the one most discussed in the subsequent coverage: A large number of devices used by Clinton at State have since gone missing and are beyond the FBI’s ability to recover. The digital body count of missing Clinton electronic devices includes: 11 of the 13 BlackBerrys she used as secretary of state (the other two were destroyed by hammer); three of the five iPads she used to send and receive emails (the two the FBI did recover showed no evidence of having been hacked); and one thumb drive and one laptop with the archives of all of Clinton’s email correspondence. These last two — the thumb drive and the laptop — were somehow lost in the mail by the private contractor responsible for maintaining Clinton’s private email account. (This was after they were also previously briefly lost for a period of time by a Clinton staffer during an office move.) Nobody seems to know where the missing phones are, either. (Or exactly why Clinton ran through phones so quickly — she seems to have repeatedly upgraded and downgraded her devices). Her aides seem to have been responsible for finding a new BlackBerry for Clinton when they malfunctioned, but what happened to the old ones isn’t clear. Most of us have probably discarded an old smartphone or two over the years, but most of us aren’t cabinet officials dealing with sensitive information and targeted by foreign intelligence agencies. So there may be quite a few phones and laptops floating about with classified information somewhere in them. That itself may be an ongoing security risk, but it also prevents the FBI from testing these devices to see if they were ever successfully hacked.In a statement, the Clinton campaign noted that the FBI had decided not to press charges. ""While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with the case,"" said campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon. Beyond questions of compliance with government rules and security best practices, there is the question of whether Clinton’s email security lapses actually represented a substantive risk to national security. Without knowing the contents of the emails, there’s no way to know if their possible disclosure to hackers was genuinely damaging. The US government is widely believed to routinely overclassify information (Congress even passed a Reducing Over-Classification Act in 2010 to try to get agencies to stop doing this) marking fairly trivial discussions ""classified"" or ""confidential"" when they don’t need to be. State Department personnel may have been willing to discuss ""classified"" matters with Clinton over email because in their judgment the information was not genuinely sensitive. Moreover, many of the emails were classified retroactively, so maybe Clinton really can’t be faulted for exchanging them in the first place. The difficulty is we simply don’t know what information was contained in the emails in question. There are two levels to this. One is simply that, by definition, the classified portions of the emails turned over to the FBI are classified. The FBI itself knows what these emails say, but the public does not. Wall Street Journal reporting indicates that some of them are related to drone strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the FBI report confirms that Clinton was asked about emails related to drone strikes. A separate issue is that the FBI does not have every email that was on Clinton’s server. Her server and her email account were used for both work and personal business. She instructed her legal team to hand all ""work related"" emails to the State Department, and then in December 2014, Cheryl Mills, one of her top aides, told the contractor holding Clinton’s email archive to delete the personal emails that had not been turned over. Many of those emails are now gone, and the FBI has been unable to recover them. If you trust Hillary Clinton, the FBI agents who investigated her, and the lawyers who were directed to segregate the work-related from personal emails, then there’s no clear evidence here of any serious harm. But if you don’t trust Clinton (and polls show most people don’t) — and especially if you think the FBI or Williams & Connolly are covering for her — then there’s certainly room to keep doubting. (It's also worth noting that the state department's servers may not have been that much better protected — in 2006, hackers stole sensitive US information from the state department's unclassified server.) Conservatives have been quick to jump on this controversy as revealing the breadth of her ""dishonesty and deception,"" alleging that she lied to shield her decisions from scrutiny. Liberals have defended Clinton’s machinations as those of a shrewd political operator, rationally fearful of a Republican witch-hunt, simply stretching the bounds of open records law. But the truth is less conspiratorial. The evidence in the report suggests that Clinton’s undoing here was that she simply never took the time to really understand the details of email server management or how they related to the state department’s classification system. One section of the FBI report makes clear that the whole email enterprise was more or less an afterthought to her: (Clinton) stated there was a process in place at State before her tenure (for handling emails), and she relied on career foreign service professions to appropriately mark and handle classified information … Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an unclassified system. She relied on state officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address. In her FBI interview, Clinton again and again suggests that she didn’t take questions around classification and email security seriously, saying she didn’t remember things like the proper use of a Special Access Program security briefing, which state department employees had their Gmail accounts hacked, or even whether the ""c"" meant ""confidential"" in departmental exchanges. (The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake runs down some of the more than 30 times in her FBI interview Clinton said she didn’t know something.) And that fits the impression left by Comey himself in July, in which he surprised congressional lawmakers by appearing to suggest he didn’t think Clinton had set up the alternative email account to circumvent open records laws, according to Vox’s Andrew Prokop. The Clinton stereotype makes her out to be a conniving politician who will do what it takes to obtain power. So when the FBI investigates her for email mismanagement, it’s our natural inclination to fit those new facts to the preexisting stereotype. But the FBI’s email investigation points to just the opposite conclusion. It suggests someone who didn’t recognize or understand the dangers of a ""homebrew"" server, and who didn’t sweat the details of what happened to her discarded BlackBerrys. (Understandably so! Clinton was tasked with running US foreign policy at the time and presumably also had other things to worry about.) Clinton, in other words, wasn’t a technocratic and savvy manipulator of State Department email protocol who gamed the system for her own good. She barely understood what the protocol was.",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12774948/fbi-hillary-clinton-report,,Vox
259,259,21-09-18 00:00,2018,9,21,,Political price of no-deal Brexit would be high: Sturgeon,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives would pay a high political price for a no-deal Brexit in Scotland, which voted to keep its EU membership, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.  The Conservatives are the second-largest party in Scotland’s devolved government behind Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists (SNP) and also send the second-biggest number of lawmakers to the British parliament, with 13 of the country’s 55 seats at Westminster.  May has challenged the European Union to come up with a better solution than her so-called Chequers proposal for Brexit, rejected out of hand at a European summit on Thursday.  “If (May’s) tactic now is to double down on the Chequers dead duck, and then blame EU for a no deal, she will do huge damage to all those she is supposed to serve,” Sturgeon said in a statement on Friday.  “(Blaming the EU for a no-deal) would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit,” she added.  Scotland, one of the United Kingdom’s four nations, voted by a large margin to remain in the EU in a June 2016 referendum although the UK as a whole voted to leave.  Sturgeon, who supports independence for Scotland, accuses May’s party of consistently ignoring Scots’ wishes in the Brexit  negotiations and has called on her to keep Britain in the EU single market.

262,262,28-08-17 19:10,2017,8,28,Manisha Krishnan,Inside the Oceanside Commune Where Young People Live In 'Anarchy'  ,"For inhabitants of Poole's Land, even taking a shit is an act of rebellion. The sprawling 17-acre property, located in a rainforest in the oceanside British Columbia community of Tofino, hasn't been connected to the area's septic system since it opened in 1988. Instead, the residents, of which there are roughly 100 right now, use composting toilets.  That means they relieve themselves in toilets filled with cedar, which Poole's Land manager, Michael Goodliffe, 47, claims disinfects everything. When I ask what they do after the toilets on site fill up, he says, ""Shovel."" ""Doesn't that gross you out?"" I persist, to which he replies ""what grosses me out is putting raw untreated sewage into (the ocean)""—a shot at the rest of the townsfolk. He goes on to tell an anecdote about how one of the campers added a bit of ceremony to the cleaning of the toilets, wearing a suit complete with a tie and top hat as he performed the grim task. Suffice to say, the people of Poole's Land buck convention. In fact, it feels as if they've tossed convention, capitalist ideals, and to a certain degree, hygiene, into one of their huge nightly bonfires, and they haven't looked back. By now you'll be wondering: What exactly is Poole's Land? I first heard about it when I came across a headline: ""This commune in BC lets you live for free and pays you in drugs."" The piece depicts Poole's Land as an eco-village where people can live in exchange for performing onsite labor, or get paid in magic mushrooms.  I spent a day there last week trying to find out if that was truly the case, and in short, the answer depends on who you ask. Everyone I meet says residents no longer get paid in shrooms, which apparently disappoints a lot of newcomers who read the same article I did. At $10 a night, Poole's Land is a cheap place for travelers stopping through Tofino on a surf trip and for young people working a summer job in town. But there are others who've been living there for years and who truly view it as their home and the residents as family. It also tends to draw people who are outcasts, poor, or mentally ill.  Folks like Goodliffe, who has lived at Poole's on and off for decades, resent the characterization of their secret slice of paradise as a ""drug commune,"" though there's no doubt drugs are a part of the culture. Almost everyone is rolling a joint or hitting the bong. While I'm there, I take a tour through a small ganja garden and witness people do mushrooms and trip on LSD and MDMA. One French woman tells me she's about to try fire tossing—which seems risky at the best of times—and then casually mentions that she's just dropped acid. The vibes are reminiscent of a party hostel that just so happens to be situated in the woods. But there's more to it than that; it feels like people are here to free themselves of the monotony of living to work, settling down, having a full-time job, and buying property. As one of the residents, a 24-year-old former sous chef named Cheyanne, puts it: ""It's not crazy hippies on drugs; it's a bunch of fucked-up people helping each other."" They want to indulge, she adds, ""not in drugs, but in life.""  Purchased in 1988 by Michael Poole, a bonafide hallucinogenic-loving hippie, for the absurdly low sum of $50,000, the thickly forested land itself is stunning. There are cedars, Douglas fir trees, ponds, and bears as well as cougars, I'm told, with dirt paths and boardwalks weaving in between. Wandering around, trying not to trip over roots or loose wood planks, I see makeshift shelters, including tents, trailers, tiny wood shacks, tree houses, and converted vans. The residents also share a kitchen, using veggies from their own garden to cook nightly meals. The kitchen is pretty much the only spot that has a decent cellphone signal. Despite the beautiful surroundings, I can't help but notice the campgrounds aren't exactly pristine. There's a fair amount of trash, recyclables, and cigarette butts lying around, and everyone smells… rather natural. I come across a towel hanging on a clothesline that's covered in brown stains. I'm told there's one hot shower that not many people use. ""I haven't showered in two years—I just use the ocean,"" says Hubert, a chiseled 23-year-old surfer with white-blond dreads. Hubert moved to Poole's seven months ago but has been living out of a van for three years. He sleeps in a little wood cabin with his black lab and is currently in the process of making surfboards for sale, so Poole's is helping him set up a workshop.  Without batting an eye, Hubert, Goodliffe, and a couple other men point to the brown pond beside us and tell me they drink from it and bathe in it. (The color is due to the dead cedars on the bottom.)  ""Apart from the look and the layer of slime, it's right as rain,"" says Josh Pawton, 23, a New Zealander who is relatively new to Poole's, while someone else chimes in, ""We haven't had diarrhea yet.""  Matt, a brunette 20-something with an addictively cheerful personality, describes Poole's as ""anarchy,"" which he seems to think might be it's best and worst quality.  ""It's a fine line between everything is allowed and (having) some sense of direction.""  He says it's a judgment-free zone, and then, as if to prove his point, he recalls encounters with a woman who thinks she can control the weather with her mind; a person who believes they have intergalactic space clearance; and a man who claimed to be working for Anonymous and left Matt his passport and a bunch of expensive camera equipment.  But as much as it sounds like a hippie fantasy, Poole's has a less-than-flattering reputation in town.  A few years ago, it was reportedly home to viral video star Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker, a.k.a. Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, who was later charged with murder.  ""A lot of times if you tell a prospective employer you live in Poole's Land, you're done. Because of hygiene, if you're a server and they know you live in a tent in a forest…"" says a 25-year-old named Adam. Several people repeat an apparently well-known mantra that goes something like, ""If your bike goes missing, you'll find it at Poole's Land.""  As for the drugs, Goodliffe, who grew up on an off-the-grid commune in Manitoba, Canada, repeatedly tells me that Poole's is not a stomping grounds for dealers. When I ask why he's so fixated on changing that reputation, he says, ""It undermines the integrity of the place. The mandate of the place is to keep people safe, not to sell drugs."" (There are naloxone kits on site.)  Goodliffe says he's kicked people out for bringing coke onto the premises and even for giving hallucinogens to people with mental illness, which he feels is dangerous.  ""I grew up with a father who did LSD all his life. I've seen the long-term effects. It causes mental illness.""  He thinks Poole's is a natural choice for people with mental illness because they're accepted, and they can afford it.  ""They have no money, and they're looking for community,"" he says, noting one of the residents suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.  I ask Goodliffe if it's strange for him to live among a bunch of 20-somethings, but he seems to think he'd be more out of place in a traditional setting. ""People my age all want to live in a house and work a nine-to-five job. They're not really my people,"" he says. ""When you have people isolated in cities and towns in little boxes, they feel isolated.""  Of course, not everyone is at Poole's Land for the long haul. Thomas Jackson, a baby-faced 23-year-old from London, Ontario, has only been here three weeks, and he's already planning an exit. (He admits the toilets are too rough for his taste.) Naturally, Jackson says the thing that really makes Poole's Land special is the fact that he can't get good cell service. ""It puts you back ten years,"" he says. ""People talk to each other."" As he leads me through the forest to a treehouse called the ""Pyramid,"" he pauses and says, ""The thing with the off the grid, or hippie life, is at the end of the day, you're still going to get old. People still have stresses in their life. You're not going to escape.""  Maybe not, but Poole's Land seems like the place to try.

But it seems time has healed this particular wound: Carpenter will be an executive producer on a new ""Halloween"" movie, which will be financed by Miramax and Blumhouse Productions, according to an announcement released on Monday. This is the first time Carpenter has been directly involved in a ""Halloween"" movie since 1982's ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" (for which he was a producer). ""'Halloween' needs to return to its traditions,"" Carpenter said in a statement. ""I feel like the movies have gotten away from that... Michael is not just a human being; he's a force of nature, like the wind. That's what makes him so scary."" This new ""Halloween,"" which is currently in preproduction, will be the 10th sequel in the classic horror franchise that follows a psychotic masked killer named Michael Myers. The first ""Halloween,"" which opened in 1978 and starred a then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis as the babysitter Myers is stalking and Donald Pleasence as the psychiatrist determined to kill Myers, was an instant hit. The movie was made for just $325,000 and it earned $47 million worldwide. The scares in the movie were heightened by the film's memorable score, which Carpenter also created. The sequels in the decades since have seen hits and misses. But Blumhouse head Jason Blum, who's been behind recent low-budget horror hits like the ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious"" franchises, believes getting Carpenter back into the mix is what the Myers series has been missing. ""'Halloween' is one of those milestone films that inspired everyone at our company to get into the world of scary movies,"" Blum said in a statement, ""and we are so excited that Miramax brought us together. We cannot wait to find and collaborate with the right filmmaker to give 'Halloween' fans the movie they deserve.""

Here are the basics:   Russia said it was cutting the “deconfliction line,” a key communication channel between Moscow and Washington used to prevent mixed messages and avoid military collisions between the two powers. The U.S.-led coalition’s actions were further complicated by Iran, which over the weekend launched strikes on ISIS targets in Eastern Syria — Iran’s first missile strikes into the country. “As the Islamic State’s territory in Syria shrinks, the U.S. is increasingly being put in direct contact with Syria and its allies,” said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal. “The U.S. must decide if it wants to continue to actively support its proxies in the Syria civil war. If it does, it will be in direct conflict with Russia, Iran, Syria, and hostile Shia militias.” The U.S. has maintained its broadening military involvement in Syria is part of the global fight against ISIS, and has avoided engaging directly with the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad and the larger civil war playing out in Syria.   The last time Russia threatened to cut off the deconfliction line was in April, when the U.S. launched missiles at a Syrian airbase in what ultimately amounted to a warning shot in retaliation for Assad’s continued use of chemical weapons.

There's only one problem: Using a dead man's sperm for insemination is illegal in France. Marina Gonzalez' husband, Nicola Turri, was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago. Concerned that his treatment might impact his fertility, Turri had his sperm frozen in 2013. The ""straws"" containing the sperm are currently held at a research center and sperm bank in Paris, where the couple was living at the time. After initially going into remission, Turri was diagnosed with leukemia in 2015. That year, he scheduled an appointment with an attorney to officially give consent for his wife to undergo Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment, using his frozen sperm. Gonzalez's attorney, David Simhon, told French news agency AFP that Turri died ""one hour before he was due to meet"" his attorney on July 9, 2015. Gonzalez is now asking France's Council of State to hand over her late husband's frozen sperm so that she can be inseminated in Spain. In an interview with France 2 in April, the young woman said she wanted ""to be the mother of my life partner's child,"" and that she hoped the court would allow her to carry out her late husband's wish. The Council of State is Gonzalez's last hope of a legal resolution in France, after an administrative court denied her original request.

On Friday, public rapporteur Aurélie Bretonneau said that she did not oppose the transfer of the sperm to Spain in light of the ""exceptional"" situation, AFP reported. Related: Lawsuit Alleges Sperm Bank's Genius Donor Was Actually a Schizophrenic Ex-Con Véronique Fournier, director of the Clinical Ethics Center (Centre d'Éthique Clinique), in Paris, told VICE News that she wasn't sure whether Bretonneau's statement implied a future change to the law, or whether it marked a desire ""to respect [the wishes] of European nationals living in the country."" According to French daily Le Figaro, Simhon argued that the couple's decision to become parents had been ""clearly defined"" and was ""already in process."" Turri also left a will that authorized his wife to use his sperm even in the event of his death. During the hearing on Friday, the court was told that the couple already one failed insemination attempt prior to Turri's death. A provision of France's Public Health Code, which was introduced in 1994 and revised in 2004, says individuals wishing to undergo ART procedures ""must be living, old enough to procreate, and have previously consented to transferring embryos for insemination."" According to the code, ""the death of one of the individuals in the couple"" constitutes ""an obstacle"" to insemination. In a report published in 2009, the Council of State ruled to ban the postmortem transfer of embryos, arguing that children born from such a procedure ""might be exposed to factors, which could contribute to imbalance or psychological hardship associated with the position of a child born out of grief."" The council also said there was ""broad consensus"" for the ban. But in 2011, France's National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE) said the majority of its members believed the procedure ""should be authorized"" under certain circumstances, including a minimum period of reflection for the man prior to his death. The council, however, said it would be unwise to undo the ban on postmortem insemination, saying that, for the child, ""the symbolic burden of having been conceived with sperm from a man that was already deceased could compound the difficulties he/she will experience from being born without a father."" The council also said that it is hard to verify whether or not the father had indeed agreed to the procedure.

She said that while France enforces strict biothethical guidelines within its borders, it remains flexible when it comes to ""reproductive tourism."" ""The state wants such and such law to be in place in the territory but does not forbid nationals to do whatever they want abroad,"" she said. ""The newborn will have no links to France,"" Simhon told Le Figaro. ""We are not asking for a reform of the French law. In light of that, how can they oppose a transfer?"" The vocal support of the rapporteur is an important first step for Gonzalez. The Council of State's decision will be announced in the coming days. If her request is denied, Gonzalez has planned to appeal the decision with the European Court of Human Rights. But time is running out for Gonzalez. According to Spanish law, postmortem insemination is only legal if it takes place within the year following the death of the father, giving Gonzalez until July 10 to attempt the procedure.

267,267,11-11-16 18:00,2016,11,11,Mike Diver,Discussing the Enduring Appeal of Abe with Oddworld Creator Lorne Lanning," In 2017, the original PlayStation's  Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee will celebrate its 20th anniversary. The game, released at a time when console and home computer power was pushing virtual worlds into three dimensions like never before (step forward  GoldenEye 007,  Final Fantasy VII​​, ​​​​and the  Quake and  Tomb Raider sequels)  looked like a step backwards for what these creations could be.  A side-on, 2D platformer,  Abe's Oddysee​ didn't ostensibly seem like a progression from the 16-bit Marios and Sonics. But look deeper than a few screenshots, and that basic ""platformer"" pigeonhole, and  Abe's Oddysee was quite clearly something else.  Abe, the game's player-controlled hero, was anything but an all-conquering, stereotypical power-fantasy protagonist bristling. He had  some tricks up his (entirely non-existent) sleeve: He could telepathically control enemies, and was light-footed enough to tiptoe past many a spot of potential bother. But while he finds himself, entirely accidentally, freeing the slaves of a fantastical food-manufacturing multinational corporation—RuptureFarms—he's an everyman, unremarkable and inconspicuous in a crowd.  Or, rather, he's an every-Mukodon, to stick with the game's fictional universe of humanoid creatures separated into distinct classes. The Mukodons are the lowest of the low, the servants of the Glukkons, the game world's elite reptilian race. Abe rescues his ""co-workers"" across the course of  Oddysee, using innovative ""gamespeak"" commands to direct them away from danger, and to their salvation.    Abe's Oddysee received several sequels, and was remade in 2014 as  Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, for modern consoles. The company that made the original, Oddworld Inhabitants, is still involved, and the success of  New 'n' Tasty—the game received fantastic reviews and reconnected Abe with his old audience, while also attracting gamers too young to remember the 1990s—has led the studio to pursue further titles in the Oddworld franchise.  2017 will see the release of a remake, of sorts, of 1998's  Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, a title that, as Oddworld Inhabitants co-founder  Lorne Lanning explains, was never quite what it should have been back in the day. Above: The 'Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty' trailer from E3 2014   Waypoint:  New 'n' Tasty was quite the comeback for Oddworld. I know that you've been teasing what's next, and it makes sense for it to be  Abe's Exoddus, done over. Yet what you're talking about for 2017 is called  Soulstorm. What's that all about?   Lorne Lanning: We actually started Oddworld Inhabitants through wanting to bring more Hollywood-style production values to games. And I think the original  Abe's Oddysee had that, and then came the 3D games,  Munch's Oddysee and  Stranger's Wrath, later down the road. But it was surprising to me, actually, that people want more of that 2D platforming, side-scrolling style stuff, nowadays.  So we tested the waters with  New 'n' Tasty, and the response was great. We polled the audience: What do you want to see next? And they replied with, ""Do  Abe's Exoddus!"" I groaned, but then I looked at that:  Exoddus was a game that we only had nine months on, a game I was never expecting to make. But I've looked at that game, for the next one, for  Soulstorm – I've looked at what the old story was, and rewritten the whole thing. The drink, Soulstorm Brew, is still at the center of things, but that's where the similarities end.  What we really want to do with  Soulstorm is make it devious, highly volatile. And also, we're working with these ideas: In the first game, it's about Abe awaking from being a slave. He's the catalyst for more following his lead—they all realize they're not employees, they're slaves. No allegories to our world there,  of course.  And in the next one, the  original intent for part two was that the slaves wake up to the fact they're also slaves to their own habits, and addictions. So that's where this Brew, this drink, comes in—it's enslaving people around the world.  But Brew is sticky, and highly flammable. A long time ago, we designed mechanics for liquid fire, like napalm, but with the ability to splash surfaces and coat things, and then ignite it. We've got that going now. And what falls out of that is actually extreme comedy.  People were asking: is the next game going to be darker? And it is, because Abe's going through a heavier trip, and realizing it's not all fun and games, and realizing the scope of his task. He never signed up for this, to save the world; he just sort of stumbled into it. So we're getting more into what I wanted  Abe's Exoddus to originally be. It's an all-new game; a reboot, I suppose, rather than a remake. But it definitely still has that Oddworld humor, it's honestly more hilarious than it ever was.  We  have to get the game out in 2017. I suffer every time I provide a specific date, because people will take that as gospel, that it will be out then—when what we mean is we'd  like to have it out by then. But, we feel it has to be in 2017, and so I'm on this night and day, until it delivers, and that's just how it is. ​Abe was never an obvious hero, beside more stereotypical avatars that crush all before them. And yet here we are, almost 20 years after the first game, and he's an incredibly loved character. Tell me a little about how he came to be, and why you think he's endured.  I'm of the belief that if you can make characters more emotional, and empathetic, then you're going to have a greater connection to them, and you'd feel for them in ways that I never felt for the guy with the big gun and the big biceps. Who gives a shit that he can kick ass better? Those kind of characters—I'm gonna be the ace pilot and save the day—they're a little done. I'm more into people who work in the pizza place, who are also going to save the world. He's going to do it in a really interesting way.   Microsoft did some focus testing and basically told us, ""Abe and Munch came back as two characters most likely to be in the corner at the party, with lamp shades on their heads."" They certainly were never the embodiment of cool. But the reason I did that is because I felt that's where we were all at, what we were all in. We were in that position of being small, and helpless against a world of a lot of forces, and a lot of assholes, running things and fucking it up for the rest of us. And, gee, I feel like I'm getting validated now: you've got to be a dipshit to not recognize that's what's going on in the world today, that the assholes are winning.  Abe really resonates with the inner chump within us all who feels vulnerable, who feels like we might not make it, and that all of this stuff in the real world is overwhelming. And I know he's connected with people, because I've seen a lot of Abe tattoos. I met one dude, a big dude, like 300 pounds, and he had Abe on one ass cheek, and (Abe's sort of sidekick) Elum on the other. Like, how did they wind up  there?  The things those characters have seen, in that location.  I'd never encourage anyone to get a tattoo, but I was really surprised when I started seeing them. I always wanted characters that people would feel strongly about; but also that the characters mean something else to them, personally. I felt like people were small victims in the world, and as a result I wanted to make characters that were closer to them—not the best looking guy, not the strongest. But then, they could still overcome obstacles. Out of that, I felt we could build more empathy into the play pattern, even if we were being sarcastic, and dark at times. All of that helped build this connection between Abe and the player.  ​Where do you think  you fit, in the gaming landscape of the 21st century? Here we have these kind of throwback games, and I know you're not into the power-trip adventures that do the big numbers, commercially.  There are things that are exciting today. I do look at the amazing graphics, and I'm wowed. I respect that the world's a violent place, but I see all these games  about killing, and that doesn't rock my house. We kill things in our games, too, but there's a difference between what we do and just being gratuitous. I'm not into the war games, the games that celebrate war, when people are losing their lives right now in the real world, and being totally disrupted as a result of conflict. We're turning that into entertainment products, so billionaires can make more money. I'm not excited about that shit, and I'd never do that kind of stuff.   You seem pretty pissed off at the world, Lorne. I'm getting that vibe.  Well, let's just look at who's winning in the world, right now. Hedge fund managers. Bankers. Corporate CEOs taking thousands of times the pay of those working under them. I mean, it's  ridiculous. And it's been like this for ages—it was the disappointments of the real world that really inspired the Oddworld characters, originally. And I feel like, when I was a kid growing up, the hardest commodity for me to get in touch with was  hope.  When I think back to when I was growing up, at times I just wanted to go jump off the bridge. There were all of these really intimidating barriers in the way. And it's worse today, for young people—far worse than when I was growing up. And what iconic characters do kids today have to hold onto? For me, when I was a kid, it was Yoda. And now Yoda is trying to sell me fucking soft drinks.  When I saw  Star Wars, it filled a gap for me, and I think it did this for a lot of people, because there was a sort of spiritual deficit out there at the time. You had two schools: religion, or spirituality if you like, or atheism. But I always thought there was more. I grew up in the woods. My best friends were animals. My dog had more empathy when stuff was going wrong for me than any human I knew. So Yoda spoke to me: The Force connects all living things. It was a very Buddhist approach, and I sort of see  Star Wars as Shaolin Monks in Space.  Then I realized: Kermit the Frog, and Ernie and Bert, and the Count on  Sesame Street,  they taught me to read. Not school. I learned from entertainment characters. I felt more connected to what Yoda was saying than any other traditional deities.  So to me, characters can mean a  lot more. The songs I used to listen to, perhaps they prevented me from jumping off that bridge. You get empowered by this stuff. You see tattoos of lyrics, and that's the deeper meaning for the people that have them, on their life. And when I'm designing characters, I'm trying to come from that place where, if it registers with people, can they identify with it in regard to their own plight in life. And if they can, they'll embrace it deeper.   When we find something we really love, let's say it's a band, and someone else is trashing them? ""Listen, motherfucker…"" We're going to stand up for them. ""That's my family!"" We get passionate. And that's the best fan cultures. Go talk to Trekkies about how much you hate  Star Trek, and see how you go. That conversation—well, that screaming match—is going to go on all night.  So, I hope to always focus on characters that mean more to people than just what the surface story is. And I think that resonated, with Abe. And the challenges of business get in the way, and you stumble over them; but with Abe, the reason I gave him infinite lives is because I wanted you to never give up. No matter how fucking sucky you were, if you stuck with it, you'd get there. And that's life, man.  It's nice when that happens, when you make that connection. But of course you need sales, too. But, I believe, if you're going to make entertainment, don't just do it to make a buck. Do what you have to do to pay the rent, of course; but if you have the luxury of having a  choice in what you do for a job, try to make the world better. I'm not saying what that is, as our situations are all different, but I think that's what we all need to do, now.  This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

268,268,20-06-17 18:47,2017,6,20,Nathaniel Ainley,Let This Adorable Animation Womansplain the Clitoris," A playful animated film uses humor and illustration to deconstruct the biological logistics and historical context behind the only organ in the human body dedicated exclusively to pleasure:  Le Clitoris. The documentary short by Montreal native Lori Malepart-Traversy delves into the physical anatomy of the clitoris and how it has been skewed and misinterpreted by different men throughout history.  The history of the clit stretches all the way back to the days of Ancient Greece when female orgasm was encouraged by doctors for better fertility. Up until the 19th century, even the Catholic church approved of female orgasm to release sexual tension. However, in the early 1800s doctors started to rail against the clit, claiming it was a useless organ that made women susceptible to dangerous diseases like ""hysteria."" Then Sigmund Freud came along and proclaimed, ""a mature woman must find her pleasure exclusively through penetration,"" relegating the clitoris to what Malepart-Traversy calls ""clitoral obscurantism.""   Malepart-Traversy spent eight months drawing and animating  Le Clitoris while she was getting her BFA from Concordia University. During the process, the artist says she strived for simplicity and efficiency, using animation as a vehicle to discuss delicate subject matter. Malepart-Traversy tells Cartoon Brew, ""Humor puts less pressure on the viewer... on what you should think or what you should say... Making the viewer laugh is a good way to enter the subject.""  By creating a character out of the clitoris, Malepart-Traversy hopes people will start to look at it as ""something more alive than just a flap, or vulva, or hole, or vagina."" Last year,  Le Clitoris was showcased at film festivals around the world. The documentary was finally released to the public two days ago.

269,269,21-06-19 00:00,2019,6,21,,UPDATE 1-Trump says he halted U.S. strike on Iran over possible casualties,"(Adds details, Trump comments)  WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he called off a planned military strike against Iran because it would have been a disproportionate response to Tehran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone, adding that more sanctions have been imposed.  “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights (sic) when I asked, how many will die,” Trump wrote in a series of morning tweets. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General.  “10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry.”  Trump said U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran were having an effect and, without mentioning details, said more were added Thursday night.  Iranian officials told Reuters on Friday that Tehran had received a message from Trump warning that a U.S. attack on Iran was imminent but that he was against war and wanted to talk.  Trump’s tweets did not address whether he had sent a message to Iran’s leaders but repeated his attacks on the deal secured by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. He also reiterated his stance that Iran would not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.  The escalating tensions come after Tehran on Thursday said it had shot down an unmanned U.S. military surveillance drone with a surface-to-air missile following a spate of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf region.

272,272,07-06-19 00:00,2019,6,7,Michael Georgy,Sudan hospital traumatized by bloody crackdown,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - After the victims of a deadly crackdown on a protest camp started pouring into a Khartoum hospital, many previous patients there begged to leave in terror, overwhelming doctors.  Some of the militiamen who raided the pro-democracy sit-in had surrounded Royal Care hospital to hunt protesters taking refuge in the building, said its deputy director, Dr. Mohammed Abdel Rahman.  “People were crying and screaming,” he told Reuters. “They were desperate to leave ... while we were trying to cope with hundreds in serious condition who were arriving.”  The opposition says 113 people were killed in the storming of the civilian sit-in on Monday and a subsequent wider crackdown. The government put the death toll at 61 people, including three security personnel.  The bloodshed dashed hopes that Sudan’s new military rulers - who overthrew veteran leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir on April 11 - would hand over power quickly to civilians.  Shortly after the violence erupted, the hospital declared code black, meaning the 100-bed facility was operating at full capacity. But doctors had no choice.  Three hundred people who were either hit by bullets, beaten with batons, or whipped with long wooden sticks, were in dire need of treatment. Five days later, the hospital still cannot cope.  Exhausted doctors and other staff have no relief – working around the clock because other colleagues cannot make it to Sudan’s biggest private hospital.  There are only 20 physicians.  Aside from treating patients, they have taken over nursing and administrative duties and even cleaning floors because there is no one else to do the job.  “I felt bad staying at home but there was nothing I could do,” said senior administrator Ramah Rahma. “Either the roads were blocked or I had to go back home because of gunfire.”  Six people died from gunshot wounds, two of them before arriving. But the majority are suffering from bone fractures and whippings which leave long scars along their backs.  “They were struck with batons mostly in the upper arms and shoulders and lower legs, mostly ankles,” said Abdel Rahman.  He said stress levels peaked after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which stand accused of genocide in the war against rebels in Darfur, arrived by the hundreds in pick up trucks and formed a cordon around the hospital to search for protesters.  Bashir’s government denied the genocide charges.  The RSF was not immediately available for comment.  The Transitional Military Council (TMC) has said the force has a strong track record of fighting terrorism and a fabricated social media campaign was aimed at smearing them.  On Friday, there were no RSF forces within site of the hospital. Some were relaxing and sipping cups of tea along roads outside the Defense Ministry where protesters had gathered by the hundreds of thousands to demand democracy.  A few of them, who once punched their fists in the air to call for radical change, were collecting garbage left along the former protest camp site where people from all walks of life had gathered - women, teenagers, doctors, accountants, vendors.  On Friday, there was barely any movement in the hospital. A few nurses quietly stood at their stations. The emergency room was empty. No one was attending labs.  During the height of the crisis, when patients needed medicine and other supplies, the hospital’s one functioning ambulance was the only vehicle available - because doctors feared others would be targeted.  “I have never experienced anything like this. I used to work in a military hospital. It was simple,” said Abdel Rahman.   “You treat a soldier and he would say I am going home. Here it was one patient wanting to tell you their story but you have to move on to another one beside you.”  On one hospital ward, victims lay in bed, with metal rods holding together legs and arms shattered by bullets.   Some had spent their time at the sit-in area listening to opposition leaders speak, or studying the photographs of army officers executed on orders of Bashir. They had high hopes of a brighter future, until the bullets started flying on Monday.  Another patient, Mohammed Abdel Baqi, said he was not interested in politics and was not taking part in the sit-in. He was at a market shopping for clothes to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.  “Security forces just showed up and started firing,” said the 22-year-old trader, who said he had planned to move to Saudi Arabia to seek a better life, a decision that had nothing to do with politics.  Some are hopeful for Sudan’s future, despite the high price they are paying for pushing for civilian rule.  Down the hall, a university student said he hoped security forces should stand by the Sudanese people. He struggled to slowly make the victory sign, his hand passing close to a large metal rod attached to his leg.

Nashville Metro Police Spokesman Don Aaron said Shaw’s actions saved lives.  “The shots had stopped, so he decided to rush the gunman, actually wrestled that assault rifle away, tossed it over the counter and, at that point, the gunman fled,” he said.   Authorities said the suspected gunman, identified as 29-year-old Travis Reinking, remained at large on Sunday night..  Shaw, who said he works for AT&T, recalled how when he and McMurry were at the Waffle House when they heard a crash, which he initially thought was plates breaking.  He then saw the gunman, who was dressed in a green jacket and nothing else, open fire. When Shaw moved toward the bathroom, the shooter followed him, making him feel trapped.  “I distinctly remember thinking that he is going to have to work for this kill,” he said.  Shaw said that when he saw the gunman pause to reload, he saw his opportunity and snatched the gun, which he said was hot to the touch, and threw it away.  He sported a bandage over his right hand where he was burned grabbing the barrel.  “I didn’t care. It was life or death at that time,” Shaw said at the news conference, adding he went home afterward, got changed and went to church.  He said the whole moment seemed “light-switch” fast.  “I just wanted to live. I didn’t really fight that man to save everyone else,” he said. “I took the gun so I could get myself out. That may not be popular. But I’m honest to the core. ...

274,274,27-11-17 15:45,2017,11,27,Johanna  Partin,Trump Holds the US Back While Other Countries and American Cities Take Action Against Climate Change," This is an opinion piece by Johanna Partin, Director of the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance  So Syria’s in, but the U.S. is out, at least in Trump’s mind. But what shone through in Bonn, like the brilliant sun powering the new clean economy, is that Trump is the outlier. Not only has every nation represented in Bonn ratified the Paris climate agreement, but the overwhelming American subnational presence in Bonn—from states and cities to CEOs and nonprofits—is fully committed to climate science and climate action. Global collaboration came to the fore in Bonn showing that Paris is becoming a real-world reality. It’s only the Trump Administration, whose pro-fossil fuel panel presentation at Bonn was interrupted by mass protest, that is refusing to get on board. The timing of American obfuscation couldn’t be worse, considering the recent news that the world is set to see greenhouse gas emissions climb by 2 percent in 2017 and again in 2018, which means more warming. This report, which set a fitting stage for former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposal to put a public health warning on fossil fuels (e.g. a label at gas stations saying, “what you pump into your tank may kill you”), follows last month’s news that the world reached record-breaking GHG levels in 2016, higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years.  Everyone in Bonn knew full well that America is responsible for a huge chunk of these emissions, with some of the highest per capita emissions in the world, which makes President Trump’s denialism even more confounding.    Check out more videos from VICE:   The leading highest-ambition cities, in response, called on delegates in Bonn to act immediately on this burgeoning humanitarian crisis, noting in a strongly worded letter at the start of the conference that nation states were not doing nearly enough. The letter, sent by the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, called on nations to ratchet up of ambition and action and match what many cities are doing globally to kick carbon to the curb.  As a result of this and other examples of local government leadership, there were calls in Bonn—most notably from COP23 President, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama—to push for more ambitious climate action, and to include local governments as official parties in the climate negotiations going forward. (UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa has agreed to consider.) If nations match cities’ leadership, and similarly aim for 100 percent renewable energy, near zero carbon, and zero waste, then the world would be well on its way towards a more livable future. As we stand now, however, the Paris pledges are insufficient and fail to keep us below the temperature that most scientists have indicated is necessary for survival.  At present, Paris commitments let the planet warm well over 3 degrees Celsius more than what they were pre-industrialization. We really should be capping our warming to 1.5 degrees. That’s if we want humanity to survive unscathed well into the next century—a task that is tenable provided nations take up the challenge called for by carbon neutral cities.  Bonn, then, and any global climate conference that follows, is about getting governments from the United States to the United Arab Emirates to do as cities do. To set a 0-100 agenda in days not decades, months not millennia, seconds not centuries. To drive towards zero waste, zero carbon and 100 percent renewable energy.  This is the moment that will either make us or break us, as no other threat out there will have a comparable impact to our health, economy and security. And cities can’t do it alone, no matter how much subnational leaders laudably supplant federal governments at UN conferences. We need nation-states to take a lesson from their cities and start leading.  As the global rulebook for the coming years of climate action gets finalized, heads of state should heed what’s happening in their own cities. Because that’s what going to not just save us, but drive us to thrive.   While global leaders are busy debating the future of the planet, you can do your part by getting your local officials to switch to 100 percent renewable energy for the Sierra Club's Ready for 100 campaign.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb399d/trump-holds-the-us-back-while-other-countries-and-american-cities-take-action-against-climate-change,Voices,Vice
275,275,13-04-16 14:55,2016,4,13,Bethy Squires,Take a Guess at What the Most Downloaded Kind of Porn Is in Anti-LGBT States,"It also seems worth mentioning that, according to GameLink's numbers, Utah downloads the most incest related titles.  House Bill 2 was signed into law by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory in early April. The law bans anti-discrimination measures that would protect people from being fired for their sexual orientation or gender presentation. It also outlaws people from using a public restroom that doesn't match the gender on their birth certificate. HB 2 has been characterized as borderline unenforceable by North Carolina police, a last gasp of ""prejudice and bigotry"" by Bruce Springsteen, and ""fucking stupid"" by most people who read it. Many trans men took to twitter and Facebook to protest the law, arguing that people who look like them are the last people NC lawmakers want in a women's restroom. But it would appear that the average North Carolinian would be more familiar with the struggle of the trans women in Italian Transsexual Sausage Fest 5-Pack, another popular title on GameLink. The site also ranks Mississippi sixth in its viewing of gay porn, but number one in hypocrisy. The top five movies watched in Mississippi on GameLink over the last 90 days are Full Service Transsexuals, Fathers and Sons Number 3, Bareback Sex, Daddy and Me, and ever-popular Joey Silvera's Trans-Visions 6. ""Our user data show Mississippi has been consuming gay and transsexual pornography at a high rate in comparison to the rest of the country,"" says Dillon. ""It's unfortunate to see that their diverse viewing habits do not translate into an open-minded society."" Mississippi House Bill 1532 was signed into law April 5. In it, marriage is defined as between one man and one woman, and insists that ""male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth""—a laughably useless set of criteria which doesn't take into account the one in 1400 people born outside of XX and XY chromosomal typing, and the one in 100 people born with bodies that do not have ""standard"" male/female genitalia (according to the Intersex Society of North America). One can view the high consumption of gay porn in Mississippi and trans porn in North Carolina as hypocritical, but an argument also could be made that the hypersexualization of trans bodies directly correlates with perceiving them as a threat. A sexy, sexy threat. Why, any minute now we could be ravished by a dashing trans man named Slaven with salt and pepper hair, and a smile like a secret, and the secret is that he loves you. Governor McCrory signed an executive order on April 12, preventing state employees from being fired for being gay or trans, while keeping the most controversial bathroom-related parts of the bill. In a video, he said that North Carolina is ""a state that strives to allow our people and business to as independent as possible, without overreaching government regulations."" He neglected to mention whether his newfound softening on the issue was because of backlash from entities like the ACLU and Paypal, or the humanizing effect of films like My Girlfriend's Cock 17.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg7jgv/take-a-guess-at-what-the-most-downloaded-kind-of-porn-is-in-anti-lgbt-states,Identity,Vice

278,278,30-03-16 16:00,2016,3,30,Max Fisher,This 3-minute cartoon explains why nuclear weapons still pose a very real threat,"Nuclear weapons are something so scary and so dangerous — thousands of weapons explicitly designed to be powerful enough to destroy the world many times over, perpetually deployed, and able to be fired with the push of a few buttons, like a gun forever left to the world's head — that I'm sometimes amazed at how little we talk about them. There are a few reasons for that. One is that they're so big and scary it can be difficult for people to wrap their heads around. Another is that there's an impression — not entirely true, as I'll explain — that nothing ever changes with nukes, so we're just in a peaceful status quo. But another is just that the scale of the threat still posed by nukes might not be obvious to everyone. So it's worth laying that out, as this three-minute cartoon by the popular series Minute Physics does. It's a good overview, and more than a little scary: As Max Tegmark of MIT explains in the video, the real risk of nukes is that they'll be set off in some sort of mistake. But — and this is important — when experts like Tegmark talk about the mistaken use of nuclear weapons, they're not talking about a random or otherwise accidental detonation (although that has almost happened a few times). Rather, they're talking about geopolitical tensions between nuclear-armed powers that, by some confusion or unintended escalation, could become a nuclear exchange before anyone realized it was all a big misunderstanding. There are two general ways that could happen. The first are the sorts of incidents Tegmark goes through in the video: One side misperceives the other as launching a nuclear weapon. Because nuclear weapons take only minutes to deliver, the side that believes it is under attack has only minutes to respond — not enough time to investigate what's happening before retaliating. As Tegmark explains, this has happened a few times. Blessedly, thankfully, when faulty readings led one side to believe it was under nuclear attack, the people on that side simply chose not to follow the rules requiring them to retaliate. The 1983 incident he cites (which I retell in full here) was probably the closest we ever came to total nuclear annihilation, avoided because the Soviet lieutenant colonel on duty refused to follow protocol requiring him to retaliate. The second way this could happen is that an actual conflict could break out between two nuclear powers. As this conflict escalated, each side would watch the other obsessively for any sign of a nuclear strike. And some countries, such as Russia, have rules allowing their militaries to use nuclear weapons, in certain circumstances, even if the other side has not. Again, because the logic of nuclear weapons requires a lightning-fast retaliation to any nuclear launch, there would be dozens of ways in which the two sides could misread some action or escalation as the start of a nuclear attack, and launch what they believe is a retaliation (meant to return in kind and thus prevent more strikes) but would actually be a first strike. So why do we still have these things if they put us in a state of constant, if low-level, risk of global annihilation? Tegmark makes it sound like the answer is money from defense contractors, but I'm not sure it's so simple. (It's not like Northrop Grumman existed in the communist Soviet Union, which long resisted nuclear disarmament.) The challenge is this: Both American and Soviet/Russia leaders have expressed a desire to reduce their own stockpiles, but they only want to do it if the other side reciprocates in turn. They want to maintain the strategic balance between their two countries' nuclear arsenals, and they also know that if they disarm unilaterally, they'll lose leverage to get the other side to disarm. So disarmament happens jointly, in painstakingly negotiated agreements, which also include painstakingly negotiated inspections and monitoring regimes to make sure the other side is holding to their end. That is extremely difficult and time-consuming even in periods of relative friendliness between Moscow and Washington. But in periods of tension — right now, for example — the distrust is just too high, and the domestic politics within both countries make such agreements too politically costly anyway. The upshot of all this is that we're left, more or less perpetually, in a Cold War–era status quo, in which both the US and Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world many times over, have nuclear war plans that require doing exactly that, and have forward-deployed those warheads in a way that is meant to deter the other side but also substantially increases the risk of unintended conflict by reducing our response time to mere minutes. That's the status quo, and it's pretty bad. But it gets worse, because the status quo isn't really static. Military technology is constantly changing, and both sides are constantly making upgrades that require the other side to upgrade in turn. So, for example, the US develops a new stealth fighter jet and bomber, which leads Russia to develop better air defense systems. But the problem is that these changes also affect nuclear weapons technology, which means the carefully balanced nuclear equilibrium is constantly being destabilized. Take, for example, those improved Russian air defense systems. The American nuclear deterrent is designed to have three components — submarines, bombers, and land-based missiles — known as the triad. Russia's new air defenses make the air-based part of our triad weaker. So to maintain parity, we are developing a new air-launched cruise missile that can carry nuclear weapons. But this new weapon, by maintaining parity in some respects (ability to penetrate air defenses), destabilizes parity on others (it reduces Russia's response time and could be perceived as a first-strike weapon). At the same time, this weapon increases the risk that a conventional conflict with Russia could spiral into an unwanted nuclear exchange, because Moscow would be unable to differentiate a conventional cruise missile from a nuclear cruise missile. This is all a very long way (sorry, I get carried away on this topic) of saying that this video describes the threats of nuclear weapons well but, if anything, significantly understates those threats. This all speaks to what you could maybe call the biggest myth about nuclear weapons, which is that we're in a peaceful stasis, with parity between the US and Russian forces providing stability. In fact, both sides are constantly doing things to manage that parity that also involve disturbing it, sometimes in ways that can be destabilizing and can increase the risk of an accident, misunderstanding, or unintended escalation. That risk is extremely low and the increases are marginal, but given the potential consequences — the literal end of the world — it's still pretty scary stuff.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11331218/nuclear-weapons-threat,,Vox
279,279,20-06-19 00:00,2019,6,20,Lefteris Karagiannopoulos,Clean energy projects worth $1.5 billion seek Finnish aid,"OSLO (Reuters) - Fifteen companies have applied for Finnish investment aid to partly fund new large-scale demonstration energy projects worth $1.5 billion, six of them replacing coal and other fossil fuels, the government said on Thursday.  Finland aims to reduce its carbon emissions and it approved earlier in the year a ban on the use of coal in energy production by May 2029, forcing some of its biggest utilities to find alternative energy solutions.   The government has promised some investment aid for large-scale energy demonstration projects that contribute to meeting national as well as European Union energy and climate objectives by 2030.  Only projects with investment costs exceeding 5 million euros could apply for the aid, said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which intends to allocate a total of 40 million euros to co-fund some of them.  “The total amount of funding requested for these projects was 140 million euros,” the ministry said in a statement on Thursday, without naming the 15 companies that have applied.  Of the applications, six concern replacing coal and other fossil fuels in urban areas, four are biorefinery projects, and five are related to new energy technology, it added.  The ministry expects to select the projects it will fund in November 2019.  The projects to be funded will be selected based mainly on the degree of innovation of their selected technology and also  their feasibility, the amount of energy produced, cost-effectiveness, and other impacts, it said.

281,281,04-04-16 19:44,2016,4,4,Nick Gazin,Nick Gazin's Comic Book Love-In #110,"Hello All, I'm Nick Gazin, and this is the weekly VICE comics review column in which I let you know what you should read and what you should avoid. If you contact me, I can tell you other things you should do too. Let me run your reading itinerary and your whole life. Here are ten things that I've reviewed. I include links that you can use to purchase the books directly from their publishers, but I encourage everyone to patronize their local comic stores.  #1. AmsterdamBy Simon Hanselmann (Fantagraphics) Simon Hanselmann is perhaps the best new-ish cartoonist going right now. When trying to convince people that comics can be cool, good, fun, enjoyable, relatable, and pretty, I always use his books as an example.  If you're unfamiliar with Simon's work, you can read the stuff we've published of his on this very site. Most of this book is on this website, but the experience of reading a book and looking at a website isn't the same. Books are great, paper is perfect.  The comics in this book are about a group of friends who all seem to hate each other. There's a witch named Megg, her cat boyfriend, their giant Owl roommate, and their sociopathic friend Werewolf Jones. A whole lot of stuff happens in Amsterdam, from Megg and Mogg chugging giant bottles of Red Bull to Werewolf Jones's nude Zelda marathons. There's infidelity, suffering, beak-breaking, and various other pains for the reader's enjoyment. At the end of the last book, Owl had a moment of isolated tranquility. At the end of Amsterdam, Megg retreats into herself with mood-stabilizing drugs. Will Mogg be alone at the end of the next book? We all die alone, and we all read comics alone.  You can cuddle up on your couch either by yourself or with your favorite drugs and just read it, touch it, smell the paper, and be in love with it. Books rule, the internet drools. Paper rules forever. I love this book, I love Simon Hanselmann.  Buy Amsterdam.  #2. Elevator TeethPublished by Perfectly Acceptable Press This is an avant-garde comic that feels a little influenced by primitive computer games with its grids and silhouettes. There's text, images, figures, and things that seem to be about the Bible, the creation of man—it doesn't matter. Whatever it means, it's a nice object full of pretty colors, patterns, and images.  Buy Elevator Teeth.  #3. HAXBy Lale Westvind (Breakdown Press) Lale Westvind has some great Hairy Who/Gary Panter silkscreen magic happening in her work. This color zine starts with some portraits of pained-faced women before launching into a wordless story that I couldn't follow but enjoyed looking at. For some reason the cover, which is very beautiful, looks nothing like the insides, which are also beautiful. I'd like to see more things from Lale that look like the cover. I'd like to see more covers that look like the insides. The cover paper is waxed and soft. Touching this book is half its beauty. When you experience a book, it should appeal to all of your senses except taste. Keep your mouths off the books.  Buy HAX.  #4. Star WrsBy Mark Todd Mark Todd made 70 of these so you probably can't get one now, but I still want to put Mark Todd on your radar. This fine book is a fine, fine book—as fine as a book can be. Mark retells the story of the movie Star Wars as if he's vaguely remembering from having seen it decades ago. Dialogue is flipped, characters are flopped, but the story is told successfully with good jokings and fine, fine drawings. Mark Todd's lines are so beautiful to me. I'm all about line quality. I don't fuck around with people who have an unsophisticated line. One of the first major steps of learning to draw is learning to love the immediacy of mark-making. You have to be able to love drawing before you even get into the concept of making an image. Mark Todd, I love your line, and I can tell that you love your line too. Line lovers for life.  Buy Star Wrs.  #5. Horn PleaseBy Dan Eckstein (powerHouse Books) In India, the trucks are made into beautiful art, and this book documents it. Not much more needs to be said. The whole book is pretty photos of these mundane machines that have been transformed into sublimely beautiful, giant, mobile art objects.  Buy Horn Please.  #6. The Complete Junior and SunnyBy Al Feldstein (IDW/Futurism) Before Al Feldstein drew, wrote, and edited pornographically scary comics for EC, he wrote and drew some way-too-sexy Archie knock-off comics in the 1940s. All the female characters in this book have over-rendered sweater drapery, defining their racks in a way that makes the fabric look wet and clingy. On top of tits being the star of the comic, the main characters all have these double-bubble pompadour hairstyles that look like inflated bosoms on top of their foreheads.  There's one story in here where the fake-Betty and fake-Veronica audition to be models for a department store and model lingerie for an adult man at their high school. Check this out if you have a fetish for tight sweaters.  Buy The Complete Junior and Sunny.  #7. The Blonde WomanBy Aidan Koch (Space Face) Aidan Koch has a lot of good ideas and some taste, but she's not pushing herself hard enough in this book.  Buy The Blonde Woman. #8. The Hospital SuiteBy John Porcellino (Drawn & Quarterly) Reading about John Porcellino's numerous life-threatening ailments and overwhelming physical pain caused me to believe I was experiencing the same symptoms. I began to see spots, and I stopped reading about halfway through. It was too much for me. The experience of the book overwhelmed me. My gut response to this book is, ""Jesus Christ, we've all got to band together to help John Porcellino! Who knew a human was capable of suffering this much without dying!?""  Buy The Hospital Suite.  #9. Sink All NightBy Caramel Bobby I bought this sealed Caramel Bobby zine, and when I opened it I found out that I don't like Caramel Bobby. I guess that's a pretty funny trick. People talk him up so much that I thought he was good. The cover's nice, but ultimately this zine is nothing and was made by someone not trying. Trying is never cool, but very few good artists are cool.  Check out Caramel Bobby.  #10. Carpet Sweeper TalesBy Julie Doucet (Drawn & Quarterly) Julie Doucet has made a lot of great comics, but this isn't one of them. After a long departure from comics, she's returned, but instead of doing work at all similar to her old stuff she's made a collaged fumetti made from old advertisements. The book instructs you to read the text aloud, so I did, but I was still disappointed. I applaud Doucet for taking risks, and I also didn't like this book.  Buy Carpet Sweeper.  That's it for this week. Check back next week, and I'll tell you what to do some more!

Cox, a supporter of Britain staying in the EU, was shot and stabbed after a meeting with residents in her own constituency near Leeds in northern England by a man who witnesses said had shouted ""Britain first"". She was pronounced dead just over 48 minutes later by a doctor working with a paramedic crew trying to save her life. A 52-year-old man named by media as Thomas Mair was arrested by officers nearby and weapons including a firearm were recovered. The killing prompted campaigning to be suspended in the EU referendum, the tone of which has become increasingly angry and bitter and included personal recriminations as well as furious debate of issues such as immigration and the economy. It was not immediately clear when campaigning for the referendum would resume. A spokesman for the ""Vote Leave"" campaign said they would clarify plans later in the day. Britain mourned lawmaker Jo Cox on Friday after a man wielding a gun and knife killed the 41-year-old in an attack that has thrown a June 23 referendum on European Union membership into limbo.

It was not immediately clear when campaigning for the referendum would resume. A spokesman for the ""Vote Leave"" campaign said they would clarify plans later in the day. The implied probability of a vote for Britain to remain in the EU rose to 67 percent, up from 65 percent on Thursday, according to Betfair odds. Though the motives of the killer were not immediately clear, some suggested sympathy for Cox could boost the Remain campaign which opinion polls indicate had fallen behind Leave. Police said they were not in a position to discuss the motive of the attack. ""Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy and a zest for life that would exhaust most people,"" Cox's husband, Brendan, said. Related: Obama's 'Town Hall' Meeting with British Youth Covered Gender Rights, Islamophobia, and Leadership ""She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her."" A US civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), based in Alabama, said on its website that it had obtained records showing a Thomas Mair had links with the neo-Nazi organization National Alliance (NA) dating back to 1999. The SPLC posted images showing what it said were purchase orders for books bought by Mair, whose address is given as Batley, from the NA's publishing arm National Vanguard Books in May of that year. The orders included a manual on how to build a pistol, it said. Britain's Union flag was flying at half-mast over the Houses of Parliament, Queen Elizabeth's London residence Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, where Prime Minister David Cameron has his official residence. In Birstall hundreds of people attended a vigil at a local church. Queen Elizabeth was due to write a private letter of condolence to Cox's husband. Some people, many weeping, laid flowers outside the Houses of Parliament. Beside a picture of Cox smiling, dozens of white candles lay beside bunches of flowers and a message board upon which people had written their condolences. ""You can't kill democracy,"" read one message on Parliament Square. Another said: ""We will unite against hatred."" Others put flowers on the houseboat on the River Thames where Cox had lived with her husband and two young children aged three and five. Beside flowers at the murder scene in Birstall, a message read: ""Fascists feed on fear."" British politicians paid tribute to Cox and expressed shock at the killing, as did leaders across Europe and the world. Cameron said the killing of Cox, who had worked on US President Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign, was a tragedy. Related: 'A Historic Turning Point?'

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the attack ""terrible"" but added that she didn't want to link it to the EU referendum. Media reports, citing witnesses, said the attacker had shouted out ""Britain first,"" the name of a right-wing nationalist group that describes itself on its website as ""a patriotic political party and street defense organization"". The deputy leader of the group, Jayda Fransen, distanced it from the attack, which she described as ""absolutely disgusting"". West Yorkshire's elected Police and Crime Commissioner said ""our information is that this is a localized incident, albeit one that has a much wider impact"". Family members, including his brother, said that Mair had not expressed strong political views, the Guardian newspaper reported. ""He has a history of mental illness but he has had help,"" the Guardian quoted his brother, Scott Mair, as saying. ""My brother is not violent and is not all that political. I don't even know who he votes for."" Neighbors described a man who had lived in the same house for at least 40 years and helped locals weed their flowerbeds and inquired after their pets. ""I'm totally devastated — I didn't want to believe it. He's been very helpful to me. Anything I asked him to do he did very willingly and sometimes without my needing to ask,"" said next-door neighbor Diana Peters, 65.

The last British lawmaker to have been killed in an attack was Ian Gow, who died after a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) exploded under his car at his home in southern England in 1990. Colleagues expressed shock and disbelief at the death of Cox, a Cambridge University graduate who spent a decade working for aid agency Oxfam and promoted women's issues. ""We've lost a wonderful woman, we've lost a wonderful member of parliament, but our democracy will go on,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a televised statement.

It’s a move that Neal Levine, for one, has been anticipating. Based in Denver, he’s been campaigning for marijuana liberalization since the early days of the George W. Bush administration. But where Levine differs from many marijuana advocates is that he identifies as a libertarian, specifically the type of libertarian who calls taxation “confiscation.” His first political gig was working for the maverick wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura. After nearly 20 years of activism (both paid and unpaid) he now lobbies in Colorado and Washington, DC, for Livwell Enlightened Health, one of Colorado’s biggest weed retailers.  Despite the GOP’s historic aversion to marijuana, Levine regards legalization as a natural cause for conservatives, so much so that after the election of Donald Trump he teamed with industry grandees to establish the New Federalism Fund, a organization aiming to win the administration over to supporting legalization.  “The social justice component of the marijuana argument—all of which is completely legitimate— has been prominent for some time,” he told me over the phone from Livwell’s headquarters shortly after Sessions’s announcement. “By contrast, the New Federalism Fund was set up to talk  to the right,  from the right, using the language of the right.”  The NFF wants to win over the right by appealing to one of its most deeply held philosophical principles: that states should be free to set their own destinies with limited interference from the federal government.  But while states’ rights has long been a popular rallying call for conservatives, it’s become apparent in the Trump era that not everyone on the right believes that states should really have all that much leeway, with the administration trying to crack down on “sanctuary cities” that don’t assist the feds' efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. But that hasn’t stopped Levine from appealing to legislators in an effort to get them to leave states alone when it comes to marijuana. “Our view is that states should be the laboratories of democracy,” Levine said. “The authors of the Constitution intended that states should be free to pursue their own social and policy changes, when the impact is limited within their own political territory. “Federalism is always challenged on the difficult things; not those easy issues where there is broad consensus,” he said. “Marijuana represents the ideal opportunity for the administration to reaffirm its commitment to the principle that states should have the power to decide.” But the NFF’s argument goes beyond constitutional theory: Convinced it can build traction with the White House, the NFF has deployed Trumpian language in its promo materials, calling on the administration to promote “American prosperity” and back “American job creators.”  On Capitol Hill, the NFF has called on conservative lawmakers to strip away a bit of IRS code that leaves legitimate marijuana businesses paying eye-watering amounts in taxes. Known as 280E, this line of tax code was created in the early 80s in response to an audacious attempt by drug cartels to profit from corporate tax rules. Today, 280E prevents any company from deducting business expenses connected to federally prohibited substances like marijuana. The end result is that many marijuana businesses are paying tax rates north of 70 percent.  “We aren’t asking for special favors,” Levine said. “Marijuana businesses just want to be treated like everyone else. People assume we’re swimming in money. What they don’t realize is that if you’re in the cannabis business the government is helping itself to pretty much everything that you’re taking.” Last year, 15 House Republicans pledged their support for a new initiative to deliver “tax parity” by overruling the hated 280E (that’s three times the number of Republicans who supported a similar bill in 2015). And there are other signs of conservatives willing to rethink their traditional opposition. Last week, several prominent Republicans—largely those representing weed-friendly states—publicly criticized Sessions’s anti-weed move, among them Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner, who opposed legalization in his state but is now leading the charge against the Justice Department’s perceived overreach.  Although these moves might make headlines, the fact remains that the vast majority of Republicans oppose the liberalization of weed. The Rohrabacher–Farr Amendment—a bipartisan measure intended to stop federal agencies interfering with states’ medical marijuana programs—has been consistently opposed by the majority of House Republicans. Likewise, voting data from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) shows that Senate Republicans typically take a much tougher stance on marijuana than their Democrat counterparts.  Among rank-and-file party members, the picture is slightly more nuanced. Although still significantly more skeptical than Democrats, polling data has shown growing support from Republican voters for marijuana liberalization (with some polls even showing narrow majority support), particularly among younger voters.  One of those younger voters is John Baucum. Based in deep-red Texas, he serves as political director of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition. In 2015, he pressed Ted Cruz on his marijuana position, calling on the Texas senator to reiterate his support for states’ rights. Having walked in Republican and marijuana circles, Baucum knows more than most how rarely the two positions go together. Nevertheless, he insists that things are slowly changing. “It used to be that if you were looking to move up professionally within the GOP —or perhaps even stand as a candidate yourself—you had to stay away from controversial topics like marijuana reform,” Baucum told me from Houston. “The emergence of libertarian figures like Rand Paul – and the more populist approach taken by Trump—has made it easier for people who support less state interference with marijuana usage."" “Texas is a conservative state,” he went on. “But over three-quarters of young Republican activists told us they supported some degree of marijuana reform. That might not mean full legalization—it could mean decriminalization or the use of civil penalties—but it shows the progress we are making the case with conservatives.” Sessions’s move doesn’t mean there will be a wave of arrests targeting legal pot dealers, but sellers are nervous. Many fear that mixed signals from Washington may lead to nervousness among banks (who have only recently opened up their services to marijuana merchants), taking the industry back to the dark era of cash-only payments.  In Colorado, most of the big distributors remember the days of having to pay staff and suppliers in brown envelopes, not to mention having to find safe storage for the thousands in cash crossing their counters each day. That isn’t just a major business inconvenience: Having that much cash in transit is a huge public safety issue.  “The New Federalism Fund is happy to keep talking to one member of congress at a time, until they realize this industry is here to stay,” said Levine. “We will keep telling our story to the federal government and make clear that any clampdown could undermine public safety and damage the economies of multiple states.” For cannabis campaigners from both the right and left, the ultimate goal of federally legal weed may seem especially distant right now. But if anti-cannabis laws finally do fall, it’ll likely be because at least some Republicans favor legalization. If nothing else, multibillion-dollar industries have a knack for getting their way.

286,286,18-07-17 00:00,2017,7,18,Peter Malone,A Painter's Fantasies Rendered as Cartoonish Dramas,"Satoshi Kojima’s paintings don’t examine human relationships — they fondle them like a bear fondles picnic food. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Estrangement, reactive humor, the illogic of dreams — any of these descriptors could sum up Satoshi Kojima’s inaugural exhibition at Bridget Donahue, a gathering of painted tableaus featuring cartoonish figures in highly artificial settings. Standing before one, I’m faced with twin males walking in opposite directions along railroad tracks passing an elevated station platform. Both figures have their right hand raised in a hailing gesture, their left lowered as if to estimate the space between their palms and the tracks below. Though the painting’s title, “Last Dance” (2016), hints at an impending and predictably disastrous confrontation with a train, reconciling this threat with the lightness of the painting’s color, its schematic drawing, and the artist’s seeming sardonic indifference to the scene’s outcome, suggests an anesthetized sensibility. For the most part, Kojima’s paintings do not examine human relationships — they fondle them like a bear fondles picnic food. Understated formal elements, often mismatched to the odd events depicted, imply an emotional disconnect that is tenaciously adhered to. Ironically upbeat design patterns reflecting a party-favor aesthetic introduce energy that is then sapped by truncated dramas. Measuring, on average, six to eight feet in either direction, the size of the pieces compels a viewer to return again and again to each canvas, vainly seeking hints about the artist’s feelings toward it. The show’s giddy nihilism is assembled from easily readable individual images that maintain a dark babble of disconcerting humor. “Weather Report” (2016) offers a tribal functionary holding a weathervane, pointing with neoclassical élan toward a cartoon raincloud. The Broadway-like sign on the scene’s stagy plinth reads “ECLIPSE.” With little effort, one can imagine it flashing in synch with a repetitive club-music thump — the generic sort one hears in shopping malls. Kojima is both talented and visually astute. In strictly formal terms, each canvas is tightly conceived and carefully contained, but so too are his narrative restrictions. His range seems consciously limited, extending from sentimental encounters like the Beauty and the Beast–themed “Blue Room” (2016) to the advertising glitz of “DJ Box” (2017). What’s missing from the latter is an actual feeling for music and dance. Kojima’s view of the DJ in “DJ Box” feels icy and brittle. To be fair, it is hardly unusual to feel alienated in a dance club. But on balance, most of the situations in Kojima’s paintings are just plain bizarre. “Beautiful Things” (2013) leaves a viewer pondering floating female figures in red heels, presumably pantless, squatting and defecating into cartoon bubbles eagerly grasped from below by robotic males with square heads. Scenes like this suggest an affinity with the work of Peter Williams, a painter of equally odd figurative vignettes, whose big-tent theatrics present viewers with comparably crafted and similarly conjured puzzles. It bears noting that Williams took part in a group show last year at DC Moore called Me, My, Mine that showcased the work of artists who, like Kojima, share an oddly distant alienation from their own subject matter. In light of this unsettling trend, the arrangement of the pieces in this exhibition proved perhaps unintentionally poignant. The palest canvases of the group were hung near the light-flooded front windows of the gallery, while the more intensely colored pictures were placed in the rear, where warmer artificial light amplified their deeper palette. This struck me as counterintuitive. I would have expected to see the brighter pictures near the windows, as they could better withstand the full-spectrum light and thus balance the overall appearance of the installation. As installed, it appears as if Kojimas’s dreams are fading into the light coming in from the Bowery, where the gallery is located. I cannot imagine a more potent metaphor for the art world’s habitual detachment from reality than the sight of “Candy and Whips” (2015) dissolving into actual sunlight, particularly sunlight shining on one of the most historically tragic thoroughfares in NYC. In a jarring way, it emphasizes how the Bowery’s sad and squalid history has been all but erased by its opposite — luxury housing and art galleries touting expensive fantasies. Satoshi Kojima continues at Bridget Donahue (99 Bowery) through August 4. ",https://hyperallergic.com/390909/a-painters-fantasies-rendered-as-cartoonish-dramas/,,Hyperallergic
287,287,26-03-19 00:00,2019,3,26,Tess Owen,All charges dropped against actor Jussie Smollett,"Chicago prosecutors have dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett, the black and gay actor accused of paying two men $3,500 to fake a hate crime against him. “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this is a just and appropriate resolution to the case,” the Cook County State Attorney’s Office said in a statement to ABC News.  Prosecutors, however, did not explain how the charges came to be so abruptly dropped, and the record has now been sealed. “I’ve been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,” Smollett told reporters in a press conference. “I would not be my mother’s son if I had done one drop of what I was accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time, one of the worst in my life.” Chicago police announced on Feb. 21 that Smollett had paid two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to attack him because he was upset that he wasn’t getting paid enough for his role on the Fox series “Empire.” A Cook County grand jury returned a 16-count indictment, including numerous felonies, against Smollett on May 10. The most serious offense was for filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.  Chicago prosecutors have dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett, the black and gay actor accused of paying two men $3,500 to fake a hate crime against him. “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett’s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this is a just and appropriate resolution to the case,” the Cook County State Attorney’s Office said in a statement to ABC News.

The most serious offense was for filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony that carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.  After the charges were dropped on Tuesday, Smollett’s lawyer Patricia Brown Holmes told reporters that the $3,500 payment to the Osundairo brothers was “for nutrition and training.” “They were his trainers,” Holmes said. Holmes didn’t deny, however, that the Osundairo brothers attacked him.  “Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to identify on January 29. He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public, causing an inappropriate rush to judgement,” Holmes and Smollett’s other lawyer, Tina Glandian, said in a statement.  The news is yet another twist in a bizarre case, which stemmed from an alleged attack on the streets of Chicago one night in late January. Smollett alleged that two men — who shouted “MAGA country” alongside racist and homophobic slurs — beat him up, poured bleach on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Weeks later, police said that Smollett paid two brothers to whom he was connected through his work on “Empire,” to stage his attack.  “This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and didn’t deserve,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at the time. Police sources told CBS2 on Tuesday that the news of the charges being dropped blindsided Johnson, who is reportedly “furious.”  Salacious details, from unnamed sources familiar with the Chicago police investigation into Smollett’s case, made their way into local news reports, including the arrest of the Osundairo brothers.  Earlier this month, Chicago police launched an investigation to determine the source of the leaks in the department.  “Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions,” Smollett’s lawyers continued in their statement. “This entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion.”  Smollett’s family also released a statement. “Our son and brother is an innocent man whose name and character has been unjustly smeared,” they wrote. “Jussie is a son, a brother, a partner, a champion for human rights, and a genuine soul who would never be capable of what he was falsely accused of.” Holmes said that Smollett is forfeiting his $10,000 bond but did not say who the beneficiary of the bond would be. In response to a question about why he was forfeiting his bond, Holmes replied: “Plenty of people forfeit their bond in situations like this.”  “He is someone who has dedicated his life to public service since he was 15,” Holmes said. “He has taken the city of Chicago as his home. He is a good, solid citizen of the city of Chicago.” Correction 3/26 12:52 p.m. ET: An earlier version of this story incorrectly state that Smollett was forfeiting $100,000 for his bond. A judge had set his bond at $100,000, but Smollett only had to pay 10 percent. The story has been updated.

But it’s also revealing a split in the party and has Republicans sensing an opening for them to go on the offense.  Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is the loudest voice emerging at the Capitol on climate policy. She’s calling for a “Green New Deal” that would put the nation on the path to a 100 percent renewable energy economy, build a national “smart” energy grid, and boost domestic manufacturing and exporting of emerging “green” technologies. Within days after the midterms, 10 House Democrats had already signed on to the effort, including Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who endorsed it this week.  “It’s about making sure that we can get as progressive and aggressive of legislation as a party on climate change as quickly as possible,” Ocasio-Cortez told VICE News last week.  Republicans still control the White House and the Senate, which means passing any climate-related legislation will be difficult, if not impossible. But Ocasio-Cortez argues her goal goes beyond the new session of Congress. She says the party has to lay the groundwork now so they can tackle it right away if they win back control of the Senate and the White House in 2020.  “It’s not even about passing the Senate,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “It’s that we need to have this legislation drafted by 2020. We can’t wait until 2020 to start doing this work.

But now she’s being pulled by the new vocal progressives in her party, even though many of the Dems' gains on Election Day were in Republican areas where new members could be endangered if they’re forced to vote on a sweeping climate proposal that’s guaranteed to die in the Senate.  ""We can’t wait until 2020 to start doing this work."" The progressive’s demand for a radical rethinking of U.S. energy policy is also complicated by the defeat of an array of climate focused ballot initiatives on Election Day in a couple battleground states, including in Colorado and Arizona (and even in progressive Washington State). Democrats lost seats in 2010 after passing a cap and trade bill — that basically levies a tax on companies for their carbon use — but the politics around climate change have evolved since then, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle.  “Cap and trade is a different issue, because that’s a tax issue,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) told reporters at the Capitol last week, before adding that his state’s three newly elected Democrats are prepared to act on the issue even though they just captured conservative districts. “But climate change alone? You’re not going to lose seats in Virginia over climate change.”  Some veteran Democrats who fear ceding power on the issue are resisting Pelosi’s call for a new special climate committee, because they don’t want their committees to cede control over the issue that falls under their jurisdiction. But Connolly is behind the idea.  “I think actually it enhances everything, because it elevates the issue and allows the legislating committee to then follow up and legislate. So I think they’re complimentary,” Connolly said. Read: Sarah Palin tried to shame Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Here's how that went It’s a different story on the other side of the aisle. Most Republicans are prepared to go to the mat for the fossil fuel industry. In the past two years, President Trump pulled America out of the Paris climate accord and Republicans on Capitol Hill aggressively rolled back any regulation they could. So we'll see whether Democrats go big and bold on climate policy, as Ocasio-Cortez and her allies are advocating, or whether they embrace a more incremental approach.  “I think it’s very important that we elevate climate change in the next Congress. The Republicans completely stymied us.” “I think it’s very important that we elevate climate change in the next Congress. The Republicans completely stymied us,” Kathy Castor (D-FL), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told reporters at the Capitol.  Castor hasn’t made up her mind yet on the mechanics of how her party tackles the looming climate crisis, but she says that’s less important than coming together and making the issue a top priority.  “So whatever, if it’s a select committee, if it’s happening in the jurisdiction of the committee, it’s got to be elevated. We’ve got to decarbonize the atmosphere. We’ve got to do more on renewables. We’ve got to address these extreme weather events,” Castor said. “People back home are crying out for action, and they see the GOP Congress just not meeting the challenge of the changing climate.”  But Republicans still see energy policy as a winning issue for them, and they view talk of a Green New Deal as a gift because they can use it to paint the Democratic Party as extreme in their attempt to recapture some of the seats they just lost.  “They’ve got a really radical agenda.” “They’ve got a really radical agenda,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) told reporters at the Capitol after she was unanimously elected chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, making her the third-most-powerful Republican in the House. “It’s going to be interesting to watch, but I have no doubt that the American people are going to look at what we were able to produce in the majority and compare that to what the Democrats are now saying they’re going to do and trying to do, and the choice will be very clear.”  Cheney has advocated for abolishing the EPA, and she’s now charged with helping her party craft its message.  “We need to get on offense. and especially because we’re in the minority now, we've got to be in a position where we're making sure that we’re out there every day fighting, and I think we’ve got to be sure we’re winning the news cycle,” Cheney said. “We need to make sure we have a more aggressive approach, especially because we're in the minority.""

Gray-bearded, enigmatic and with a huge tattoo of Christ across his back, the former barge operator refuses to disclose his surname. The hut he built himself sits on the banks of the Yenisei River which carves through Siberia.   “I like the company of trees more than the company of people,” he says.   One long-time acquaintance - a former police officer - who knows Viktor from chance encounters while sailing by on a boat says the hermit shunned society after he was jailed - on charges he denied - over the sinking of a barge he was operating.   He moved there after serving several years in jail, the former officer said.   Viktor declined to talk about his past.   Nowadays, he lives on fresh fish, berries and mushrooms, and refuses to use medicine. He fell gravely ill last year from a tick bite, he says, but recovered by praying with his ceramic cross and eating hand-picked herbs.   In winter, he braves icy climes by heating his hut using a gas cylinder. When the seasons change, he feels himself physically rejuvenate along with the wildlife around him, he says.   He sometimes comes into contact with people when they sail past on boats or stop to buy fish. Viktor himself very occasionally leaves his seclusion, crossing the two-kilometer-wide river to buy cigarettes.

In an era when your most health-conscious friend may just as likely be paleo as vegan, the truth is we're all just eating on a whim and a prayer. Even our governments are flip-flopping on dietary recommendations, one decade telling us to cut fat and eat carbs, the next decade saying, oops, carbs and sugar are the devil himself. Similarly, when a recent report suggested that eating more fat could actually help people cut their risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, the chief nutritionist of Public Health England called the advice ""irresponsible and potentially deadly."" Talk about fighting words. The National Obesity Forum, which published the report, does not appear to be backing down. They say that the low-fat food craze of the 80s and thereafter has had ""disastrous health consequences"" on the nation and should be nixed. Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a senior adviser to the organization, said: ""The change in dietary advice to promote low-fat foods is perhaps the biggest mistake in modern medical history."" Here's his advice, and the advice of the new report: ""Eat fat to get slim, don't fear fat, fat is your friend."" This low-fat versus pro-fat battle is becoming the British equivalent of dueling banjos. Dr. Alison Tedstone, of Public Health England (the anti-fat coalition, in case you're losing track) responded by saying the following: ""In the face of all the evidence, calling for people to eat more fat, cut out carbs, and ignore calories is irresponsible."" She says she can cite ""thousands of scientific studies"" that say low-fat is the way to go, whereas the National Obesity Forum only cited 43 in their new report. The Royal Society for Public Health jumped on the anti-fat bandwagon and said the new report was a ""muddled manifesto of sweeping statements, generalizations and speculation."" So what does the report recommend? Simply to avoid processed foods labeled ""low-fat,"" ""lite,"" ""low-cholesterol"" or ""proven to lower cholesterol."" Avoid sugar and refined carbs. Forget about calorie-counting. Exercise won't override your lousy diet. And good fats are good for you. Who will be victorious in the fat-versus-low-fat battles? Only time will tell. In the meantime, we'll all just have to continue eating whatever the hell suits our whim at the moment.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8qeeab/once-again-everything-you-knew-about-high-fat-diets-is-wrong,Food by VICE ,Vice
291,291,29-06-19 00:00,2019,6,29,,Sweden upset Germany to reach World Cup semis,"RENNES, France (Reuters) - Sweden ended Germany’s hopes of a third women’s World Cup win, coming from behind for a surprise 2-1 quarter-final victory on Saturday thanks to goals from Sofia Jakobsson and Stina Blackstenius.  The Swedes now face a last-four clash with the Netherlands in Lyon on Wednesday after a win which means Olympic champions Germany will not have a chance to defend their title in Tokyo next year.  It was sweet revenge for the Swedes, who had lost the Olympic final to the Germans 2-1 in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 but who have now booked a place at their old rivals’ expense in the 2020 Games.  Many will still look to the other semi-final, Tuesday’s clash between England and the United States, for the likely winner of the tournament but the Swedes showed they should not be under-estimated with their swift counter-attacking style.  Germany began brightly and took the lead in the 16th minute through Lina Magull, who twisted her body perfectly to beat Hedvig Lindahl with a hooked volley.  Germany had not conceded a single goal in the tournament but their defense surprisingly failed to deal with a long ball down the middle from Linda Sembrant which Jakobsson latched onto and slotted home past goalkeeper Almuth Schult.  At the break, Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg threw on midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who had not played since breaking a toe in their tournament opener against China, looking to add some much-needed creativity.  Instead, just three minutes after the resumption, it was the Swedes who struck again.  Schult did well to turn away a powerful header by Fridolina Rolfo but the rebound fell kindly to striker Blackstenius, who fired home from point blank range for her second goal in as many matches.  Substitute Lena Oberdorf missed a great chance to force the game into extra time when she headed wide with the goal gaping in the 80th minute but Sweden held their nerve to reach their fourth World Cup semi-finals.  “We looked at Germany and knew there would be a bit more space behind their backline to exploit with Blackstenius and Jakobsson. It worked well, sprinting past the defensive line,” said Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson.  “We’ve talked about the possibilities here to go far and win every game. A good sign is that we’re now qualified for the Olympics, which was hanging over our heads for a while. Now we don’t have to worry about it. There’s not a single cell in us that’s content with this. We’re going to go for it.”  There were tears on the faces of many of the Germany squad as the reality of their exit — and Olympic absence - hit home hard.  “We wanted to do so much more. This should not happen like it did,” said Magull.  “We had one, two good chances to equalize but did not manage it. That’s a real shame. We knew they had fast players and wanted to defend high up the pitch,” she said.  “That brings the danger of conceding on the counter, which had happened before the break.”  The win was Sweden’s first over Germany at a major tournament since 1995, having previously come close in the 2003 World Cup final and in the 2016 Rio final.  Sweden’s semi-final opponents were confirmed earlier in the day when Netherlands defeated Italy 2-0 in Valenciennes, courtesy of second-half headers from Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt.  Netherlands, Sweden, along with Britain — after England reached the last four on Thursday — have qualified for the 2020 Olympics as the top three European teams at the World Cup.

292,292,04-03-16 21:20,2016,3,4,Brian Resnick,Why Scott Kelly’s return to Earth is like an epic bad hangover,"After a year in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly returned to Earth a changed man. For one, he emerged from the Soyuz landing capsule Tuesday around 1.5 inches taller than he was before the mission. (In microgravity, the spine decompresses and extends.) And, at first, he felt great, Kelly said at a NASA press conference on Friday. But then, gravity started tugging on his body. ""I'm surprised how I do feel different physically than I did the last time,"" Kelly told reporters, comparing this latest re-entry to his previous six-month mission in 2010. His description of the experience since landing sounds like an epically bad hangover. Every muscle hurts. His skin even hurts. And he just can't perform at his best. (Though he made no mention of a headache.) Kelly explained: Initially, this time, coming out of the capsule, I felt better than last time. But at some point those two lines have crossed. My level of muscle soreness and fatigue is a lot higher than it was last time. It makes me think there a linear function to it [meaning the more time you spend in space, the worse you will feel when you return.] Also, my skin, because it hasn't touched anything for so long ... it's very, very sensitive. It's like a burning feeling wherever I sit or lie or walk. Later in the press conference, Kelly explained he tried to shoot some hoops after returning to the ground. ""I didn't get any of them in the net,"" he said. ""Not like I'm a good basketball player generally."" NASA sent Kelly on the year-long mission to study whether a year in space would take a greater toll on his body than the typical six-month mission. They won't actually know for a while: It will take at least a year for Kelly's data to be analyzed, NASA scientists said. But anecdotally, the man himself says it was tougher both physically and psychologically. With six months, he said, ""you can see the end."" With the year trip, he said, it felt like he lived on the space station forever. ""The hardest part is being isolated in a physical sense from the people on the ground that are important to you,"" Kelly said during a previous press conference aboard the space station. ""There's a loss of connection with folks on the ground that you care for and love and you want to spend time with, which is a challenge."" NASA will have to address these concerns during a Mars mission, where a round trip journey would last a year or more. And while Kelly did say he grew an inch and a half in space, (possibly giving him a height advantage over his twin Mark for the first time in his life) he knows that benefit will disappear quickly. ""Gravity pushes you back down to size,"" he says.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/4/11162618/scott-kelly-height,,Vox
293,293,06-07-16 15:00,2016,7,6,Emily Guendelsberger,What I Learned About Arranged Marriage from My Indian In-Laws,"In the house my husband Rajiv and I share, there's a wall dedicated to old family photos. My favorite is one of Rajiv's dad as a young doctor in California, in which he's wearing a plaid suit, polka-dot shirt, paisley tie, and a giant goofy grin. The outfit is eye-searing even in black-and-white, and could only exist in the 1970s. For aesthetic continuity, I hung the photo next to my parents' wedding photo, in which my dad is wearing a similarly blinding plaid suit.  Below that photo is Rajiv's parents' wedding photo, a black-and-white shot around the same time as the other two—even though it looks like it could've been taken during any year in the 20th century. The bride and groom are done up in full traditional Indian wedding gear, with garlands of flowers and tons of jewelry.  It was one hell of a second date.I'd known that Rajiv's parents had entered into an arranged marriage, and I'd always been curious about how the arranged marriage worked. I didn't ask them about it for years, though, as it took me a while to get to the point where I could even have normal conversations with them.  I first met Rajiv's parents when I flew across the country to stay at their house for two weeks. It was not the most relaxing vacation I've taken. Rajiv's a born-and-raised, surf-shop-loving California sk8er boi; his parents, who emigrated from South India in the 70s, both have doctorate degrees and share a Newport Beach house roughly five times the size of the one I grew up in. Until we got married a few years ago, when we visited I stayed in a guest room much larger than my childhood living room.I desperately wanted to impress them, especially since Rajiv and I had just moved in together after a year of dating. So my first visit with Rajiv's parents was tense as a coiled spring, as I was ready at any moment to demonstrate what an excellent partner I was for their son. It was exhausting, but as I decompressed on the plane ride home, I high-fived myself for not breaking character for two whole weeks. I was pretty sure I'd crushed it.  Then, a few days later, Rajiv called me at work. He'd just gotten an email from his mom saying we shouldn't move in together because we were ""fundamentally incompatible.""  He was furious, which was pretty uncommon for him; he said he'd told her to butt out, and that this wouldn't affect our plans to move in together. I guess he just needed to share his outrage with someone, but while I tried to prevent myself from crying in front of my co-workers, I told him never to tell me about things like this in the future.  But the phrase ""fundamentally incompatible"" was already burned into my brain. I got the details, and they weren't what I'd expected: Specifically, his mom said I was too messy for him.  This is true: I am a mess, and Rajiv is very clean. During the two weeks staying in his parents' guest bedroom, I lived out of my suitcase, piling dirty and clean clothes on the floor and most likely leaving some non-organic trash lying around. I didn't think anyone would see the mess, and I honestly don't remember it being that bad—but then, my messiness means I have a pretty high bar for a mess to qualify as ""memorable.""  However, I'd long suspected I wasn't good enough for Rajiv—to a degree, I still do—and his mother uttering ""fundamentally incompatible"" confirmed this for me. Regardless, Rajiv and I moved in together, and we were happy. Whenever we visited California, though, I was even more tense and on edge than I had been during the first visit. I never mentioned the email, and I was pretty sure his mom didn't know I knew about it. I became even more obsessed with demonstrating my perfect compatibility with their son.  Let me be clear: Rajiv's parents have never been anything but lovely and welcoming to me in person. After we moved in together, Rajiv's mom told me that they thought of me as one of the family, and that as a result, she wanted me to start calling them Aunty and Uncle (which is how South Indians refer to older relatives). After a few years, their unremitting kindness wore me down, and ""fundamentally incompatible"" stopped circling around my head. After nine years together and three years of marriage, I finally feel at home with Rajiv's family. Aunty and I text silly photos back-and-forth like I do with my own mom, and we have normal conversations instead of my feeling like I have to perform for them.  A few years ago, when we visited California while Rajiv and I were planning our wedding, I asked Aunty how she and Uncle had met. Her story made me wish I'd asked years ago, because it cast ""fundamentally incompatible"" in a different context and took the sting out of the phrase.  ""Uncle's family and my family have a common friend,"" Aunty said. ""As it usually happens in India, the friend said, 'Hey, you both have marriage-aged children who might make good partners.'  At the time, Aunty was 22, working in Bombay as a psychologist and about to start a PhD program. So she told her parents that if they wanted her to get married, they'd better set something up now: ""If I started the program, I wasn't going to move anywhere until I finished.""  Uncle didn't want to get married while he was in medical school, but when he finished, he asked his parents to find him a wife. He had just opened his practice in California. ""His mom was worried sick he'd marry a white girl!"" Aunty laughed.  So Uncle took three weeks off work and flew back home to meet a series of girls his parents thought might be a good match. At the mutual family friend's suggestion, Aunty flew across the country to meet him. They spent a day getting to know each other, and they spoke in English, as their two states had different languages.  ""I told him, 'I don't like to cook and clean, and I want a career, so don't expect me to be a stay-at-home wife.' He said his job as a doctor meant unpredictable hours, and that he'd sometimes have to leave in the middle of the night if there was an emergency. Then we went out to dinner with our fathers. We decided it would work out, and then a week later, we got married—and it's been working out for forty years!""  How could two people possibly decide whether to spend their whole lives together based on one date? Uncle had already gone on several of these interview-dates and hadn't liked any of them; this was Aunty's third. She says that she just liked him in a way that she hadn't felt about the other two. ""It's a gut instinct—like, OK, he would be compatible with me. He had a sense of humor, which was important for me. I was twenty-two and very young. That's the thing about arranged marriages—you're pretty much marrying a stranger.""  In India, entering a relationship with someone is more cognitive than it is emotional, so according to Aunty, ""I like you"" is only part of it. ""What makes a relationship work is compatibility—similar values and belief systems. You can't sustain romantic love. Sooner or later, it turns into companionship, respect, things like that. The romantic kind of love is fleeting."" She said that many of her classmates in India had marriages based solely on love, but for her, an arrangement based on compatibility of those traits seemed much more pragmatic.  A few years later, that conversation with Aunty stands out at me when I notice how many of the questions in advice columns boil down to ""I want X and my partner doesn't and we got married anyway—so how do I make my partner want X?"" Americans seem to be terrible at choosing partners we're compatible with in a long-term sense. Like Aunty said, they marry based on romantic love and physical attraction, and roughly half of those marriages fizzle out in divorce. Aunty and Uncle married as strangers, but the initial awkwardness of the situation matured into one of most genuinely happy marriages I've witnessed. Keeping in mind that there's other factors involved, the divorce rate in India is around one percent, and I sometimes wonder what direction America's gross domestic happiness would head if arranged marriages were more common.  Before I began dating Rajiv, I harbored biases I didn't realize I had. As a child, I read books in which a plucky heroine escaped from an arranged marriage, and I've read a reasonable amount of adult-focused fiction that addresses the subject as well. Along the way, I developed an (incorrect) understanding that the power dynamic in arranged marriages was inherently oppressive for women because it didn't allow them to make their own choices. I'd personally hate for my parents to make that sort of decision for me, so I assumed that others wouldn't be thrilled either.  Obviously, though, I wasn't raised in a culture where that was the norm. I was raised to believe that the Western way of finding a partner was the only way to find happiness, and after meeting Rajiv's parents as well as other relatives who had arranged marriages, it's clear that's not true. From Aunty's point of view, arranged marriage is just more rational, and now that I'm able to see it from her point of view, finding a partner purely through romantic means seems more illogical—especially as I notice incompatibilities in my own relationship and the relationships of those around me. I still wouldn't want an arranged marriage, but I no longer think the Western way of doing things is better, either.  Recently, I mustered the courage to ask Aunty about Rajiv and me being ""fundamentally incompatible."" I was right—she hadn't known that Rajiv had told me, and she offered to explain why she said that. ""When we met your parents, we felt like we were friends from a long time ago—we shared the same values,"" she said ""Your work ethic, your values, your moral character—they match! The rest of it is individual stuff, and ultimately, these things are fixable. What I was saying to Rajiv was 'Think this through'—that's all. 'Go in with your eyes open.'""  I do sometimes wonder if Rajiv would be happier if he'd been matched with someone who didn't forget to scoop the cat box, or leave old cups of coffee around the house like moldy Easter eggs. But we both went in with our eyes open.  Follow Emily Guendelsberger on Twitter. ",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nn98x7/what-i-learned-about-arranged-marriage-from-my-indian-in-laws,Sex,Vice
294,294,17-04-18 00:00,2018,4,17,Elias Glenn,China posts strong growth despite trade concerns,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by strong consumer demand and robust property investment.   Resilience in the world’s second-largest economy will likely keep a synchronized global recovery on track for a while longer, even as China faces rising tensions with the United States that could impact billions of dollars in trade.   But economists still expect China to lose momentum in coming quarters as Beijing forces local governments to scale back infrastructure projects to contain their debt, and as property sales cool further due to strict government controls on purchases to fight speculation.      Consumption, which accounted for almost 80 percent of economic growth in the first quarter, played a significant role in supporting the economy even as risks grew for Chinese exporters.  March retail sales rose 10.1 percent from a year earlier, slightly more than expected and the strongest pace in four months, with consumers buying more of almost everything from cosmetics to furniture and home appliances.  “The retail sales data tells you a lot about consumption. It is not seasonal - if you look at growth in cosmetics, spending on clothing, spending on automobiles, there has been a persistent trend for a few months,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.   “Consumption is really strong, there is strong wage growth in urban areas. We underestimated the power of consumption in China.”  China’s export sector also posted solid growth in the first quarter, with shipments to the U.S. jumping 14.8 percent on-year. Some analysts have speculated Chinese firms may have rushed out deliveries to the U.S. as tariff threats loomed.  However, net exports overall were a drag on GDP growth in the quarter after giving an added boost to the economy last year, highlighting the need for sustained strength in domestic demand if significant new tariffs are imposed.      “We don’t expect (the U.S.-China tensions) will evolve into a full-scale trade war, but we also argue this uncertainty will not disappear and we expect a bumpy road of negotiations. In terms of the impact of potential tariffs, it is pretty limited, particularly this year,” said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.   “Even in the worst scenario that both countries start to implement the $50 billion tariffs, we’re talking about a few tenths of a percentage point and most likely it will only start to affect the economy late this year and in 2019.”  CRACKDOWNS ON FINANCIAL RISKS, POLLUTION TO CONTINUE          Analysts polled by Reuters had expected January-March GDP to grow 6.7 percent from a year earlier, slowing marginally from the pace in late 2017.  China’s GDP has now grown 6.8 percent for three straight quarters, a remarkably steady pace for such a large and dynamic economy and reinforcing concerns about the reliability of official data.  On a quarterly seasonally adjusted basis, GDP grew 1.4 percent, slightly less than expected and easing from 1.6 percent in October-December, again suggesting the economy may be losing some steam.  Still, growth remained comfortably above the government’s target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, giving policymakers room to further reduce risks in China’s financial system and rein in pollution without stalling economic growth.   Authorities have repeated pledged to reduce a mountain of corporate debt in the name of national security, though they have moved cautiously to avoid stunting business activity.   Beijing has also stuck to its campaign of shuttering heavily polluting factories as it tries to encourage more sustainable and higher quality growth from “new economy” sectors such as technology.   Smokestack industries have been a key focus of that pivot in industrial policy, even though it is weighing on China’s overall manufacturing outlook.   Industrial output expanded 6.0 percent in March on-year, the slowest pace in seven months. Analysts had predicted output growth would cool to 6.2 percent from 7.2 percent in the first two months of the year.   “Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore.  “The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors.”  First-quarter readings on China’s property sector, a key economic driver, were mixed but also appeared to reflect the growing influence of changing government policies.  Real estate investment accelerated to 10.4 percent in the  quarter - the fastest pace in three years - compared with a 9.9 percent rise in the first two months of this year.  Analysts say a significant rise in land prices, as well as a government push to build more public housing, could have contributed to the unexpected strength in the headline figure and a jump in construction starts.  Property sales, however, continued to slow amid a flurry of government measures to get soaring home prices under control and rising mortgage rates. Sales by floor area rose 3.6 percent in the quarter, easing from earlier in the year.  Fixed-asset investment has also faltered as Beijing urges local governments to refrain from rampant borrowing to finance glamour projects to beat economic growth targets.   January-March fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 7.5 percent, below expectations and 7.9 percent in January-February.  Infrastructure investment rose 13 percent on-year, easing slightly from January-February.  In one surprise shift, private investment - which accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China - grew faster than state firms’ investment for the first time in over two years.  Private-sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.9 percent in January-March, accelerating from an increase of 8.1 percent in the first two months.  “The pickup in private investment this year is mainly the result of improving corporate profits from last year and government policy support. Bank lending at the start of the year also helped,” David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist at ANZ.   Despite a more upbeat first quarter than expected, analysts still predict China’s economic growth will slow to 6.5 percent this year, with the ongoing regulatory crackdown and U.S. trade dispute seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.[ECILT/CN]  Reporting by Elias Glenn; Additional reporting by Yawen Chen and Stella Qiu in BEIJING and Marius Zaharia in HONG KONG; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Kim Coghill",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/china-posts-strong-growth-despite-trade-concerns-idUSKBN1HO06S,Business News,Reuters

296,296,24-07-18 15:00,2018,7,24,Emily Stewart,"Trump tweets, “Tariffs are the greatest!” Experts say they’re not.","President Donald Trump is taking his trade war pitch to the people. His message: “Tariffs are the greatest!” Except they’re not — and even his chief economic adviser has said so. In a tweet early Tuesday morning, the president sought to reassure Americans that the tariffs he’s imposed on China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan are a good idea. His administration has targeted steel and aluminum imports from many American allies, put tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, and is looking to escalate by potentially increasing China tariffs and imposing a tax on imported cars and parts. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, policy experts, and business groups are urging Trump to put on the brakes, but he appears to be moving full speed ahead. “Tariffs are the greatest,” he tweeted on Tuesday. “Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s a simple as that — and everybody’s talking!” He reassured Americans that “all will be Great,” despite the growing concerns about his tactics. Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. All will be Great! Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Trump appeared similarly emboldened and brushed aside concerns about the consequences of his trade tactics. He suggested that now is the time to launch trade aggressions because the stock market is up. “You know the expression, ‘We’re playing with the bank’s money,’ right?” Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services. They’re meant to raise revenue or protect domestic industries from foreign competition, but they often result in higher prices for businesses that rely on the imported goods — say, manufacturers that use steel and aluminum imports in their supply chain — and, ultimately, for consumers when companies pass on the extra prices to them. Trump is enacting tariffs in an effort to extract demands from foreign countries, though in most cases, experts say it’s not clear what he wants. There is a chorus of voices warning against the potential consequences of a trade war, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow — at least before he worked for Trump. In a March op-ed, Kudlow warned Trump that tariffs are likely to backfire and argued that they’re really tax hikes. Referring specifically to the steel and aluminum tariffs, Kudlow wrote, “Since so many of the things American consumers buy today are made of steel or aluminum, a 25 percent tariff will likely get passed on to consumers at the cash register. This is a regressive tax on low-income families.” .@POTUS this morning: ""Tariffs are the greatest!""His current chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow wrote a joint op-ed in March explaining to @POTUS why ""tariff hikes are really tax hikes"" that ""almost always deliver an unhappy ending."" https://t.co/5jA3qSsT7o https://t.co/ddZcuPq3Tw Thus far, the effects of Trump’s trade war have been limited. Specific companies have seen consequences — for example, Harley-Davidson and Mid-Continent Nail — as have industries such as agriculture and home appliances. There have also been warnings that Trump’s tariffs could wipe out any positive effects of the tax cuts the GOP passed in 2017. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that Trump’s enacted and proposed tariffs completely reverse the tax bill’s positive effects on the labor force. It estimates the tariffs enacted so far will reduce wages by 0.04 percent and eliminate more than 48,000 jobs. If the White House enacts every tariff it’s threatened, it would reduce wages by 0.26 percent and slash 277,000 jobs. In other words, tariffs aren’t as “great” as Trump wants everyone to think. And just because the stock market is up (it’s gained significantly since Trump’s inauguration but is actually relatively flat this year) and the economy is good doesn’t mean Trump has “play money” to work with. Mark Zandi, the chief economist with Moody’s Analytics, in an email weighed in on Trump’s assertion that things are so good right now that it’s time to get aggressive on trade. The president’s view is “deeply vexed,” Zandi said. “The economy is strong, but only because it is being temporarily juiced up by deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. He is borrowing money to pay for the trade war. Ironically, he is borrowing the money in part from the very countries he is fighting with (e.g., China, Japan, Canada, Europe).” The United States’ trading partners don’t appear to be backing down; instead, they’ve hit the US with retaliatory tariffs. The rhetoric isn’t cooling down either, with Trump declaring Europe one of America’s biggest “foes” just this month. The trade war “will almost certainly diminish the US position as the center of the global economy and financial system,” Zandi said. “Trump’s trade war may become his Vietnam if he doesn’t rethink things soon.”",https://www.vox.com/2018/7/24/17607182/trump-tariffs-trade-war-tax-china,,Vox

With two conservative justices dissenting, the court refused to temporarily exempt from the ban a group of plaintiffs including the Firearms Policy Foundation while their legal challenge continues to be litigated in Washington.  The Supreme Court twice previously rejected requests by gun rights advocates - in the case in the U.S. capital and a similar one in Michigan - to temporarily block the ban while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.  The ban, which went into effect on March 26, was embraced by Trump following a 2017 massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58 people in which the gunman used bump stocks.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had temporarily blocked the ban’s enforcement against the specific challengers in the litigation it was handling, but on April 1 ruled in the administration’s favor and refused to lift the ban.   The challengers then returned to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the policy from applying specifically to them. In Friday’s order, Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the request to exempt the challengers.  Bump stocks use a gun’s recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform it into a machine gun.  The ban requires owners to turn in or destroy the attachments. People caught in possession of them could face up to 10 years in prison. The ban represents a rare recent instance of gun control at the federal level in a country that has experienced a series of mass shootings.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Despite newly-publicized allegations that Michael Jackson repeatedly molested children, a blockbuster art exhibition celebrating the singer will continue its world tour. A spokesperson for the Bundekunsthalle in Bonn, Germany told Hyperallergic over email that the museum has no plans to cancel Michael Jackson: On the Wall, although the institution is closely monitoring discussions surrounding the recently-released HBO documentary, Leaving Neverland. The exhibition, which examines the musician’s influence on contemporary art, first opened at London’s National Portrait Gallery last summer before traveling to the Grand Palais in Paris. Currently, On the Wall is scheduled to open in Bonn for a four-month run starting on March 22 before heading toward Finland in August. The show contains works by 40 artists including Andy Warhol, David Hammons, Paul McCarthy, Isa Genzken, Kehinde Wiley, and Jordan Wolfson. While the exhibition was developed by NPG in cooperation with the musician’s estate, the Leaving Neverland documentary released without the Jackson family’s approval. In fact, the pop star’s estate is suing HBO for potentially more than $100 million, in part because the film’s director, Dan Reed, never requested their comment. When Jackson died in 2009, he had fought against multiple allegations of child sexual abuse for over 15 years. Leaving Neverland details the separate accounts of two men, now in their 30s, who say the celebrity began long-running relationships with them when they were just 7 and 10 years old. The four-hour documentary describes in detail how Jackson allegedly manipulated those around him to gain access to young boys. Stories within the film include the star’s secret system of bells to warn of approaching adults; a mock wedding ceremony with a child and studded diamond ring; a series of slumber parties that turned into sex; and unaware parents who were ecstatic to be guests at Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. “The allegations made in the film are shocking,” the museum said in a statement originally written in German, “the lawsuit, however, has not been resolved and since Michael Jackson’s death [these allegations] have been considerably more difficult to prove.” The exhibition’s curatorial thesis seems tailored to anticipate and avoid confronting the singer’s history of child sexual abuse allegations.

300,300,24-07-18 20:20,2018,7,24,Johana Bhuiyan,"Months after a self-driving crash, Uber is being slower and more deliberate as it gets back on public roads to test its technology ","“Slow,” “steady” and “deliberate” are rarely used when describing Uber. But months after an Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode fatally crashed into a pedestrian, the company has had no choice but to move carefully. After pulling all of its self-driving cars off public roads, laying off all the vehicle operators in Pittsburgh and San Francisco and shutting down its Arizona self-driving operation, Uber is very gradually beginning to prepare to start testing self-driving cars again. That starts with manually driving its fleet of Volvo XC90s in Pittsburgh to map out the streets. Mapping out city streets is essentially square one for testing self-driving cars — that’s a tough spot to be in as a company with serious ambitions for developing autonomous technology, especially in the face of massive competition. But Uber has to move slowly to regain the trust of not just the public, but also city and local governments. This gradual start in Pittsburgh also gives Uber time to implement some of the safety features and changes recommended by an internal team of experts that conducted a review of the company’s self-driving development and operation. Those changes may seem small individually, but together they point to a significant change in how Uber is thinking about self-driving. While much of the inception and some of the way in which the company later operated its self-driving efforts was fueled by competition — specifically with Google parent company Alphabet — the company is now introducing features and technology that prioritize safety. Specifically, Uber is going back to having two people in each car, and will be monitoring its safety drivers — the people who are designated to take over control of the car as needed — in real time. It’s not common for autonomous test cars to be driven with just one person behind the wheel so early in the technology’s development. But around November 2017, Uber switched two safety drivers to one for many of its cars, in part to increase the number of miles each car was driven in autonomous mode, sources told Recode. Miles driven autonomously is just one of many barometers for how advanced a company’s technology is and is how the software driving the cars learns and gains more experience. An Uber spokesperson said that the company decided to make the transition from two drivers to one because the company felt that the role of the second operator — which was to gather information about how well the car was driving itself — could be done after the fact and didn’t have to be done in real time. A byproduct of that, however, is drivers were left alone to determine when to take over control over the car as needed, and there was no one there to ensure they were not distracted. Add to that, the company’s in-car camera system did not detect when a driver was distracted — it simply recorded the driver. That means in order to see whether a driver was distracted at any point in time, a manager had to manually go through the footage after the fact. While sources say that was inefficient in and of itself, it was also exacerbated by how quickly Uber was hiring safety drivers. In Arizona, some managers were in charge of about 25 people, one source said, making it difficult to spot-check whether anyone had unsafe driving behaviors. That said, if a driver was caught doing something unsafe, the company typically had a one-strike policy, sources said. This new off-the-shelf camera system Uber is integrating will instead detect distracted driving in real time, log it into the system automatically, and then make a noise to alert the driver to pay attention. (Similar to a system that startup Nauto has built.) So managers will simply have to look at the software or platform to see all the instances of a driver being distracted. While an Uber spokesperson said the company was being more deliberate about the ratio of managers to vehicle operators — the company is filling about 55 roles for what it calls “mission specialists” — this new real-time alert system will help alleviate some of the difficulty of auditing driving behavior manually. That’s hugely important. A closer investigation of the fatal crash that took the life of Elaine Herzberg in Arizona revealed that Uber relied heavily on the humans sitting behind the wheel to react immediately in an emergency. And in this case the driver was distracted. In fact, it was later revealed that the driver was streaming a show on her phone while sitting behind the wheel. That’s the risk with depending on a human driver — they become too reliant on the automated technology to drive itself safely and, in turn, get distracted. To that end, Uber is also ensuring that the automatic emergency braking system that is already built into the car will be engaged no matter when it is being driven. Have more information or any tips?

You can also find her on Twitter at @JmBooyah. These changes come to Uber as the competition for being one of the first companies with a network of self-driving cars — an important feat both technologically and financially — becomes steeper. From a pure miles-driven standpoint, Alphabet’s Waymo announced it had autonomously driven more than eight million miles on public roads just last week. At last count, Uber had only reached three million miles before it halted all of its self-driving testing in March. While the company doesn’t have to start entirely from scratch once it does start testing its autonomous technology again, Uber was struggling to meet internal goals in the lead up to the crash. As we first reported, Uber’s fleet of vehicles could only drive less than a mile before a safety driver had to take over in March 2017. As of March 2018, the company was still struggling to meet its goal of driving 13 miles without a driver taking over. While it was a meager increase from the year prior, it was still far lower than its competitors like Waymo, which said it drove an average of 5,600 miles before a driver had to take over control in 2017. At the core of this issue is safety. Companies building self-driving cars pitch it as a potentially life-saving technology, but those companies still have a lot to prove. That’s especially true as the U.S. Congress actively works to regulate autonomous technology.

301,301,04-10-16 12:40,2016,10,4,Jennifer Williams,"The stunning collapse of Colombia’s peace agreement with the FARC, explained","On Sunday, Colombian voters narrowly rejected the government’s peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in a stunning referendum vote that has thrown the peace process into disarray. The deal between the Colombian government and the Marxist rebel group was reached on August 24 after four long years of fraught negotiations. And just last Monday, it was signed by President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Timoleon “Timochenko” Jimenez. All that was left was for voters to approve it in a nationwide referendum on Sunday. Most observers saw the vote as a mere formality that would officially bring an end to the 52-year war that left 220,000 people dead and displaced millions. Although there was significant public opposition to the deal, nearly every poll predicted that it would be approved by the people with a comfortable margin. But in what one UK pollster called “one of the biggest polling fails of all time,” the peace deal was narrowly rejected, with 50.2 percent voting against it. That means the peace agreement can’t be implemented — and is effectively dead. So what happened? And what happens now? Here’s a brief explainer on what Colombia is facing this week. The FARC is the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). It’s a Marxist rebel group that since 1964 has waged a bloody rebellion against the Colombian government — and it’s the longest-running armed insurgency in the Western Hemisphere. As Amanda Taub explained for Vox in 2014: In the early 1960s, the FARC and other leftist guerrilla groups formed as a rural insurgency that claimed to represent the interests of Colombia's poor against the landed elite. The elite responded by organizing private ""self-defense"" organizations to oppose the rebels, which soon transformed into right-wing paramilitary groups. That became the civil war that has lasted ever since, albeit in sometimes very different forms. Since 1964, the FARC, fueled by revenue from the Colombian drug trade, engaged in a guerrilla war primarily against the Colombian security forces. FARC rebels attacked police stations and military posts, ambushed security patrols, hijacked airplanes, and carried out assassinations. They also targeted critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines and bridges, and even bombed social clubs. Many of their victims have been civilians, including children. Thousands of people have been maimed by FARC land mines, and thousands more were kidnapped and held for ransom. Child soldier recruitment and sexual violence were also common. Starting in 2000, the United States began providing the Colombian government with billions of dollars in mostly military aid to help interrupt the country’s massive drug trade and fight the FARC and other smaller rebel groups. The hope was that social and economic conditions in Colombia’s “historically marginalized” rural areas in which the armed groups thrive would also be improved. Under the agreement, called Plan Colombia, the US pledged nearly $10 billion in assistance. As reported by the Washington Post’s Dana Priest, this was paired with “a CIA covert action program that has helped Colombian forces kill at least two dozen rebel leaders.” As far as the FARC is concerned, at least, the plan seems to have worked. (Its impact on the drug trade, on the other hand, is less clear.) The group suffered massive losses, including the deaths of several high-profile leaders. “In 2008, senior rebel leader Raul Reyes was killed in a bombing raid and FARC founder Manuel Marulanda died of natural causes,” the BBC reports. “In 2011, Alfonso Cano, who took over from Manuel Marulanda, was also killed in a bombing raid.” This concerted effort severely weakened the organization: In 2002, the group was estimated to have some 20,000 active fighters; current estimates put that number at somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000 active fighters, with another 8,500 civilians who make up the FARC's support network. In response, the group entered into secret negotiations with the government starting in 2010, and two years later entered into formal negotiations. Finally, in a ceremony on September 26, attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, US Secretary of State John Kerry, and a dozen Latin American leaders, Colombian President Santos and FARC leader Timochenko signed the historic peace agreement. Under the 297-page agreement, the FARC’s fighters would have disarmed, handing over weapons to United Nations inspectors, and become a legal political party with 10 guaranteed seats in the country’s Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. The deal would also have allowed rebels to avoid jail time if they confessed to their crimes. Per the BBC, the agreement would have created “a special legal framework” intended “to try those who committed crimes during the armed conflict, including Farc fighters, government soldiers and members of right-wing paramilitary groups.” “Those who confessed to crimes” would “not serve prison sentences, but [would instead] take part in acts of ‘reparation,’ including clearing land mines, repairing damaged infrastructure, and helping victims,” the BBC reported. Fighters who demobilized would also receive financial aid from the Colombian government to help them reintegrate into civil society. In the runup to the vote, FARC leaders also offered public apologies to their victims and pledged to publicly disclose all of their financial assets and pay reparations. ""We will proceed to declare before the government all the monetary and non-monetary resources that have formed part of our war economy,” the group said. ""We will proceed to the material reparations of victims."" For its part, the government pledged under the peace agreement to invest substantial resources in improving the country’s rural areas, something the rebels have long been fighting for. According to the Washington Post’s Abbey Steele, measures include providing “development assistance to small-share landholders, who now have trouble getting formal titles to the land they’ve been farming and getting their crops into markets” and offering “rural investments and legal crops so that farmers have fewer incentives to grow illegal crops.” The public’s main objection to the agreement was that it was far too lenient on the FARC fighters, whose war against the Colombian government has ravaged the country for more than half a century. One Colombian woman told BBC Mundo that Colombians still associated the FARC with “kidnappings, killings and drug trafficking.” The leading voice of opposition to the peace deal is former President Alvaro Uribe, who is widely credited with having achieved the military gains that forced the rebels to the negotiating table in the first place. “They will spend zero days in prison; they will be awarded with political representation,” Paloma Valencia, a senator in Uribe’s party, was quoted as saying of the rebels. “This deal breaks the rule of law.” Uribe claims he is not opposed to peace in principle but that he wants to renegotiate the agreement, which he says needs ""corrections."" These include barring those found guilty of having committed crimes from running for public office, making FARC leaders serve time in prison for crimes they committed, and forcing the FARC to pay compensation to victims. According to the BBC, opponents of the deal also feared that allowing former FARC members to participate in the country’s political process as a legitimate political party could open the door to disastrous radical left-wing policies like those in Cuba and Venezuela: They have dubbed this threat ""Castro-Chavismo"" after the Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. They point to the fact that the Cuban government hosted the peace talks and Venezuela acted as a facilitator as evidence of the influence these two left-wing governments had on the negotiations. They have accused President Santos of ""selling the country out"" and warn that with the rebels becoming political players, Colombia could soon resemble Cuba and Venezuela and suffer from the same shortages these countries are experiencing. Finally, some opponents of the peace deal simply didn’t believe that the FARC was sincere in its intentions to lay down arms and make peace with the government. The peace agreement as written cannot be implemented without an approval by referendum, so it will have to be renegotiated. President Santos has promised to “continue the search for peace until the last moment of my mandate, because that's the way to leave a better country to our children ... I won't give up,” he said. Speaking to journalists in Havana after Sunday's referendum results, Timochenko said that his group remains committed to ending the conflict. The rebel leader said he regrets that what he called ""the destructive power of those who sow hatred and rancor [has] influenced the opinion of the Colombian population.” He promised that the group will keep working to build a stable peace: “Count on us, peace will triumph.” However, before the vote, Santos told the BBC that there was ""no Plan B"" for ending the conflict if the referendum on the peace agreement failed. He has reportedly told his negotiators to travel to Cuba to consult with FARC leaders on what the next move will be. Fernando Giraldo, a political analyst, told the Guardian that the fact that both the government and guerrillas reiterated their commitment to peace was a good sign but the future was unclear. “The plebiscite laid everything out in black and white and now we’re stuck in a grey area,” he said.",https://www.vox.com/world/2016/10/4/13147194/colombia-farc-peace-deal-referendum-vote-defeat,,Vox

305,305,23-05-17 20:25,2017,5,23,German Lopez,Trump’s budget makes it official: he’s doing little to nothing about the opioid epidemic,"Tens of thousands of people will likely die of drug overdoses under President Donald Trump’s watch, as America’s horrific opioid epidemic continues. Yet with his first big policy document — the 2018 budget proposal — Trump is proving that he’ll do little to nothing about the crisis. If anything, Trump’s proposal could make the opioid epidemic worse. Where the budget does anything of significance regarding the epidemic, it comes through cuts to the office in charge of coordinating drug policy, Medicaid, public health programs, and more. And there is nothing in the budget to balance out the cuts — leaving a crater in the government’s response to a crisis that led to more than 33,000 opioid overdose deaths and more than 52,000 total drug overdose deaths in 2015. Drug policy advocates have said for years that the federal government, including the Obama administration, has reacted slowly to the opioid epidemic — given that it took until 2016 for Congress and President Barack Obama to pass any major legislation responding directly to the epidemic, finally adding $1 billion to drug treatment over two years through the 21st Century Cures Act. But advocates argue that the drug overdose crisis will require much more money than that, since it’s now killing more people than guns, cars, and even HIV/AIDS did at its peak. They hoped Trump, who on the campaign trail promised to “end the opioid epidemic in America” and “spend the money” on drug treatment, would bring a bigger commitment. “It would have been easy for Trump to come in and do better than Obama,” said Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. “But he’s off to an awful start.” It’s not just the budget plan. The spending proposal also fits the pattern we’ve seen with Trump on the opioid epidemic so far: Despite all his talk and promises on the campaign trail, this is an issue in which Trump is doing little to nothing as president — and the little his administration is doing will very likely prove counterproductive. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Trump’s budget does propose what amounts to a nearly 2 percent increase in drug treatment spending — with an increase of around $200 million to the $10.6 billion the federal government already spent on drug treatment. But there’s a huge catch to this increase: It includes the $500 million added by the 21st Century Cures Act, which was approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama. In other words, without the Cures Act spending that Congress put into place, Trump’s budget would actually cut drug treatment spending this year. In fact, this is what’s very likely to happen the year after Trump’s 2018 budget, since the Cures Act money is allocated only for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. What’s more, the money that is added simply falls far short of what advocates want. Kolodny, for one, estimated that the US will need to spend potentially tens of billions of dollars more a year on the epidemic — far more than Trump or anyone else has put forward. (To this end, he is also highly critical of the Obama administration; he argues it took too long to do anything on the epidemic, and what it did was far too small.) Trump, at the very least, doesn’t propose cutting overall drug treatment spending this year, based on ONDCP’s figures. But he suggests other cuts to public health and anti-drug programs that completely outweigh the tiny gains that ONDCP claims. For one, the budget proposal slashes drug prevention programs across all federal agencies by about 11 percent — from about $1.5 billion to more than $1.3 billion. The budget didn’t, as originally rumored, suggest a 95 percent cut to ONDCP, which is the top office in charge of coordinating anti-drug programs spread through multiple federal agencies. But it does propose cutting some of the office’s programs by a few percentage points. Some drug policy advocates see ONDCP as somewhat problematic, given its history of supporting ineffective “tough on drug” policies. But they argue the office should be reformed and propped up to lead the response to the opioid epidemic, not cut back. Kolodny agreed. He said, “There are things that ONDCP can do. Certainly, in the midst of this epidemic … cutting funding to an office that can play a role in coordinating a response is foolish. [Trump] should be looking in different ways to be finding more money for the opioid crisis, not cutting ONDCP.” Trump also proposes a 47 percent cut to Medicaid over the next 10 years. This would rob millions of people of the one affordable source of health insurance that they have — to pay for, in part, drug treatment. According to a 2014 study by Truven Health Analytics researchers, Medicaid paid for a quarter, or $7.9 billion of $31.3 billion, of projected public and private spending for drug treatment in 2014. As a patient using Medicaid to pay for drug addiction care at a New Jersey facility told me earlier this year, “If it wasn’t for insurance, I wouldn’t be here.” The budget further asks for nearly $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, hundreds of millions in cuts to mental health block grants, and billions in cuts altogether to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This funding didn’t all go specifically to drug treatment, but these agencies and programs in part help address the opioid epidemic and drug addiction in general. Advocates are already sounding the alarm over these cuts. The Baltimore City Health Department, for example, said in a statement, “At a time of a public health emergency around opioids, with unprecedented numbers of Marylanders dying from overdose, this proposal could deprive millions of the care that they need.” Finally, the budget significantly increases overall spending on federal law enforcement. It’s unclear exactly how much of this will go toward fighting drugs. But generally, drug policy experts and researchers agree that what’s needed is not more policing but more spending on drug treatment. After all, the US has spent hundreds of billions on anti-drug law enforcement for decades — and it didn’t prevent the opioid epidemic. The budget proposal is likely dead on arrival. It needs Congress’s approval to become law, and Congress will likely put forward its own spending measures instead of using Trump’s. But the budget plan is still the most comprehensive policy agenda that we can expect from the Trump administration at this point — and it shows a total lack of interest in seriously addressing the opioid epidemic. The rest of Trump’s opioid policy isn’t much better. Generally, it can be described as the opposite of what Trump said on the campaign trail — instead of allocating more funding to deal with the epidemic as a public health issue, he’s often undercutting such efforts. Beyond his budget proposal, here’s a broad rundown of what the Trump administration has said and done on opioids since Trump took office: The only concrete action on this list is Sessions’s memo, which doubled down on the old war on drugs. But the research suggests that this “tough on crime” approach — focused on increasing criminal penalties for drugs to, hopefully, deter drug use — just won’t work. For example, a 2014 study from Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago found there’s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply-elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than lighter penalties. So increasing the severity of the punishment doesn’t seem to do much, if anything, to slow the flow of drugs. Similarly, a 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration explained only about 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, while other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’90s. That’s why criminal justice experts now emphasize that there are better ways, from new policing tactics to more stringent alcohol policies, to bring down crime without resorting to longer prison sentences. The punitive criminalization of drugs is also sometimes a reason that drug users don’t seek care. Reporter Maia Szalavitz, who’s covered addiction for decades, has long argued that criminalization just leads to stigma, which pushes drug users underground. And a 2009 report by the libertarian Cato Institute found that after Portugal decriminalized all drugs, more drug users sought treatment because the policy change removed the fear of arrest and the stigma attached to it. At the same time, Trump has, if anything, vowed to reduce funding on opioid addiction care through his budget cuts — contradicting his campaign promise to “spend the money” on drug treatment. The fundamental problem in the opioid crisis is that America needs to put a lot more resources toward drug addiction prevention and treatment. In 2016, the surgeon general released the most comprehensive analysis of the state of addiction in America. Its core finding was that the US massively underfunds addiction care. It found, for example, that just 10 percent of Americans with a drug use disorder get specialty treatment, in large part due to a shortage in treatment options. The Obama administration took some steps to alleviate this. It dedicated $2.5 million in 2015 to fight heroin use. Its Department of Health and Human Services also unlocked more than $100 million for drug treatment in 2016. And Congress in 2016, with Obama’s approval, allocated $1 billion over two years to combat the opioid epidemic. But experts widely agree that this all was far, far from enough. They have hoped that Trump would do more, given that some of his biggest areas of support are places that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. “We need a massive increase in funding for addiction treatment,” Kolodny argued. “We’re not going to get anywhere in terms of reducing overdose deaths until you have very low threshold access to buprenorphine treatment or methadone in some cases” — referring to two medications used for treating opioid addiction. Beyond drug treatment, the federal government could do more to stop doctors from prescribing so many opioid painkillers, whose overprescription launched the epidemic. The FDA, for example, could limit how drug companies promote opioids, forcing them to follow CDC recommendations to not use the drugs for chronic non-cancer pain. (There is no good scientific evidence for the use of opioids for chronic pain, while there’s plenty of evidence that prolonged use can result in very bad complications, including a higher risk of addiction, overdose, and death.) Instead of doing any of this, Trump has proposed cutting public health programs and Medicaid, and he’s pushed to repeal Obamacare without a replacement that would cover Americans’ health insurance needs. More broadly, Trump has done nothing to address the structural issues behind drug addiction — the poverty, joblessness, deteriorating communities, and other common contributors to despair that lead to drug addiction. “If you look at overall public health trends, there are a lot of things like alcohol use and suicide that have increased in concert with opioid use,” said Leo Beletsky, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University. “That speaks to underlying, larger problems.” It’s not unusual for Trump to make a promise and do the opposite. But in this case, people’s lives are quite literally at stake — and his administration is at best dawdling and at worst taking steps that will make a very deadly crisis even deadlier.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/23/15680096/trump-budget-opioid-epidemic,,Vox
306,306,25-03-18 00:00,2018,3,25,,Russia denies aiding Afghan Taliban in wake of U.S. general's comments,"KABUL (Reuters) - Russia has rejected comments by NATO’s top commander in Afghanistan that it has been supporting and even supplying weapons to the Taliban, in a clash of words that underlines growing tension over Moscow’s involvement in the conflict.  In an interview with the BBC last week, General John Nicholson said that Russia had been acting to undermine U.S. efforts in Afghanistan despite shared interests in fighting terrorism and narcotics, with indications that Moscow was providing financial support and even arms.  “We’ve had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said this was given by the Russians to the Taliban,” he said.  A statement from the Russian embassy in Kabul dismissed the comments as “idle gossip”, repeating previous denials by Russian officials.  “Once again, we insist that such statements are absolutely baseless and appeal to officials not to talk nonsense,” the embassy said.  U.S. commanders, including Nicholson, have said on several occasions over the past year that Russia may be supplying arms to the Taliban although no confirmed evidence has so far been made public.  However, Nicholson’s comments were unusually blunt and came in a context of growing tensions between NATO members and Moscow over the case of Sergei Skripal, a former intelligence agent found poisoned with a rare nerve agent in Britain.  Russian officials have said that their limited contacts with the Taliban were aimed at encouraging peace talks and ensuring the safety of Russian citizens. Moscow has offered to help coordinate peace talks in Afghanistan.  Taliban officials have told Reuters that the group has had significant contacts with Moscow since at least 2007, adding that Russian involvement did not extend beyond “moral and political support”.  Moscow has been critical of the United States and NATO over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, but Russia initially helped provide helicopters for the Afghan military and agreed to a supply route for coalition materials through Russia.  Most of that cooperation has fallen apart as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated in recent years over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.

307,307,24-02-16 18:25,2016,2,24,Tanya Pai,"Hollywood's extreme lack of diversity, explained by a brilliant Tumblr","The Academy Awards are just a few days away, and amid the excitement is some vocal frustration at the fact that the films and people being recognized are, once again, overwhelmingly white and male. It's a well-documented problem not just in the Academy but in Hollywood overall — and the brilliant Tumblr Every Single Word found a creative way to illustrate the severity of the issue. Created by 27-year-old Venezuelan American actor and playwright Dylan Marron, Every Single Word shows what Hollywood films would look like if they were condensed to just the lines spoken by minorities over the course of their run times. As it turns out, many would be much more like Vine videos than feature-length films. Marron was fed up with hearing that as a nonwhite actor he was ""never going to play the romantic male lead,"" as he told the Washington Post's Soraya Nadia McDonald in an interview in July 2015, so he set out to show just how few minorities are playing lead parts in Hollywood. Take, for instance, American Hustle, which was nominated for 10 Oscars in 2015 — Marron's minorities-only cut comes in at 53 seconds: Or critical darling Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, which clocks in at an anemic 10 seconds: Or the 2014 Biblical epic Noah, coming in at ... zero: To the Post's McDonald, Marron explained how he picks the movies he features on his Tumblr: There’s a big variety of movies, but they do have one thing in common: all of these movies are not about whiteness. They are not about white people. They are not about the experience of being white and they are not historical dramas that are just about white people. They’re not about whiteness. They are about really universal and very human themes. He continued: So my question with these videos is why are we using white people to tell these universal stories? And what is that saying? I think it’s saying something really dangerous and the message it gives to people of color — and I can say this as a person of color who grew up watching these stories that I related to thematically and didn’t see reflections of myself in them — what it tells you is you don’t really have a place in this world. The idea of white as the ""normal"" is longstanding, pervasive, and ties into the concept of implicit bias that manifests itself in American society in areas as widespread as criminal justice and education. One area in which diversity has seen an uptick recently is in television: Shows like ABC’s Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat and the ratings behemoth that was the first season of Fox’s Empire proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that not only is there an audience for series centered on nonwhite characters, but that they have the potential to be hugely successful. However, there's also the Mindy Kaling–created The Mindy Project, the first network TV series created by and starring an Indian American (and a woman, no less), which has been criticized for not having enough focus on the lead's ethnicity — or as Al Jazeera's E. Alex Chung phrased it, ""Almost any exchange [Kaling's character Mindy] Lahiri has about race appears meant to prove that she is not one of the others but a full-blooded American."" But while television is making strides toward diversity, the silver screen still notably lags behind. In its 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, UCLA's Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies found that ""[a]lthough minorities posted several modest gains in several Hollywood employment arenas since the last report, they remain underrepresented on every front."" The report examined the top 200 theatrical releases from both 2012 and 2013, and found that minorities, who comprise 40 percent of the US population, were sorely underrepresented as male leads: Ralph J. Bunche Center As cast members: Ralph J. Bunche Center And as directors: Ralph J. Bunche Center The Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, from the Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative at USC's Annenberg School, found that of 414 films and TV series studied, women had only one-third of the speaking roles and minorities just 28.3 percent. And the lack of diversity is not just for lack of effort; as the Washington Post's Alyssa Rosenberg pointed out in a May 2015 piece aptly titled ""How Hollywood stays white and male"": the same laws that protect against employment discrimination also block certain efforts to hire more women and people of color. Networks can set goals for how many female writers they want to hire, or how many characters of color they want to see on screen, but they can’t legally use quotas to reach those goals. Marron's Tumblr serves to point out that while show biz may be improving in some areas, its diversity problem is far from ""fixed."" And he summed up that impact on this year's Oscars succinctly:",https://www.vox.com/2015/7/12/8932191/hollywood-lacks-diversity,,Vox
308,308,27-02-16 14:00,2016,2,27,Heather Smith,"What determines whether people accept climate science? Politics, politics, politics.","Originally published on Grist. What kind of person doesn’t believe climate change is a problem? What kind of person does? Behold, a new set of answers to this thorny social science question, released earlier this week in the journal Nature Climate Change. Or rather, a whole lot of old answers, derived from data assembled over the past eight years: 12 Pew surveys, three British polls collected by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, an International Social Survey conducted across 32 countries, eight Australian polls, and the Eurobarometer (the thoughts of 30 European nations, gathered by the European Commission). The paper’s authors describe their work as ""the first meta-analytic examination of the demographic and psychological correlates of belief in climate change."" So what did they find out? And it matters more than anyone harboring idealistic notions of working across the aisle might think. It breaks down this way: People who vote for liberal political parties are more likely to believe that climate change is a real thing that we should do something about. People who vote for conservative political parties tend to think that climate change is total hooey. Political affiliation correlated with belief in climate change twice as strongly as any other demographic variable the study examined. There are a whole lot of other ways of thinking of climate change beyond the binary ""it is/isn’t happening"" (like: climate change is real, but actually good for us). But in this meta-analysis, the study’s authors didn’t find much of a middle ground when they looked at all the studies in aggregate. This led them to hypothesize that, on average, belief (or lack of belief) in climate change correlates with political affiliation rather than with some other complex intellectual process that might only have a little bit to do with politics. This meta-analysis looked at data collected from all over the world and found that, planet-wise, people who believed that climate change is happening tended to be younger, more educated, higher-income, female, and less white — but that, again, none of these factors correlated with belief in the reality of climate change as strongly as political affiliation. Early studies showed that people who believed in climate change and people who didn’t had roughly equivalent levels of scientific understanding. Those studies have been called into question, because they basically let people self-report their awesomeness at understanding science. Later studies have tried to control for that with a few actual science questions, and the meta-analysis did find that people who answered science questions correctly were more likely to believe in climate change. Also: Just liking scientists and thinking that they’re trustworthy was correlated with belief in climate change, whether or not scientific understanding was high. A test called the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) is the tool social scientists commonly use to attempt to quantify concern for the environment. (Test takers agree or disagree with statements like, ""Plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist."") Unsurprisingly, people who score high for environmental concern on the NEP also tend to believe in climate change. There’s no way of knowing yet if this is a trickle-down effect from the government action or a trickle-up effect from the people in those countries demanding that the government do something. As the study puts it: A set of experimental studies have drawn on the social psychological literature on subliminal priming to examine whether priming people with environmental cues of climate change (for example, turning up the heat in the laboratory; placing dead trees around participants) has an effect on their belief in climate change. The observed link between these inductions and climate change belief are significant, perhaps surprisingly so given their impact is unconscious. So Ayn Rand probably wouldn’t have been a big climate activist. People who are fans of free markets also tended to not believe in climate change. So what is someone interested in talking with people about climate change to do with all this information? I mean, aside from locking the entire world in a hot room with a bunch of dead trees? The study’s authors recommend this: Remember that climate change, whether you like it or not, is a political issue. As they put it, ""The data suggest that evidence around climate change is searched, remembered, and assimilated in a way that dovetails with people’s own political loyalties and worldviews."" They also found that even people who believed in climate change grew skittish when talk turned to specific policies to mitigate it. In other words, it might be time for the social sciences as they relate to climate change to move beyond the question of who thinks climate change is real and more in the direction of why people feel the way they do. Actually getting things done could focus less on winning hearts and minds and more on working with people’s existing ideologies, rather than against them. As the study puts it, ""Pro-environmental action could be sold as patriotism, ending oil dependence, or investing in ‘green’ technologies."" Science is what helped people understand that climate change was happening in the first place — but actually persuading people to do something about it will be politics all the way.

313,313,27-04-18 00:00,2018,4,27,Nidal al-Mughrabi,"Israeli forces kill three Gaza border protesters, wound 600: medics","GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead three protesters along the Gaza border on Friday, Gaza medics said, hours after the United Nations human rights chief criticized Israel for using “excessive force” against demonstrators.   Israeli troops have killed 41 Palestinians and wounded more than 5,000 others since Gaza residents began staging protests along the border fence on March 30 to demand the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  The troops were holed up behind fortifications on their side of the 40km (25-mile) border fence and fired live ammunition and tear gas at protesters at five locations on the Gazan side.   Gaza medical officials said two protesters who were struck by bullets were in critical condition in hospital and 600 others were wounded.  The Israeli military said 12,000-14,000 Gazans were participating in what it described as “riots,” and that some had tried to breach the border into Israel. It said troops “had operated in accordance with the rules of engagement” to stop people crossing the border.   The Gaza health ministry said 200 were wounded by gun fire, including a Palestinian journalist who was hit in the foot by a bullet.  Dozens more, including four medics, were treated for gas inhalation, as Israeli forces showered the area with tear gas canisters from behind their fortifications in Israel.   Protesters hurled stones and rolled burning tires toward the fence, and some attached cans of burning petrol to kites and flew them into Israeli territory.  Others cleared away barbed wire coils which Israeli troops had placed in Gazan territory overnight in a bid to create a buffer zone between protesters and the fence.  After dark, the Israeli military said in a statement that its fighter jets had struck six targets belonging to Hamas’ naval force “in response to the terror activity and mass attempt to infiltrate into Israeli territory earlier today.”  Hamas said two boats moored off the Gaza shore were hit, causing damage, but that no casualties were reported.   The protests come at a time of growing frustration for Palestinians as prospects for an independent Palestinian state look poor. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled for several years and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have expanded.   In a statement, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein called the loss of life deplorable and said a “staggering number” of injuries had been caused by live ammunition.  Israel’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment but the government has consistently said it is protecting its borders and that its troops are following rules of engagement.  Israel’s U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, told the Security Council on Thursday that Hamas in Gaza was responsible for Palestinian casualties and that it was using innocent Palestinian women and children as human shields.   “The terrorists are hiding while allowing, even hoping, for their people to die. This is evil in its purest form,” he said.  Hamas denies the Israeli accusations. “Danon’s comments are an attempt to escape responsibility and to cover up for the execution of unarmed children and people by occupation soldiers,” said Hamas official Mushir Al-Masri.  Named the ‘Great March of Return’, the protest action revives a longstanding demand for the right of return of Palestinian refugees to towns and villages which their families fled from, or were driven out of, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. Israel refuses any right of return, fearing that the country would lose its Jewish majority.  More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into the narrow coastal enclave. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border.

314,314,30-11-16 19:44,2016,11,30,Zack Beauchamp,The Pakistani government released a readout of its call with Trump. It’s magical.,"On Wednesday afternoon, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Donald Trump to talk about working together in the future. The Pakistani government then released what’s called a “readout,” which is usually a fairly boring summary of a call between world leaders. Only this one … well, it’s not boring. It reads more like a transcript of actual things Trump said to Sharif, and those things are amazing. Here’s the readout in full: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called President-elect USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory. President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me any time even before 20th January that is before I assume my office. On being invited to visit Pakistan by the Prime Minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people, said Mr. Donald Trump. Obviously, these could just be paraphrases, but the quotes just sound so much like Trump. It’s hard to imagine some Pakistani bureaucrat making up Trumpy lines like “Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people” — which, come to think of it, begs the question of who the least intelligent people are. Also, it’s worth noting that these “most intelligent people” would be blocked from entering the United States under Trump’s “Muslim ban.” We’ve reached out to the Trump team and the Pakistani government to confirm whether these are actual quotes or just truly inspired paraphrasing.",https://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/30/13797178/donald-trump-call-nawaz-sharif,,Vox
315,315,26-06-19 00:00,2019,6,26,Francesco Guarascio,Facebook crypto plans turn up heat on EU banks over real-time payments,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone could have an instant payments system shared by all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020, finance industry officials said, as lenders face more competition from the likes of Facebook and other tech firms.   Real-time payments have been possible in the 19-country currency bloc since 2017, but only about half of the euro zone’s banks have joined the scheme that underpins these transactions  and it is mostly used for domestic payments.  The project could now accelerate as banks feel the heat of new competitors like Facebook, which last week unveiled plans for a cryptocurrency that would offer seamless payments to its users worldwide.  “The clock is ticking,” said Etienne Goosse, director general of the European Payments Council (EPC), that brings together large European banks, including Spain’s Santander, Deutsche Bank and France’s Societe Generale.  Goosse said that regardless of Facebook’s success with its move into payments, big technology firms were here to stay and banks needed to move more quickly.  He said the big tech firms had the advantage of being global unlike the fragmented European banking industry.  “They come with a global solution, under a global brand offering many things that the consumers seem to find wonderful,” Goosse said when asked about the impact of Facebook’s plans for crypto currency Libra.  “So we have no time.”  The EPC standard for instant payments has so far been adopted by some 60% of lenders and payment services providers in the euro zone, Goosse said, adding that it could be spread to all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020.  Without full coverage, some bank customers could experience transaction failures if transfers involve banks outside the system, which would reduce trust in the new service, another EPC official said.  Instant payments allow transactions between individuals and businesses to complete in a matter of seconds. Traditional transfers take at least one day before the payment is credited.  Other industry officials confirmed that 2020 was a credible target. But for the system to work across borders existing clearing and settlement mechanisms should cover the whole euro zone. These mechanisms make sure money is correctly transferred between parties.  Several private clearing houses use the EPC standard for instant payments like EBA Clearing, which brings together Europe’s largest banks, or national counterparties like Spain’s Iberpay or Italy’s Nexi.   The European Central Bank in November launched its own settlement system for real-time transactions, known as TIPS, which stands for Target Instant Payment Settlement.  But each of these different systems cover only a few dozen banks, making instant payments often impossible among lenders that are not members of the same clearing houses.  “The challenge now is to make these mechanisms interoperable,” said Piet Mallekoote, the CEO of the Dutch Payment Association. The Netherlands has already made instant payments available to all bank customers in the country via a project backed by seven major domestic banks, including ING and ABN AMRO.   But even if a payments system is rolled out across the euro zone this may not be enough to attract customers away from  fintech providers with easy to use apps.  Facebook can already tap into its established social media and chat services, but banks would need to agree on applications like mobile payments or use customers’ existing payment cards to convince them to use banks’ instant payment services.

317,317,05-09-17 13:00,2017,9,5,Sarah Kliff,This is what Obamacare sabotage looks like,"The Trump administration has, quite brazenly, moved into Obamacare sabotage mode — hurting the most vulnerable participants as it puts the law itself at risk. Health and Human Services announced Thursday it would cut the Obamacare sign-up budget by 72 percent. Advertising funding will fall from $100 million to $10 million for the 2018 enrollment season. In-person outreach dollars will decline from $62.5 million to $36 million. The Affordable Care Act’s success hinges on a large number of healthy people enrolling in marketplace coverage. These policy changes only make senses as ones that would undermine that goal. Experts expect that less outreach and less advertising will lead to fewer people enrolling in coverage, and those most likely to be left behind are the young, healthy enrollees who hold down premiums for everyone else. Those in-person outreach efforts also ensure that vulnerable populations, like those that don’t speak English or lack internet access, can still enroll. Instead of making Obamacare more robust and inclusive, they’re setting the law up to fail. Fewer people know about the opportunity to enroll when advertising falls by 90 percent. We know that, in part, because sign-ups fell off when the Trump administration pulled Obamacare ads in late January, shortly after taking office. In-person enrollment groups are preparing to lay off staffs; one has already begun to furlough workers after learning of the budget cuts. The likely outcome is that the marketplaces will be made up of people who remember to sign up are on their own. Those people are expected to be sicker — people who really need insurance — meaning premiums will rise for all Obamacare enrollees in 2019. Trump administration officials offered flimsy justifications for the budget cuts. Public awareness is already high, they said, in making the case for a 90 percent reduction in advertising — ignoring data suggesting that 40 percent of the remaining uninsured are unaware of the marketplace and its enrollment period. The Trump administration plans to penalize in-person enrollment groups that have fallen below their sign-up goals. It will not, however, reward those that have exceeded expectations. “That is not part of the methodology,” one HHS official said. Obamacare advocates have, for months, worried about subtle forms of sabotage that would be difficult to spot — not staffing the Healthcare.gov call center appropriately, for example, or not rushing to fix technical glitches on the website. Most did not expect such a brazen and significant cut to the enrollment budget. They don’t expect Obamacare can keep up its enrollment numbers with such a significant budget cut. “I see us either having to reduce staff or leverage funding somewhere else,” says Randal Serr, director of Take Care Utah. “It’s a pretty strange time for us.” The Affordable Care Act requires the federal government to run a “navigator program,” that provides grants to local nonprofits and health care organizations to increase awareness of the law, enroll consumers in coverage, and troubleshoot issues they have with their new coverage. The Obama administration had given the program between $60 and $67 million annually over last four years. The Trump administration will provide $36 million next year, a 41 percent cut. The navigator program cuts will likely hurt the most vulnerable Obamacare enrollees, those who needed extra assistance to become enrolled in coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 79 percent of Obamacare enrollees who sign up with in-person help do so because they “lack confidence to apply on their own.” Seventy-seven person say they need help understanding plan choices, and 31 percent lack internet service at home. One navigator program I covered recently, in Detroit, focuses on signing up Arab-American refugees who face language barriers while attempting to enroll in coverage — and, in many cases, are unaware the Affordable Care Act even existed. Another, in Kentucky, works with populations that are often enrolling in coverage for the first time. Trump officials explained that they will use “enrollment targets” that each navigator group set for themselves to distribute the funding cuts. A navigator group that only signed up 40 percent of its enrollment target, for example, will only receive 40 percent of last year’s funding. This will cut the program’s funding by an estimated $23 million. These enrollment targets are a suspicious metric to use for budgets. For one thing, they are set by the navigators themselves. This means that a group that lowballed their estimates is rewarded — while a nonprofit that set an ambitious goal gets penalized. These two groups might have done equally good work signing people up for coverage; the only difference is where they set their goals. Navigators say the Obama administration repeatedly encouraged them to set high goals as a motivator. They had no idea these numbers would become part of the funding scheme. “CMS was telling us set high goals and even if you don’t hit those goals, we want to aim to help as many people as possible,” says Serr from Utah. In-person enrollments are only one part of the navigator program’s mission. Much of the group’s time is spent answering questions over the phone, attending community events to raise awareness, and helping new enrollees understand their coverage after they sign up. The Palmetto Project in South Carolina, for example, operates in a largely rural area of the state that had low rates of insurance before the health law started. The group has directly signed 1,900 people up for marketplace coverage this year — but has also answered 24,000 inquiries about health law coverage in the same time frame. It has signed up many Medicaid enrollees too, but Quenga’s understanding is that those enrollments will not be counted in the new funding formula. “If our legal responsibility was simply to enroll, I might cave and be a bit more sympathetic,” says Quenga. “But we have five different responsibilities, and enrolling is only one of them. Outreach and education is a huge piece. You don’t get enrollments from teaching people to use their insurance.” When asked why they selected this metric, a Health and Human Services official said, “for the upcoming enrollment period, we are making funding decisions based on the facts and the principle of accountability.” Navigator groups have, for months now, said their grants would stay roughly the same in 2018, say Health and Human Services officials. They made plans based on those predictions: rented office space and started buying advertisements for the open enrollment season, which begins on November 1. Now, they’re not sure if they can afford that spending. “We’ve already started buying advertising, trying to sign contracts for the offices for our staff, we’re working with school superintendents to make flyers to go home with the kids in our districts,” says Kelly Allen, a navigator in West Virginia. “I don’t know if CMS has a good poker face or what.” “We’ve been moving forward as if nothing was going to change because we didn’t have much of another option,” says Serr. “I see us either having to reduce staff or leverage new funding. It’s a strange time.” The Trump administration also announced on Thursday that it will cut spending on advertising by 90 percent, paring back the Obama administration’s $100 million budget to a paltry $10 million. The type of advertising will change, too. The Obama administration often ran television and radio campaigns meant to reach a wide range of Americans who might consider purchasing coverage. The Trump administration has said it will focus on digital advertising, which is expected to take the form of reminder emails and texts to those who have already signed up for coverage. Obama administration officials like Lori Lodes, who previously ran health law outreach, said that television ads were the most effective way to run Obamacare outreach — and that the Trump administration has zeroed out that budget. They are spending ZERO dollars on TV ads. Despite having PROOF that it is the biggest driver of enrollment. In any case, $10 million is a very small number — especially when the administration is also putting out ads criticizing the Affordable Care Act, too. To put it in context, California is planning to spend $111.5 million on advertising in its state alone. The federal government will spend one-tenth of that in the 34 states where it runs the state health insurance marketplace. Trump had already spent twice as much on his own private travel by April of this year. HHS administration officials claimed they made this change because public awareness of the health care law is high, which means less advertising is needed. “People are aware of Obamacare and the exchanges, they are aware they can sign up,” an HHS official said. “The Obama administration doubled spending on advertising and saw a 5 percent decline in enrollment. Despite a doubled budget, there are diminishing returns.” The decline in health law enrollment, however, occurred in late January, around the moment the Trump administration abruptly canceled $5 million in advertisements after taking office. When pressed by a reporter, officials said they had not done any studies of the efficacy of enrollment advertising or whether public awareness is indeed quite high. “We haven’t done a specific study related to the public awareness of the program,” the third HHS official said. “I think most Americans are aware of the program at this point in time.” The research that has been done, however, suggests that public awareness of the health care law is not especially high among the uninsured — and that advertising does work to increase it. A Commonwealth Fund study from last year found that 38 percent of Americans who remain uninsured are unaware of the health law marketplaces. That number has declined slowly, year over year, but certainly has a way to go before all Americans are “aware they can sign up.” There is not a large body of research on Affordable Care Act advertising, but what has been done correlates more advertising with higher sign-up rates. A 2017 study published in the journal Health Affairs shows that “counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties.” Trump administration officials said that this new $10 million budget would bring Obamacare’s advertising spending in line with what the agency puts toward the Medicare program. But that doesn’t make much sense: Medicare is a program that has been around for 60 years, one that is well-established. Obamacare has been around for five. The Trump administration will advertise Obamacare less — and give enrollees a shorter time frame for enrollment. Unlike last year, where open enrollment ran from November 1 through January 31, this year’s open enrollment period will start November 1 and end December 15. Enrollees will get 45 days to sign up for coverage instead of 90. “The shorter open enrollment is one of my bigger concerns,” says Jodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids and Families, which runs the state’s largest navigator grant. “That’s going to surprise a lot of our customers. We’re reaching out to people, we’re calling anyone who has contact with our project over the past few years, to let them know.” A shorter open enrollment period coupled with less advertising and less in-person support will near certainly lead to fewer people signing up for Obamacare. The people most likely left behind fall into two categories: Obamacare’s healthy enrollees and its most vulnerable. Experts expect that people who really need health insurance — those with expensive medical conditions — will make sure they enroll in coverage. These are the consumers who are likely to check open enrollment dates and remember to sign up in time. Research from Yale health economist Amanda Kowalski has found that states that had significant technical glitches during the health law’s first open enrollment period ended up with a sicker set of Obamacare enrollees, suggesting that that population was more persistent in seeking coverage. A sicker Obamacare enrollee population will drive up premiums for anyone who wants to sign up for coverage in the future. In 2019, you’d expect insurance companies to set higher premiums to account for those higher medical bills. Cutting ACA outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. That will push premiums up. But there are some Obamacare enrollees with significant health care needs who won’t sign up for coverage. These are the vulnerable populations that rely on in-person Obamacare assistance, the program that will lose 40 percent of its budget next year. This might be the refugee I profiled in Detroit, who doesn’t speak English well enough to navigate the health care system. She relies on her health coverage for multiple medical conditions, some the result of trauma endured before immigrating to the US from Iraq. It might include the 20-year-old dishwasher I met in Kentucky who relies on his health law coverage to get prescriptions for his ADHD — who only found out that he was eligible for a plan because the local outreach group held an enrollment event at the restaurant where he works. The result of less Obamacare outreach and advertising is leaving behind these two populations: a healthy population that makes the marketplace work, and a sicker population that doesn’t necessarily know how to navigate the system without help.

What happened after Portugal decriminalized all drugs, from weed to heroin.  As diplomats gather at the United Nations in New York this week to consider the future of global drug policy, one Portuguese official, João Goulão, will likely command attention that far outstrips his country’s influence in practically any other area. That’s because 16 years ago, Portugal took a leap and decriminalized the possession of all drugs — everything from marijuana to heroin. By most measures, the move has paid off. Today, Portuguese authorities don’t arrest anyone found holding what’s considered less than a 10-day supply of an illicit drug — a gram of heroin, ecstasy, or amphetamine, two grams of cocaine, or 25 grams of cannabis. Instead, drug offenders receive a citation and are ordered to appear before so- called “dissuasion panels” made up of legal, social, and psychological experts. Most cases are simply suspended. Individuals who repeatedly come before the panels may be prescribed treatment, ranging from motivational counseling to opiate substitution therapy. “We had a lot of criticism at first,” recalled Goulão, a physician specializing in addiction treatment whose work led Portugal to reform its drug laws in 2000, and who is today its national drug coordinator. After decriminalizing, the first inquiries Portugal received from the International Narcotics Control Board — the quasi-judicial UN oversight body established by the UN drug convention system — were sharp and scolding. “Now things have changed completely,” he went on. “We are pointed to as an example of best practices inside the spirit of the conventions.” Indeed, Werner Sipp, the new head of the board, said as much at the UN’s Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna earlier this year. ‘It was the combination of the law and these services that made it a success. It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.’ As diplomats gather at the United Nations in New York this week to consider the future of global drug policy, one Portuguese official, João Goulão, will likely command attention that far outstrips his country’s influence in practically any other area.

It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.’ Though often narrowly assessed in reference to its decriminalization law, Portugal’s experience over the last decade and a half speaks as much to its free public health system, extensive treatment programs, and the hard to quantify trickle down effects of the legislation. In a society where drugs are less stigmatized, problem users are more likely to seek out care. Police, even if they suspect someone of using drugs, are less likely to bother them. Though at least 25 countries have introduced some form of decriminalization, Portugal’s holistic model and its use of dissuasion panels sets it apart. The rate of new HIV infections in Portugal has fallen precipitously since 2001, the year its law took effect, declining from 1,016 cases to only 56 in 2012. Overdose deaths decreased from 80 the year that decriminalization was enacted to only 16 in 2012. In the US, by comparison, more than 14,000 people died in 2014 from prescription opioid overdoses alone. Portugal’s current drug-induced death rate, three per million residents, is more than five times lower than the European Union’s average of 17.3, according to EU figures. When Portugal decided to decriminalize in 2000, many skeptics assumed that the number of users would skyrocket. That did not happen. With some exceptions, including a marginal increase among adolescents, drug use has fallen over the past 15 years and now ebbs and flows within overall trends in Europe. Portuguese officials estimate that by the late 1990s roughly one percent of Portugal’s population, around 100,000 people, were heroin users. Today, “we estimate that we have 50,000, most of them under substitution treatment,” said Goulão before adding that he’s recently seen a small uptick in use of the drug, predominantly among former addicts that got clean. This reflects Portugal’s tenuous economic condition, he contends. “People use drugs for one of two reasons — either to potentiate pleasures or relieve unpleasure — and the types of drugs and the type of people who use drugs carries a lot according to the conditions of life in the country,” he remarked. Parallel harm reduction measures, such as needle exchanges and opioid substitution therapy using drugs like methadone and buprenorphine, he said, serve as a cushion to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and a rise in overdoses even if the number of users injecting heroin happens to increase for a period of time. “I think harm reduction is not giving up on people,” said Goulão. “I think it is respecting their timings and assuming that even if someone is still using drugs, that person deserves the investment of the state in order to have a better and longer life.” Such statements, once considered radical, are becoming more appealing to drug officials in other countries. Decriminalization and harm reduction lends greater attention to the human rights of users while allowing law enforcement resources to be spent elsewhere. And though it’s a major shift, Portuguese decriminalization is not a revolution in terms of international law. Drugs are still illegal in Portugal, drug dealers and traffickers are still sent to jail, and the country has carefully kept itself within the confines of the UN’s drug convention system that inform national drug laws. For decades the three treaties were seen as prescribing jail time for users, but experts have long contended — and governments now increasingly recognize — that they give countries wide latitude in how to treat and police users. When Portugal decriminalized, UN member states were just years removed from a 1998 special session of the General Assembly that convened under the fanciful pretext of eliminating drug use worldwide. On Tuesday, member states adopted a new outcome document that is meant to reposition drug policy. It stops short of what many advocates would have liked, excluding the actual words “harm reduction” while failing to address the death penalty for drug offenders, which member states noted repeatedly on Tuesday. The document reflects both an evolution in drug policy in many parts of the world over the last two decades, but is also a testament to the continued influence of conservative countries that still favor interdiction. Goulão himself is skeptical of some aspects of marijuana reform in places like the United States, which he says can conflate medical use with recreational markets. “Sometimes I feel the promoters of this discussion are mixing things together using a lack of intellectual seriousness,” he said. Though heroin use is often highlighted to show the efficacy of Portugal’s model, today most users that come before panels are in fact caught with either hashish or cannabis, said Nuno Capaz, a sociologist who serves on Lisbon’s dissuasion panel. Between 80 to 85 percent of all people who report to the panels are first-time offenders and deemed to be recreational users, meaning their cases are suspended. For those who have been repeatedly caught or are identified as addicts, the panels can order sanctions or treatment. Recreational users may face fines or be ordered to provide community service. If an addict refuses treatment, they are required to check in regularly with their “family doctor” — the medical professional in the person’s locality that provides checkups and other services to them under Portugal’s free national healthcare program. Such a close, pre-existing relationship between medical professionals and Portuguese residents is another feature of the model, and one that could be hard to replicate in a country like the US. “If the person doesn’t show up at the doctor, we ask the police to personally hand them a notification so they know they are supposed to be in a specific place,” said Capaz. “The important part is to maintain the connection to the treatment system.” The role of police coordinating with health officials to ensure treatment demonstrates the altered relationship between them and drug users over the past decade and a half, and one that contrasts dramatically with how police orient themselves in countries like the US. “This small change actually makes a huge change in terms of police officers’ work,” said Capaz, referring to decriminalization. “Of course every police officer knows where people hang out to smoke joints. If they wanted to they would just go there and pick up the same guy over and over. That doesn’t happen.” Working in parallel to government efforts, non-profit groups play a role in providing clean needles and even distributing crack pipes as a way to entice drug users into the network of state service providers. Ricardo Fuertes, project coordinator at GAT, an outreach organization founded by people living with HIV, works at one of the group’s drop-in centers, nestled in a residential building in Lisbon. The location, he says, is a sign of the decrease in stigma towards drug use. “It’s very obvious that it’s a place for people who use drugs. It’s very open, but we don’t have complaints,” said Fuertes, referring to the drop-in center. “The general population even comes to get tests done. I think it shows this isn’t a ghetto service.” But care and outreach providers and the people they help have felt the pinch of Portugal’s economic troubles. In 2011, the country was bailed out by the European Union and the IMF, and later passed austerity measures that imposed considerable cuts on public services. Goulão said that drug treatment programs have been relatively insulated, but funds for job programs that could help employers pay the wages of drug users were decreased. Fuertes went a bit further, saying that some providers have had to lower costs. He explained that government funding may be allocated only for a year at a time, making long-term planning difficult. “It’s not easy for many people, and of course people who use drugs are not the exception,” he said. “We see many of our clients facing very difficult situations.” Portuguese health workers refer to Greece as a cautionary tale. Wracked by a budgetary crisis and the austerity conditions of repeated bailouts, Greece experienced an explosion of HIV transmission rates after budget cuts left health programs drastically underfunded. According to EU figures, only Greece and Latvia experienced larger cuts than Portugal to its public health services between the period of 2005 to 2007 and 2009 to 2012. And yet Portugal experienced no discernable rise in HIV transmission — the cushion effect in action. “Usually the focus is on the decriminalization itself, but it worked because there were other services, and the coverage increased for needle replacement, detox, therapeutic communities, and employment options for people who use drugs,” said Fuertes. “It was the combination of the law and these services that made it a success. It’s very difficult to find people in Portugal who disagree with this model.” In the run-up to the UN General Assembly’s special session, Goulão cautioned that countries had to consider their own domestic environments first in learning from Portugal’s experience. “We don’t assume that this is the silver bullet, but in my view it has been very important because it introduced coherence into the whole system,” he said. “If our responses are based in the idea that we talking about addiction, that we are talking about chronic disease, talking about a health issue — to have it out of the penal system is a clear improvement. It was really important for our society because it allowed us to drop the stigma.” Follow Samuel Oakford on Twitter: @samueloakford",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3nzz4/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin,,Vice News

323,323,19-04-19 00:00,2019,4,19,"Doina Chiacu, David Morgan","Democrats make legal bid for all Russia probe evidence, Trump poll numbers drop","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Friday took legal action to get hold of all of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s evidence from his inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as the probe’s findings hit President Donald Trump’s poll ratings.   The number of Americans who approve of Trump dropped by 3 percentage points to the lowest level of the year following the release of a redacted version of Mueller’s report on Thursday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll.  Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russians but did find “multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.”  While Mueller ultimately decided not to charge Trump with a crime such as obstruction of justice, he also said that the investigation did not exonerate the president, either.                   U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, issued a subpoena to the Justice Department to hand over the full Mueller report and other relevant evidence by May 1.  “My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice. The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case,” Nadler said in a statement.  The report provided extensive details on Trump’s efforts to thwart Mueller’s investigation, giving Democrats plenty of political ammunition against the Republican president but no consensus on how to use it.      The document has blacked out sections to hide details about secret grand jury information, U.S. intelligence gathering and active criminal cases as well as potentially damaging information about peripheral players who were not charged.  Six top congressional Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected Attorney General William Barr’s offer to give them access to a less-redacted version of the report. In a letter to Barr, they repeated their demand the full report be given to Congress, but said they were open to “a reasonable accommodation.”  Democratic leaders have played down talk of impeachment of Trump just 18 months before the 2020 presidential election, even as some prominent members of the party’s progressive wing, notably U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, promised to push the idea.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major contender for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination to call for the start of impeachment proceedings, saying on Twitter that “the severity of this misconduct” demands it.  “To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,” she said.  Trump, who has repeatedly called the Mueller probe a political witch hunt, lashed out again on Friday.  “Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report...which are fabricated & totally untrue,” Trump wrote on Twitter.  He seemed to be referring to former White House counsel Don McGahn who was cited in the report as having annoyed Trump by taking notes of his conversations with the president.      “Watch out for people that take so-called “notes,” when the notes never existed until needed.” Trump wrote, “it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the “Report” about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad).”  Phone conversations between the president and McGahn in June 2017 were a central part of Mueller’s depiction of Trump as trying to derail the Russia inquiry. The report said Trump told McGahn to instruct the Justice Department to fire Mueller. McGahn did not carry out the order.        In analyzing whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller revealed details about how the president tried to fire him and limit his investigation, kept details of a June 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian under wraps, and possibly dangled a pardon to a former adviser.                   According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,005 adults conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning, 37 percent of people approve of Trump’s performance in office - down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matches the lowest level of the year. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.   Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the Democrats’ subpoena “is wildly overbroad” and would jeopardize a grand jury’s investigations.  The Mueller inquiry laid bare what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.   Russia said on Friday that Mueller’s report did not contain any evidence that Moscow had meddled. “We, as before, do not accept such allegations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.     Asked on Friday about Russian interference in 2016, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington that “we will make very clear to them that this is not acceptable behavior.”  Trump has tried to cultivate good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and came under heavy criticism in Washington last year for saying after meeting Putin that he accepted his denial of election meddling, over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies.  Half a dozen former Trump aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were charged by Mueller’s office or convicted of crimes during his 22-month-long investigation. The Mueller inquiry spawned a number of other criminal probes by federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere.   One reason it would be difficult to charge Trump is that the Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president should not be indicted, although the U.S. Constitution is silent on whether a president can face criminal prosecution in court.  A paragraph in the report is at the heart of whether Mueller, a former FBI director, intended Congress to pursue further action against Trump.  “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,” Mueller wrote.    Republican Collins said Democrats had misconstrued that section of the report to suit their anti-Trump agenda.          “There seems to be some confusion...This isn’t a matter of legal interpretation; it’s reading comprehension,” Collins wrote on Twitter.   “The report doesn’t say Congress should investigate obstruction now. It says Congress can make laws about obstruction under Article I powers,” Collins said.  Nadler told reporters on Thursday that Mueller probably wrote the report with the intent of providing Congress a road map for future action against the president, but the Democratic congressman said it was too early to talk about impeachment.  But the House Oversight Committee’s Democratic chairman, Elijah Cummings, said impeachment was not ruled out.  “A lot of people keep asking about the question of impeachment ... We may very well come to that very soon, but right now let’s make sure we understand what Mueller was doing, understand what Barr was doing, and see the report in an unredacted form and all of the underlying documents,” he told MSNBC.  Short of attempting impeachment, Democratic lawmakers can use the details of Mueller’s report to fuel other inquiries already underway by congressional committees.  Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 after firing his secretary of war in the tumultuous aftermath of the American Civil War. Both were acquitted by the Senate and stayed in office.

Having worked in the media, I knew it could help people come to terms with their sexuality by letting them know they are not alone. Though we couldn't produce our own videos, we were able to take videos produced elsewhere and translate them. I collaborated with producers from around the world, subtitled their videos in Urdu, and released them on our platform. Soon we had producers contacting us and waving copyrights, allowing us to reproduce videos as we saw fit for a local audience. Watch VICE News' Blackout: Pakistan, about the plight of that country's LGBTQ community. But in the meantime, the backlash continued — and it worsened as we started to post more often. Our slogan was ""Don't hate us, know us."" This clearly was not taken to heart by everyone. In comments and private messages, people started calling for ""death for whoever is behind the project."" A friend of mine even told me I had gone too far, saying that while he could accept my ""lewd"" lifestyle, he objected to the way I was ""corrupting"" people. I got a phone call from someone who said, ""We're watching you,"" and that I should quit my ""online activities."" His number was blocked, and when I called the cellular company to request the number, I was told that I would need to go to the police first. But for me, that, of course, was impossible. By September of 2013, I was admittedly panicked. Some concerned activist friends were suggesting I shut down the project and run it from outside Pakistan; I ultimately decided to do neither. That month, however, the site became inaccessible, and a message from the federal government's Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) stated that QueerPK was ""not safe"" to be viewed in the country. I contacted international media outlets to inform them of the ban, and stories ran in several places, including the BBC and CNN. AFP interviewed the spokesperson of the PTA, who said the website was ""against Islam."" I transferred the site to a new domain, and announced it on social media platforms and mailing lists. However, the government soon banned this site as well. Since the project was self-financed and had only volunteers on whom to rely, I couldn't keep up with the game of online hide-and-seek. By early 2014, the project was dead. I have been attempting a third re-launch, but I am not optimistic about the future. I would still be battling the government if this was a fair fight, but when you're accused of doing something ""anti-Islam"" and ""anti-Pakistan,"" the government essentially has license to deal with you as it deems fit. I now sometimes ask God why he made me gay in a society like Pakistan.

325,325,28-06-19 00:00,2019,6,28,,U.S. consumer spending rises in May; inflation muted,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased moderately in May and prices rose slightly, pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures, which could give the Federal Reserve more ammunition to cut interest rates next month.  The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and spent more at restaurants and on hotel accommodation.  Data for April was revised up to show consumer spending advancing 0.6% instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.4% last month.  Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month as a rebound in food prices was tempered by moderate gains in the cost of other goods. The PCE price index increased 0.3% in April.   In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 1.5%, slowing from April’s 1.6% increase.  Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.2% last month after a similar gain in April. In the 12 months through May, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.6%, matching April’s rise.  The core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure and has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target this year. The Fed last week signaled rate cuts as early as July, citing low inflation, as well as growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.   The central bank downgraded its inflation projection for 2019 to 1.5% from 1.8% in March. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dropped his description of weak inflation as “transient.”   When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2% in May. This so-called real consumer spending increased by the same margin in April. The increase in real spending in the last two months suggested consumer spending was struggling to accelerate after slowing in the first quarter.  Consumers spending increased at a 0.9% annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest in a year. The overall economy grew at a 3.1% rate last quarter, boosted by exports, an accumulation of inventory and government spending on highways and defense.   Last month, spending on goods increased 0.5%, with outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles surging 1.7%. Spending on services gained 0.4%.  Consumer spending in May was supported by a 0.5% rise in  personal income, which matched April’s increase. Wages gained 0.2%. Savings rose to $985.4 billion from $975.0 billion in April.

326,326,12-08-18 16:30,2018,8,12,Jane Coaston,What Sunday’s Unite the Right 2 tells us about the state of the alt-right ,"On Sunday, “white civil rights activist” Jason Kessler will lead an undetermined number of alt-right, far-right, and white supremacist individuals and organizations in the “Unite the Right 2” gathering in Washington, DC, on the first anniversary of the group’s disastrous rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that claimed the life of a young woman. As I wrote earlier this week, the ultimate size of the event is anyone’s guess: It’s not clear how many people will attend Unite the Right 2 — many white nationalists have already said they have no interest in going, while others who might otherwise attend are enmeshed in legal troubles stemming from last year’s rally. Meanwhile, organizers of the coalition DC Against Hate have told at least one outlet that they expect at least 1,000 counterprotesters to attend events aimed against Unite the Right 2 under the banner “Shut It Down DC.” But no matter the number of rallygoers present, Unite the Right 2 — taking place on the first anniversary of much of America’s first experience of the alt-right’s racism and anti-Semitism — will have a lot to tell us. When Kessler applied for a permit to rally in Lafayette Square, directly across from the White House, he stated that he expected roughly 400 people to attend — a number he has since admitted in court he just “pulled out of a hat.” In short, it is extremely unlikely that attendance numbers will rival those of last year’s Unite the Right, which included a tiki torch-lit parade of white supremacists marching through the campus of the University of Virginia alongside the disastrous rally the following day that ended in the murder of counter-activist Heather Heyer. In a movement that is largely disintegrating, many of the biggest names in the alt-right and white supremacist far right are staying far away from this year’s rally. That’s both because of the aftermath of last year’s event and because of a debate roiling the alt-right about whether or not “optics” — like chanting, “Jews will not replace us,” before marching under a Nazi flag — matter, and whether they should even be rallying in public in the first place. But at least on one point, many within the alt-right agree: Jason Kessler is not to be trusted. As one neo-Nazi figure posted on the social media platform website Gab — which is popular with alt-right figures banned from Twitter — earlier this summer, “Follow Kessler and you get what you deserve.” Some within the alt-right even think that Kessler is a “subversive” who is leading the movement into risky situations like Unite the Right on purpose. Another Gab user arguing, “Avoiding this rally IS being tactical and strategic because there is only an opportunity for the media to use this to demonize Trump and his supporters as fascists.” For his part, Kessler is attempting to publicly distance himself from the white supremacist alt-right (while still filing court documents listing self-avowed anti-Semitic Holocaust deniers as potential speakers at Unite the Right 2.) And not only are many within the alt-right and white nationalist movement not attending this year — because of last year’s rally, “optics,” or Jason Kessler — but those who are attending are facing the ramifications of Kessler’s poor planning: ... coordinating this event has seemingly been chaotic at best, as revealed by recent internal Facebook chats from Unite the Right planners (obtained from an anonymous source by the media collective Unicorn Riot, a left-leaning investigative journalism nonprofit). The chats appear to show Kessler arguing with other planners about a wide range of issues. Those include basic logistics like transportation and housing; whether or not a nonwhite speaker would give them “political cover” to have major white supremacist figures speak as well; and whether there’s a good way to “normalize” anti-Semitism without appearing to do so (in other words, without using anti-Semitic memes). Attendance numbers, then, won’t tell us everything about how strong (or how fragmented) the alt-right has been since Charlottesville, but they will give us a snapshot of a part of the current movement. In the wake of the violence of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville — which an independent investigation showed the response of Charlottesville Police contributed to — DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, DC Chief of Police Peter Newsham, and regional police announced on Thursday that the city had already deployed its emergency operations center in advance of the rally. Other city officials told the media that regional police — including departments in Maryland and Virginia — were prepared for the rally. After a man fired a shot at a counterprotester in Charlottesville, no guns will be permitted at Unite the Right events or counterdemonstrations in Washington, with or without a permit. And as the groups participating in Unite the Right 2 plan to travel to and from the rally using Washington’s metro system, the Metro Transit Police are coordinating with local police and officials. Sharon Bulova from the Fairfax County Board of Governors tweeted that rallygoers will be meeting at the Vienna Metro Station to ride into Washington, and that law enforcement would have “an increased presence at the station.” The town of Vienna is located within Fairfax County. pic.twitter.com/Vbm9ZBHIes One advantage Washington enjoys in advance of the rally is significant experience with large-scale marches and events, from presidential inaugurations to the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. In addition, the site of the rally, Lafayette Square, is also federal land, under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, which is joining forces with DC Police and the US Secret Service (as the park is so close to the White House) to prevent any violence. National Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst told ABC7 in Washington, “The park police and the law enforcement partners are looking at any lessons that may be learned from previous demonstrations to ensure there is no violence.” The decision by many who attended the tiki torch-lit rally that launched Unite the Right last summer to dress in polo shirts and khaki pants was a purposeful one. As neo-Nazi organizer Andrew Anglin wrote on his Daily Stormer website in advance of the rally in 2017, rallygoers should avoid shorts, wear button-downs, and above all: It is very important to look good. ... I cannot stress the point hard enough – I’m hitting italics again – we need to be extremely conscious of what we look like, and how we present ourselves. That matters more than our ideas. If that is sad to you, I’m sorry, but that is just human nature. If people see a bunch of mismatched overweight slobs, they are not going to care what they are saying. But since the chaos of Charlottesville, the alt-right has been divided among those who want to attempt to look mainstream while advocating for white nationalism and anti-Semitism, and those who view such concerns over appearance as “optics-cucking.” As I wrote on Friday: Even before this year’s rally was announced, the alt-right had already been embroiled in a debate about whether caring about looking less like hardened fascists and neo-Nazis and more like everyday white American citizens is a goal or, as the Daily Beast first reported, an example of weakness or even “optics-cucking” — “cuck” being a reference to a pornography genre in which a man watches another man have sex with his wife. Kessler has taken the mainstream position, expressly forbidding any flags besides the American flag and the Confederate flag from being flown at the rally. But others who may be in attendance could be from the latter camp, and far more willing to wear alt-right and far-right regalia and display fascist and neo-Nazi symbols. How national media outlets depict the groups and individuals attending Unite the Right, the counterprotesters, and the rally itself will be critical to understanding the wider cultural impact that the alt-right movement is having. Part of the goal of the white supremacist alt-right is to push their opinions into the mainstream via mainstream media outlets. And many of those outlets, in their efforts to explain alt-right and white supremacist views, have been accused by some of “normalizing” them. Already, NPR has been heavily criticized for a seven-minute Morning Edition interview with Kessler where, with little pushback, Kessler defended his racist views and even listed racial groups by IQ. Media outlets should think long & hard before granting white supremacists a platform that can reach millions. This piece was not a general story quoting Kessler for a few seconds, among others--it was a one-on-one interview. No experts, no debunking or exposure of mistruths. https://t.co/14UdrDAvdJ The most important reactions to Unite the Right won’t be from rallygoers, or even from the media — they’ll be from politicians, including President Donald Trump, whose muted reaction to Charlottesville (saying there were “very fine people on both sides” at Unite the Right, for example) was widely criticized. On Saturday in advance of this year’s rally, Trump tweeted, “I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans.” The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans! But it’s not just Trump. Several Republican 2018 candidates have explicit ties to Unite the Right and the alt-right more generally, most notably GOP congressional candidate Corey Stewart, who has not only appeared at events with Kessler (and received his endorsement in the Virginia GOP primary) but employs a staffer who was taking part in planning for Unite the Right 2. And that’s not to mention that at least one failed GOP candidate, self-described Holocaust denier and anti-Semite Patrick Little, is already in attendance at Unite the Right 2-associated events, and another alt-right congressional candidate, Wisconsin’s Paul Nehlen, was on Kessler’s wish list of potential speakers. The Unite the Right 2-related activities have already kicked off in DC. Videos posted on Gab show neo-Nazi Patrick Little and former Phillies' ""Pistachio Girl"" Emily Youcis, who reinvented herself as a white nationalist, getting in arguments with people by the White House. In contrast, former Republican president candidate and current Senate candidate Mitt Romney shared a blog post on his campaign website on Saturday titled, “As I See It: Race and Equality,” in which he denounced Unite the Right 2 rallygoers and the alt-right (alongside Trump’s “both sides” rhetoric), adding: There are some besotted and misguided souls who long for a population that is more homogeneous — more white. They even disparage legal immigration, ignoring the fact that nearly all Americans are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. But can they not at least recognize — whether or not they like it — we are, in fact, a highly diverse population? And given this reality, “united we stand and divided we fall.” The equality of the intrinsic worth of every person is a truth fundamental to our national founding and moral order.

327,327,26-02-18 17:10,2018,2,26,Brian Resnick,Conspiracy theories flourished after the Parkland shooting. Here’s why.,"Last Wednesday, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was based on a lie. The video alleged that David Hogg, a 17-year-old survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, was an “actor.” After the shooting, Hogg had become a compelling and sympathetic proponent of gun control, making the rounds on cable news. This YouTube video contained a clip of Hogg speaking on camera for a Los Angeles local news segment last summer. The video was captioned “DAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....” — the implication being that Hogg suspiciously shows up whenever news cameras are rolling. YouTube took down the video and others like it — including one Infowars video headlined “David Hogg Can’t Remember His Lines in TV Interview.” But the video-sharing platform was hardly the only place similar conspiracy theories flourished, as Vox’s Matt Yglesias outlined. Right-wing celebrities suggest that George Soros was funding the anti-gun outcry. Elsewhere, outlets were pointing out that Hogg is the son of a retired FBI agent (the implication being that the FBI is out to get President Donald Trump). We’ve seen this before. After a tragedy, conspiracy theories emerge, and they are powerful, mean, and damaging. Consider the unending hurt of the parents of children slain during the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. For years, they have been charged with making up the whole tragedy (including the lives of their children). Or the agony of the family of Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer who was murdered in an apparent robbery attempt in 2016. Despite zero evidence, conspiracy theorists and conservative pundits fanned suspicions that Rich was murdered by the Clinton campaign. “Seth’s death has been turned into a political football,” Rich’s parents wrote at the Washington Post. Conspiracy theories are an infuriating plague on our media ecosystem. But they’re not inexplicable. We can understand why they spread so far and wide. Here are the two key reasons. When it comes to political debates, we don’t use our smarts to uncover the truth. We use our smarts to protect the groups and worldview to which we adhere. This is called politically motivated reasoning, and it distorts how we see the world. Asheley Landrum, a Texas Tech University psychologist who has studied conspiracy theorizing, suggests this might be what’s happening among those theorizing about the Parkland students. “To counteract the kids’ powerful speech, a conspiracy narrative arises that allows individuals to dismiss or ignore [the kids’ perspectives],” she writes in an email. Why would people want to counteract the kids? Well, because of where their pleas for greater gun control might lead: to greater gun control. And in the minds of right-wing conspiracy theorists, it’s easier to dismiss the kids outright than to actually engage with their arguments. Psychologists have found that people aren’t necessarily afraid of facts — they’re afraid of where those facts lead. This is called “solution aversion,” and it helps explain why many conservatives are wary of the science of climate change — because many solutions to climate change involve increasing government oversight and regulations. Similarly, right-wingers may be discrediting the kids because they don’t want to see changes to gun laws. One crucial thing to know about motivated reasoning is that you often don’t realize you’re doing it. We automatically have an easier time remembering information that fits our worldviews. We’re simply quicker to recognize information that confirms what we already know, which makes us blind to facts that discount it. Psychological research also finds that some people are just more prone to believing in conspiracy theories than others. And it’s not because these people are necessarily unintelligent (though being a more analytic person is correlated with being less swayed by conspiracies.) Instead, believing in conspiracy theories, psychological research informs us, is a coping mechanism to deal with uncertainty in the world. “It’s a self-protective mechanism people have,” Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist who studies conspiracy theories, told me last year. The theories are a tool by which people can feel more in control and find explanations in a scary and turbulent world. The thought of 17 kids being gunned down at school is horrible. Why wouldn’t we seek refuge in a theory that insists it wasn’t so bad after all? Van Prooijen expanded on what makes people more susceptible than others to believing in the theories: One of them is education level. Conspiracy theories are more likely among people who are [less] educated. But this doesn’t mean that people who are highly educated are immune. There’s also effects of political ideology. In our research, we find the more radical a person’s politics [both left- and right-wing], the more likely they are to be conspiracy theorists. Another is collective narcissism [a personality trait where people demand the group they belong to be admired], and people who believe their own nation and group is superior to others. People who feel powerless and who are more pessimistic are also more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, van Prooijen finds. And this is where education and outreach can help. Achieving higher levels of education correlates to feeling more secure about the world, and this, in turn, seems to protect against a conspiratorial mindset. Conspiracy theories aren’t new. But today they, fueled by computer algorithms that award grabbiness and not truth and deliberate misinformation campaigns, spread like wildfire. And the big tech giants are often hesitant or sluggish in taking them down. (After the shooting in Las Vegas in October, Google featured a link to an anonymous message board notorious for fueling conspiracy theories in its “top stories” module.) Plus, there are whole media outlets — like Infowars — that have built huge followings peddling junk theories. The theories are also dangerous because of a psychological phenomenon called the illusory truth effect. Its impact is subtle, but basically, it means that simply repeating a lie makes it more likely to be misidentified as truth. Each time a reader encounters a conspiracy theory on Facebook, Google, or really anywhere, it makes a subtle impression. Each time, the story grows more familiar, and that familiarity casts the illusion of truth. The more we hear a piece of information repeated, the more we’re likely to believe it. This is true for “even things that people have reason not to believe,” Gord Pennycook, a psychologist who studies misinformation at Yale University, told me last year. So consider this: When YouTube took down the conspiracy video last Wednesday, it had already been viewed 200,000 times.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/2/26/17045560/parkland-shooting-conspiracy-theories-psychology,,Vox
328,328,27-11-17 17:30,2017,11,27,Dylan Scott,Republicans are racing to pass their huge tax overhaul,"Republicans in Congress are keeping their tax plan moving right on schedule, with a quick-strike strategy and an uncanny knack for waving away the trade-offs that come with overhauling the nation’s tax code. House Republicans passed their tax bill exactly two weeks after detailed legislative text was released. Senate Republicans are now preparing to take up their own plan later this week, so long as they keep defections to a minimum. GOP leaders are cutting deals to keep 50 of their 52 members onboard and approve the tax legislation. The Washington Post reported on Monday that Republicans were weighing amendments to the tax treatment of “pass-through” businesses to win over the lone defector so far, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and to the bill’s overhaul of state and local tax deductions to keep other waving senators from opposing the bill. Plenty of pitfalls lie ahead. But the tax plan has yet to encounter any hurdle it can’t clear or any concerns Republicans can’t dismiss. The GOP’s top priority, after the failure of Obamacare repeal, is charging ahead on momentum alone. This is all in spite of the plan itself. Most Americans disapprove of the House and Senate proposals, according to new polling from Quinnipiac. Outside analyses have estimated that more than 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more by 2027 under the House bill. The Senate bill is projected to raise taxes on Americans making less than $30,000 a year starting in 2021. The Senate bill also includes a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which the CBO estimates will lead to 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance. In the House, Republicans from New York, New Jersey, and California could have banded together to block the bill because the elimination of state and local tax deductions acutely hurts their constituents. But they didn’t. The House bill never appeared to be in danger of failing. In the Senate, up next after the House passes their version, only Johnson has defected so far. Senate leaders are talking confidently about their ability to wrangle together a majority, even with their thin margin for error. Overriding any specific concern is the GOP’s desperate desire to secure a major legislative victory and a truncated public debate that has prevented any sustained resistance from taking hold. Sweeping tax changes, at least for now, appear to be happening. Republican leaders and the rank and file have portrayed passing a tax overhaul as an existential issue after the failure to repeal Obamacare, the party’s other longstanding campaign promise. “The way I see it, honestly, is we’ve got to get our job done,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said after this month’s Virginia elections, which many observers saw as an omen of a Democratic wave in 2018. “I think what people want to know and see is that this Donald Trump presidency and this Republican Congress makes a positive difference.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put it more plainly late last month as the tax debate debate was picking up. ""Well, I think all of us realize that if we fail on taxes, that's the end of the Republican Party's governing majority in 2018,"" he said. Congressional Republicans have been shockingly candid about their motivations, telling reporters that donors have said directly if the party fails on a tax overhaul, campaign contributions will dry up. ""My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don’t ever call me again,’” Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) said recently. To prevent a tax overhaul from suffering Obamacare repeal’s fate, Republicans have sought to move quickly and perfected their ability to disregard evidence from outside experts that their tax bill won’t achieve what they promised. The House bill was introduced on November 2, a markup in the House Ways and Means Committee started four days later, and within two weeks, Republicans were putting the plan on the House floor for a vote. The Senate bill moved equally fast. It was introduced on November 9, passed by the Senate Finance committee a week later and could be passed by the entire Senate less than three weeks after its introduction. Amid that mad dash, lawmakers are making big promises about the tax legislation, suggesting it could add tens of millions of jobs to the US economy. “If we can get 20 million people back to work, it’s going to be big,” Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) told Vox. The independent analyses have been less rosy. A Penn analysis projected that the House bill would add up to 0.83 percentage points to the economy’s growth in 2027. A Tax Policy Center estimate found that the individual tax cuts in the House plan would overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent a decade from now. And meanwhile, millions of US households would eventually see higher taxes, as the New York Times detailed. But that hasn’t deterred Republicans. They have simply insisted that every American would benefit, despite experts’ findings. “It lets every American keep more of what they earned,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said, a claim that PolitiFact rated false. By the same token, after months of promising revenue-neutral tax reform, both the House and Senate bills are projected to increase the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion. There, again, Republicans are simply dismissing the official findings, claiming that the economic growth spurred by the overhaul would erase any projected deficit growth. “I think this tax bill is going to reduce the size of our deficits going forward,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), one of the primary architects of the plan, told reporters last week. There has been nothing, so far, that can’t be explained away. Speed has helped Republicans keep their tax plans moving. The House bill went from introduction to passage in two weeks. The Senate bill is on a similarly accelerated timeline. This is not the months-long debate that helped derail the Obamacare repeal crusade. But ironically, health care could end up being the biggest hurdle lying ahead for Republicans, particularly in the Senate, where 50 of the 52 Republican senators must back the tax plan. They’ve already lost one for the time being, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who isn’t satisfied with the changes for small firms that are taxed as individuals, known as “pass-throughs.” Two more defectors would sink the current bill. Now the Senate has added the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to its tax legislation, a provision that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would lead to 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance by 2027 and a 10 percent increase in premiums. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who both voted down a health care plan this summer that did little more than repeal the mandate, expressed their reservations about mixing health care with taxes after the change was announced. “Tax reform is complicated enough, and when you add health care reform in at the same time, it continues to complicate it,” Murkowski told reporters. But neither of them has committed to voting against the tax plan over the issue either. Murkowski in particular has a big reason to vote for the tax bill: It would also open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for more oil and gas drilling, a longstanding goal of Alaska politicians. Collins is also the target of last-minute changes to state and local tax deductions, according to the Post. Other possible defectors — like Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who are worried about the federal deficit — are still on the fence too. Corker aides sounded optimistic on Monday that their boss will ultimately be able to support the final bill. Corker staff says he has worked over break with admin and senators to get tax bill changed. ""While more work remains, all parties are hopeful that the final bill will be good for our country.” One final wild card will be Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who has at times been fixated on bipartisanship and regular order. He already showed in the health care debate that he is willing to buck the party if he isn’t satisfied with the product or process. But with Obamacare repeal, it was easy to identify as many as a dozen “no” votes at times. The tax bill also has to thread a narrow needle, but Senate Republican leaders have thus far prevented a critical mass of their conference from jumping ship. Even Johnson, who also blanched at the health care bills periodically, could still be won over. If both chambers do pass a tax bill, they will still have to reconcile their differences. Touchy issues like the state and local tax deduction and Obamacare repeal could complicate those conference negotiations. But over the course of two weeks, congressional Republicans have set themselves to get this win. Their dreams of passing a major tax bill by the end of the year suddenly don’t seem so farfetched.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/16/16665348/house-republican-tax-bill-vote-speed,,Vox
329,329,08-07-18 14:54,2018,7,8,Emily Stewart,Maxine Waters could be a problem for Trump if Democrats win the House,"If President Donald Trump doesn’t like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), he really won’t like her if Democrats take back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. The California Democrat is poised to take over the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats are in the majority, and such a position, she could wield a lot of power. There are already some hints about how Waters could use that perch to probe the scandals and conflicts of interest swirling around the Trump administration. Waters is currently the ranking member of the committee, which is charged with overseeing the financial services industry, including banks, insurers, and housing. As ranking member, she’s pushed for probes into the financial ties of Trump and those around him, including his relationship with Deutsche Bank and, perhaps, Russia. Her hands have been tied on taking action because she’s not chair, but if Democrats take the House and she is, that changes. She’ll have the ability to issue subpoenas, call hearings, and request depositions, including regarding the money trails surrounding Trump. “Maxine Waters is one of the leading voices of the Democratic Party, and the tone, tenor, and tenacity of the House Financial Services Committee chairmanship is going to change next year materially [if Democrats win],” Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at research firm Compass Point, told me. “It’s been a little bit of a sleepy committee for the last few years, but that’s going to change if Rep. Waters gets the gavel.” Waters is 14-term House member who represents California’s 43rd Congressional District, which covers part of Los Angeles. Since Trump was elected, she has positioned herself as a fierce Trump critic: She refused to attend his inauguration and boycotted his State of the Union address, and she’s repeatedly called for his removal from office. At Glamour magazine’s Women of the Year awards in November, she led attendees in a chant of “Impeach 45!” Recently, she’s been in the headlines for urging her supporters to “push back” against Trump administration officials in public, telling them to confront Cabinet members and others to let them know “they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” Waters said she received death threats after her remarks, and last week, she canceled a pair of appearances in Alabama and Texas out of caution. But she’s remained defiant. At a Families Belong Together rally over the weekend, she criticized the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policies that resulted in family separation. She also called for Trump’s impeachment and challenged those making threats against her. “If you shoot me, you better shoot straight,” she said at a Families Belong Together rally in Los Angeles. “There’s nothing like a wounded animal.” Waters faced backlash over her comments about protesting Trump officials, including criticism from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). Trump falsely claimed on Twitter she called for harming his supporters. (She did not.) Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! Despite the criticism, Democrats are sticking by Waters as their top candidate to run the Financial Services Committee should they take back the House in November. And there, she would have a lot of power. As ranking member, Waters has pushed for more information on Trump and Deutsche Bank. The German bank is one of the few banks that still lends money to Trump after his multiple bankruptcies and financial woes. It’s also done deals with the president’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. It made a $285 million loan to him just a month before the 2016 election. Waters has also pressed for details on Trump’s deals with Russia. In May 2017, Waters sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking him for information on Trump’s financial ties with Russia. She has written multiple letters to Deutsche Bank asking about its Trump ties and in August 2017 asked House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) to subpoena them. She and other committee Democrats also introduced a resolution of inquiry to “follow the Trump money trail” last year. Because the minority party doesn’t have subpoena power, Maxine hasn’t been able to do much beyond writing letters. But if Democrats are in the majority, that changes. Boltansky, the analyst, said he would expect multiple subpoenas, hearings, and other efforts to get information about and draw attention to Trump’s financial dealings with Waters in charge. “She’s interested in Deutsche Bank’s relationship to Trump, in Citigroup’s relationship to the Kushner family, and how all of the different activities of the Trump administration have a bearing on public policy,” he said. Her number one power is the hearing, he added, because “hearings with big names bring cameras, and that elevates an issue immediately.” It is worth noting that special counsel Robert Mueller also reportedly subpoenaed Deutsche Banks for what it has on Trump or his associates. The White House is also probing Kushner’s loans from Citibank. “Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy, and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair,” Waters said in an emailed statement. “I am committed to ensuring that hardworking Americans and our nation’s small businesses have opportunities to thrive, expanding and supporting affordable housing opportunities for our nation’s families, making sure that the safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis, protecting consumers and investors from bad actors, and conducting appropriate oversight of the administration and the regulatory agencies under the committee’s jurisdiction.” Unless Democrats take back the Senate as well, which isn’t expected to happen, most of the legislation Democrats pass in the House, including from Rep. Waters out of the House Financial Services Committee, is unlikely to become law. But she can still propose bills and sponsor legislation. Beyond an aggressive oversight agenda, Waters is likely to focus on key messaging issues with legislative proposals — items such as economic inequality and financial industry regulation. This Congress, she has introduced 15 financial services bills so far, including one that would shut down banks that repeatedly harm consumers, another to improve public housing, and another to overhaul credit reporting. By next year, the whole financial regulatory regime will be led by Trump appointees. Waters won’t be able to put a stop to Trump’s deregulatory push, but she could slow it with hearings, letters, and public attention, Boltansky said. Waters is also expected to focus on embattled megabank Wells Fargo. Last year, she issued a 38-report on the bank and called for it to be shut down entirely. “When a megabank has engaged in a pattern of extensive violations of law that harms millions of consumers, like Wells Fargo has, it should not be allowed to continue to operate within our nation’s banking system, and avail itself of all of the associated privileges afforded to it,” the report read. She also secured a hearing on the Equifax data breach last year, and there could certainly be more of that. Waters is not without baggage of her own, including on the financial front. She previously faced scrutiny over her role in pushing for a bailout for a bank tied to her family, the Daily Beast points out. An ethics investigation cleared her, but it did find wrongdoing by her then-chief of staff and grandson, and there have been other questions raised about whether members of her family have profited from her position. In 2011, watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) named Waters one of the most corrupt politicians. Waters, 79, has for years been an outspoken member of the House, but in the era of Trump, her voice has grown much louder, or at least it’s gotten a lot more attention. A video of her declaring, “Reclaiming my time,” at a 2017 Congressional hearing went viral on the internet, and President Trump has made a habit out of targeting her in his attacks. The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres. Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats! If Democrats take back the House in November, and Waters takes over the House Financial Services Committee, as expected, you can expect a lot more Maxine Waters headlines, Trump tweets, and memes. Update: Story has been updated to clarify that Waters will likely be able to pass legislation out of the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take back the House. If Republicans hold the Senate, it will be unlikely to become law.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/5/17527738/maxine-waters-trump-deutsche-bank,,Vox
330,330,06-08-18 20:30,2018,8,6,Alexia Fernández Campbell,Americans want paid maternity leave. The Rubio-Ivanka plan will hurt Social Security.,"The Senate went on summer break this week, after a lame attempt to give working parents some relief. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Economic Security Act for New Parents last week, with support from White House adviser Ivanka Trump. The full text of the bill hasn’t been released, but it’s been sold as providing parents with “paid parental leave” after the birth or adoption of a child. The bill is not, in fact, paid leave. It’s another version of unpaid leave that working parents in the United States would have to pay for themselves. A summary of the bill shows that it would merely let workers access some of their Social Security retirement income in advance to make up for some of the wages they would lose when taking parental leave. Workers would still bear the cost of taking time off — by delaying their own retirement. The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t guarantee paid parental leave to working parents, and Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly support the creation of such a program. The problem is that no one seems to agree on how to pay for it, and Rubio’s bill is the weakest proposal yet because Social Security, as it stands, is in trouble. The idea of a government-run program to provide maternity and paternity leave to new parents is not controversial. About 74 percent of registered US voters in 2016 said they wanted the government to do so. When you break down the numbers, the support is overwhelming across genders, political parties, and even income groups. In other words, it’s a safe political issue for Republicans to tackle, if only they weren’t so afraid to make businesses pay part of the cost. Nearly every industrialized country in the world provides working mothers with at least three months of paid maternity leave — the minimum recommended by the United Nations’ International Labour Organization. In most of those countries, employers and employees pay a tax to fund the benefit. Canada has this type of system, which allows parents to take a year of leave while receiving 55 percent of their salary (up to 80 percent of wages are covered for low-income workers). Some US businesses voluntarily offer paid parental leave to their workers, but only about one in 10 workers in the country get such a benefit from their employer. Low-wage workers are the least likely to get it. In response to federal inaction on the issue, several states have started requiring employers to provide some paid leave: California, New York, and the District of Columbia are among those that do. Research shows that paid leave programs improve child health, promote gender equality, and help keep women in the workforce. Studies have shown that California’s paid-leave law, which went into effect in 2004, led to an increase in work hours and income for mothers with young children. Studies have also shown that paid leave is linked to lower poverty rates in 18 countries. The need for paid leave in the United States is more urgent than ever, as nearly half of two-parent US households with children have parents who both work full-time jobs. Economists believe the lack of paid leave is one reason American women are dropping out of the labor force, and that’s bad news for the US economy. About 75 percent of working-age women are part of the US workforce, reflecting a slow decline since 2000, when 77 percent held jobs. Economists have various theories for the decline, including the shrinking job market for low-skilled workers and the growing cost of child care. When women joined the public labor force en masse in the 1970s, their earnings were a huge boost to the US economy, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama. They attributed nearly all of the middle-class income growth since 1970 to the rise of women entering the US workforce. But female participation in the job market began to flatten out in the 1990s and is now declining, even though it continues to increase in other developed countries. Nearly a third of the decline of American women in the labor force, in comparison to other developed countries, can be explained by the lack of family-friendly workplace policies in the United States, including paid leave for new parents, according to research by economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn at Cornell University. Coming up with an effective paid parental leave system in the United States isn’t hard. The hard part is getting Republicans to agree that businesses should pay for some of it. Which is how we got to Rubio’s shortsighted plan. There are few details about Rubio’s paid leave plan. But here is what we know about it: New parents would dip into their Social Security retirement benefits to cover part of the cost of taking time off from work. Through the plan, up to 70 percent of their wages would be covered for two months of leave. However, that would mean delaying their retirement payments through Social Security at least three to six months per child. The benefit is not available for other types of paid leave, such as workers who need to take time off to care for a sick relative. So Rubio’s “paid leave” program is essentially unpaid, at least by employers, since workers are the ones paying for their own time off. Employers pay nothing, and neither does the federal government. Even worse, the plan doesn’t take into account the fact that the future of Social Security is in jeopardy. The system is running a deficit for the first time in more than 30 years, and the Social Security Administration expects that it will run out of money to pay workers their full retirement benefits by 2035. Allowing workers to take more money from the system will only make the problem worse. There are better options out there. A group of influential conservative and liberal economists proposed one not-so-ideal option last year: pay for parental leave by increasing payroll taxes on workers, and through other savings in the federal budget. The downside is that the plan still lets businesses off the hook from shouldering any of the cost. Sharing the cost between employees and businesses seem obvious. That’s how most workers’ insurance programs operate, and that’s how most paid parental leave programs across the world work. Businesses should share the burden of paying for the program because they benefit from paid leave too. Female employees are more likely to return to their jobs after giving birth, keeping more workers in the labor force for employers to hire when the economy is growing (like it is now). An even broader option is some version of the FAMILY Act, which Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced in 2017. The bill offers workers up to 12 weeks off with up to 66 percent of their wages covered for family and medical leave. The benefit would be paid for with a tax levied on workers and employers (about 2 cents each for every $10 paid in wages). And the plan is flexible so that it benefits all employees, not just parents. That’s because it would be available to any worker who needs to take time off to care for a relative, or for a medical procedure. The bill has more than 30 Democratic co-sponsors, but no Republican lawmakers will touch it.",https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17648462/rubio-ivanka-republican-paid-leave,,Vox

332,332,17-11-16 20:45,2016,11,17,Matthew Yglesias,Tim Ryan is going to challenge Nancy Pelosi to lead House Democrats,"Younger members of the House Democratic caucus wanted to delay leadership elections to see if a strong challenger to Nancy Pelosi would emerge, and lo and behold, one has — Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Ryan is a 43-year-old white man from Youngstown who represents a somewhat squiggly-looking congressional district that includes large numbers of African Americans and working-class white voters. His political profile leans toward populism on economic issues — especially trade — but he is more on the moderate side of things in terms of environmental and social issues. He first entered the House in 2003 and has been pro-life for most of his political career. But in January 2015 he announced a conversion to the pro-choice viewpoint in what most people saw as an effort to position himself as a possible vice presidential candidate. Ryan definitely represents most Washington Democrats’ idea of what it would mean to position the party more favorably to succeed in Rust Belt states. It’s an idea that certainly has similarities with what Bernie Sanders’s internet fan base thinks Democrats should do. But Ryan — like Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown — is much less consistently liberal than Sanders, while maintaining a Sanders-ish skepticism of trade and Wall Street. Democrats very much wanted Ryan to be their nominee for the 2016 Senate race. But he declined to get in, so the party instead ran former Gov. Ted Strickland, who got crushed. Given how strong Donald Trump proved to be in the state, Ryan almost certainly would have been crushed too, so his decision to opt out seems savvy. There is a strong sentiment among a number of House backbenchers that the party would do well to replace Pelosi, simply for the sake of presenting a fresh face to voters in 2018. And on paper, a middle-aged white male Midwesterner with a history of moderation on social issues sounds like a better face to put forward in Republican-leaning districts in the midterms than an older woman from San Francisco who’s very much identified with environmentalism and social liberals. On the other hand, the energy in the Democratic Party is all on the left right now. And though there is a populist side to Ryan, it’s far from clear that he would really pass muster with the party’s left wing. But during the 2016 campaign, Ryan did offer the kind of muscular, economics-based critique of Donald Trump that many Democrats in retrospect wish Clinton had offered. Speaking at a rally in Youngstown in October, Ryan dwelled on Trump’s habit of not paying his subcontractors and said, “I don’t mean to be graphic, but this guy to our friends in the trades — to our steelworkers who he’s been treating unfairly, very unfairly — he will, he will gut you and he will walk over your cold dead body and he won’t even flinch.” Even if Ryan loses, however, a leadership run could help his career. Both Pelosi and her deputy in the Democratic leadership hierarchy, Steny Hoyer, are on the older side and won’t be around for long one way or the other. Right now relatively few House members are well-known enough to be strong future leadership candidates. A run at Pelosi could help Ryan build up his profile and position himself for later.",https://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13670294/tim-ryan-house-democrats,,Vox

334,334,28-09-16 23:00,2016,9,28,Javier Cabral,This Mezcal Company Thinks Donald Trump Is a 'Pendejo',"This story was originally published in November, 2015.  Is there anything better in this crazy, fucked-up world than sipping on a glass of smooth mezcal? How about if you are quietly sticking it to Donald Trump and everything he stands for at the same time? John Rexer, the founder of Ilegal Mezcal, certainly doesn't think so, and he's willing to let the whole world know that neither he nor his mezcal are going to stand for right-wing anti-immigrant rhetoric. In July, his company launched a guerrilla smear campaign against the Republican candidate, wheat-pasting thousands of anti-Trump posters all over New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oaxaca. The posters simply read ""Donald Eres Un Pendejo""—""Donald, You're an Asshole""—alongside a silhouette of the most infamous hair in politics. When Trump recently hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live, the small-scale mezcal company stepped up its tactics and projected the ""pendejo"" image all over the Rockefeller Center and Union Square in New York. MUNCHIES caught up with Rexer to find out how his campaign is going, and why he decided to use his mezcal brand as a political tool against Trump. MUNCHIES: Before we dive into politics, tell me a little bit about your mezcal. John Rexer: For starters, you get a mouthful of agave with only a little bit of smoke with our mezcal. This, along with the fact that we are one of only two brands which are aging mezcales into reposados and añejos, distinguishes our mezcal from a lot of other ones. Also, with us, it is all about sustainability. We're not the type of mezcal company who ""gives back"" after we make a lot of money. If you tend to your own garden and take care of it [from] the start, giving back is not always necessary, especially if you start out the right way. We pay above-market rate to all of our producers for everything, and we personally see to it that it passes on to their workers and their families. Lastly, we pay our producers up front, instead of paying in 60 to 90 days like a lot of other mezcal brands. It's a really nice way to work. What was the exact a-ha! moment that made you realize ""Donald, eres un pendejo"" would be your next slogan? I was in New York and I had just come from Mexico. I was in Jackson Hole in the Upper West Side, having a really hungover brunch. I was sitting outside and saw a delivery server on a bicycle. I said to the person next to me, I bet you they are from Puebla or Oaxaca. So when the server came over I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said, ""Puebla."" We then talked about the beauty of Puebla, since I used to live in the outskirts there and it is such a cool state in Mexico. I also told him how I love the food of Puebla. The server turned to me and said, ""Man, it's good to know that everybody is not like Donald Trump."" You [could] see some real hurt in his face when he said that. I told him, ""Listen, everybody is not like Donald and most people don't feel the way he feels."" So he responded, ""Donald es un pendejo."" That moved me and I wrote it down in a napkin. I then thought that there are probably a lot of other people in New York, Oaxaca, and the US who are probably feeling the same way and are hurt by him. The next morning, I opened up my wallet and the crumpled napkin fell out. That was when it hit me: These words exactly were going to be our next campaign. I just wanted to voice the sentiment of many of the hardworking people who work with me from all over Mexico. Three days later, we had at least 1,000 posters plastered all over New York City alone. We've since branched out our campaign to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and Oaxaca. And we're not quite done yet. I think we just hit our 2,000-poster count today. How was the general reaction to the posters from people? Most people have responded with a ""fuck yeah"" attitude—like thousands of people. One or two people have questioned our motive. Let's be really clear: It is publicity and I did use company money for this. On the other hand, let's also be really clear: This is something that we believe in. We strongly believe in the power of art and humor as protest. Especially with somebody like Trump, we take issue with him entirely. We take an issue with his entire xenophobic, money-dominated worldview. Is this Ilegal Mezcal's first foray into activism?  We've always been political. This brand started out of this bar in Guatemala, where I live. I've published a political magazine out of there, long before this. We've always been about making a crosscultural stand and movement. . A couple of years ago, we did a protest against Chick-fil-A and did stencil art to protest them when [they] came out against marriage equality. We created this stencil, which depicted two roosters kissing each other, with the phrase, ""I'd rather kiss a cock than eat your chicken."" We spraypainted that all over over New York. Have you heard anything from Trump or his people?  We have not heard back. But we did get kicked out by the police when my brand director and niece, Kayla Rexer, projected this image on Rockefeller Center the day he hosted Saturday Night Live. What was that like?  We went early and we joined around 200 protesters. We continued to project our billboard-sized image for 30 minutes until the cops found out about us and gave us a warning. After we got kicked out, we went on to project the image at Union Square and the CNN building. Do you have any words for him, just in case he's reading this?  Take a shot and chill out. Building walls and blocking out people is not the way to look at the immigration issue. How about your provide an intelligent dialogue instead? This is more appropriate for anyone who wants to be a leader of a country. Also, just just go away. Thanks for speaking with me.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xbnkd/this-mezcal-company-thinks-donald-trump-is-a-pendejo,Food by VICE ,Vice

336,336,02-11-18 22:50,2018,11,2,Nadra Nittle,China’s social credit system penalizes those who spend “frivolously”,"In 2020, China will fully roll out its controversial social credit score. Under the system, both financial behaviors like “frivolous spending” and bad behaviors like lighting up in smoke-free zones can result in stiff consequences. Penalties include loss of employment and educational opportunities, as well as transportation restrictions. Those with high scores get perks, like discounts on utility bills and faster application processes to travel abroad. China is currently piloting the program and some citizens have already found themselves banned from traveling or attending certain schools due to low scores. These ramifications have led to a flurry of recent criticism from both human rights groups and the press. This week alone, news outlets like Business Insider and National Public Radio weighed in on China’s social credit score and the stratified society it may foster in the communist country. The outcry about China’s social credit score is understandable, given that the country’s authoritarian regime leaves citizens with little recourse to challenge the new system. But concerns about China’s credit system have overlooked how the US system also divides consumers along class lines — and has done so for decades. Social behaviors may not factor into US credit scores, but the idea that a person’s financial history reflects trustworthiness has long influenced employment decisions and other factors that affect Americans’ quality-of-life. China first announced that it would be devising a “social credit score” in 2014. The government said then that the system would help ensure a model society in which “sincerity and trustworthiness become conscious norms of action among all the people.” According to NPR, the fact that most Chinese people don’t have bank accounts or credit histories likely spurred the government to create a credit system of some sort. Every citizen starts off with a score of 1,000. NPR reported the ranking as follows: 960 to 1,000 is an A; 850 to 955 points is a B; 840 to 600 is a C; and any score below that is a D, which designates the score-holder as “untrustworthy.” While the government hasn’t made the specific methodology used to calculate scores public, one’s ranking can fall for both major and minor infractions. Serious violations include drunk-driving, embezzlement, and fraud. Much smaller violations that result in a lowered score include playing too many video games; spreading “fake news,” especially related to terrorist attacks, or refusing military service, will also lower one’s score. Sometimes people are declared “dishonest” for committing infractions the government doesn’t believe they’re truly sorry for. Chinese lawyer Li Xiaolin found himself in this predicament last year, according to Human Rights Watch: “He tried to use his national identity card to purchase a plane ticket. To his surprise, the online system rejected it, saying he had been blacklisted by China’s top court. Mr. Li checked the court’s website: His name was on a list of ‘untrustworthy’ people.” The courts are supposed to warn citizens before they’re added to the blacklist, allowing them 10 days to appeal the designation, but Li said he was caught by surprise. He was blacklisted for losing a defamation suit that was brought against him; he wrote an apology letter to the court as a means of making amends, and said he didn’t know that the court rejected his apology until the travel mishap. Ultimately, he had to apologize to the government again to be removed from the travel blacklist. “Chinese government authorities clearly hope to create a reality in which bureaucratic pettiness could significantly limit people’s rights,” explains Human Rights Watch. “As President Xi Jinping’s power grows, and as the system approaches full implementation, more abuses will come.” The social credit score has been compared to the “Nosedive” episode of Netflix’s Black Mirror in which everyone receives a social ranking determined by peers. It has also drawn comparisons to the dystopian novel 1984. For those declared “untrustworthy,” the ability to buy business-class train tickets or to lodge at certain hotels can be rescinded. In some cases, the opportunity for their children to attend their preferred high school or college may be taken away, as may employment opportunities. (The government encourages employers to consult the blacklist before making hiring decisions.) Citizens who behave inconsiderately in public, like walking their dogs off-leash, can have their dogs confiscated and be required to take an exam to get the pets back. Although “untrustworthy” people are punished for bad scores, citizens who rank the highest in the new system can take advantage of perks like business discounts or booking hotel rooms without deposits. “Under the system, the elite will gain access to better social privileges and those who rank closer to the bottom will effectively be second-class citizens,” Newsweek reported about the social credit score. In the United States, the credit bureaus don’t downgrade consumers for spending on things they deem silly or for being neglectful pet owners. But credit rankings in the US are set up in such a way that people with more resources get more financial breaks while people with fewer resources are routinely punished — often in ways that make little sense. A person may end up with bad credit because he lost his job, but the fact that his credit suffered while unemployed could effectively prevent him from landing another job. According to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it is not illegal for employers to deny an applicant a job offer based on information in his credit report. This makes it that much harder for people with bad credit to get the gainful employment needed to repair their scores. People with poor credit may also be turned down for housing, even if the reason for the would-be tenant’s troublesome credit history has nothing to do with her rental history. Someone who consistently paid rent on time but racked up credit card debt due to medical expenses could find her housing application denied or be asked to pay a higher deposit as punishment. By some estimates, one in five Americans has unpaid medical debt, and more than half of blacks and Latinos have medical debt on their credit cards. This not only limits rental opportunities but opportunities to buy a home, as good credit is generally a requirement for a housing loan. And lenders, of course, have historically created barriers for people of color pursuing homeownership. Transportation and credit aren’t just linked in China but in the US too. Americans with bad credit pay more for car insurance than their counterparts with good credit. Some banks have systematically given people of color subprime auto loans, even if their credit history didn’t justify that they pay more interest. “Credit reports and scores are mirrors of our manifestly two-tiered financial system, and more broadly our system of racial wealth inequality and unequal opportunity,” Sarah Ludwig, founder and co-director of the New Economy Project wrote in a 2015 Guardian essay. “In our culture, indebtedness — and certainly failure to pay one’s debts — is deeply entwined with concepts of morality. The insidious notion that our credit history speaks to our reliability as human beings is largely taken for granted.” The 2019 debut of the UltraFICO score, an alternative to the traditional FICO credit score, is being touted as a potential remedy for the inequities in the US credit system. Rather than focus on length of credit history, for example, it takes into consideration whether one saves regularly, maintains a $400 bank balance, avoids overdrafts, and pays bills on time. But this alternative isn’t likely to benefit the low-income people who have to juggle bills to survive, perhaps paying the heating bill late one month and the car insurance late the next. For truly cash-poor families, regularly saving money or avoiding overdraft fees is a Herculean task. In fact, many poor people forgo bank accounts altogether because banking fees take such a toll on their finances. UltraFico might help people of average means with short credit histories, but it’s questionable if the score will change circumstances for the underprivileged. Given how interlinked morality, debt, and credit are in the United States, some of the concerns about China’s new social credit score comes across as disingenuous. Although the system certainly raises alarms — Human Rights Watch is concerned about it, after all — the idea that the US credit system operates much more equitably is shortsighted.

337,337,30-10-17 00:00,2017,10,30,Mary Pelletier,The Istanbul Biennial Examines the Tricky Question of What Makes a “Good Neighbor”,"Dealing with themes of surveillance, personal and shared space, and what defines home in film, installation, and more. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In the months leading up to the 15th edition of the Istanbul Biennial, posters —hung in windows alongside “For Rent” signs and pasted next to broadsides advertising concerts — began asking the city’s residents some very personal questions: Is a good neighbor someone you rarely see? Is a good neighbor richer or poorer than you? Is a good neighbor willing to babysit your 5-year-old?  Part introspective canvassing, part marketing campaign, 40 individual questions galvanized Elmgreen & Dragset’s theme for the 2017 edition: What makes a good neighbor? The Scandinavian artist duo (the Biennial’s first artist-curators) decided to approach this edition with broad notions of community and its many trappings: neighbors, borders, politics — even how we formulate our own homes. 55 artists were selected to exhibit across six venues (which, unlike the Biennial’s last edition, are each within neighborly walking distance), responding however they saw fit.   Of course, there are no right answers to these questions; still, many successful artworks in the Biennial bear out personal, global, and political identities, tackling what it means to be part (or, not part) of a community in myriad ways and media. Here are three of the questions posed by Elmgreen & Dragset, and a selection of Biennial artworks that probe them with possible “answers.”  Is a good neighbor a stranger you don’t fear? Security and surveillance play an introductory role in the biennial — as is now common practice at art institutions across the world, it is unsurprising that the first thing to greet you at any given venue is a security guard, sometimes followed by a metal detector or x-ray. Turkish ceramicist Burçak Bingöl has brilliantly intervened in daily acts of surveillance by installing ceramic CCTV cameras amidst the venues’ actual cameras in “Follower 2017.” Bedecked with local flora beneath a sheen of glaze, they are a subtle wink to those who look up and spot them — and a reminder that, as you ponder her ornamental additions, someone is most likely inspecting your image on a screen nearby. At the Galata Greek Primary School, Lungiswa Gqunta’s “Lawn I” (2016/2017) is a tightly packed grid of jagged, overturned Coke bottles, filled with a neon green petrol. Taking up most of an old classroom, “Lawn I” comments on the outdoor leisure areas of her native South Africa — reserved for the wealthy, suburban elites, the garden becomes a realm of disparity between residential populations. Shards of glass often top the fencing that keeps “strangers” out of these gardens— here the glass and its threatening edges form the basis of a charge piece of oft-disputed property, and visitors tread lightly, navigating ideas of neighborhood. In a room at Istanbul Modern, Candeğer Furtun’s “Untitled” (1994-96), confronts visitors with a line of naked, male legs, sat body-less, on a span of tiles. Immediately, you’re in a hammam, nine identity-less men sat side by side,  and one ceramic hand placed firmly (aggressively?) on a thigh. It’s at once impersonal and intimate, and we are left wondering how these figures may relate to one another, and how masculinity operates in their world — it’s no accident that there are nine figures here, representing Turkey and its eight regional neighbors. Is a good neighbor just some shadows cast on the rolled down blinds next door?  Over at Ark Kultur, Mahmoud Khaled’s “Proposal for a House Museum of an Unknown Crying Man” (2017) introduces a neighborhood stranger — the “unknown crying man.” The entire cultural space has been transformed into his home, and an audio guide illuminates the life of its sole inhabitant: one of the 52 Egyptian men arrested on a gay party boat floating down the Nile in 2001.  Here, Khaled re-imagines the future of one of these men, in Istanbul, through an incredibly detailed assemblage of furniture, books, magazines, and photographs, many of which speak to his queer identity, and hint at the personal reasoning behind his somewhat reclusive life. In the glass shower room, the only place neighbors could catch a glimpse of the crying man, scenes from the Egyptian film All My Life (dir. Maher Sabry, 2008), loops continuously on a television screen, showing the story of a gay man’s arrest; in his study, a selection of queer literature is stacked alongside the daybed. Though homosexuality is not illegal in Turkey, the house tour is a powerful and painfully personal study of continued persecution in the region — even in the crying man’s new home. Is a good neighbor tuned in to the same channel as you, watching from a sofa almost like yours, bought from a similar chain store? Tucked away in an apartment building, Yoğunluk’s Artist Atelier is the smallest of the Biennial’s six venues, showcasing “The House” (2017). Only three or four visitors can enter the darkened space at a time, and soon, the darkness give ways to soft illuminations of typical homewares. The building, some 100 years old, provides its own creaky soundtrack, and gives off a haunted house vibe, enhanced by the sticky counters, tables, and chairs, all covered in a film of sweaty latex. Surreal and familiar at the same time, the quiet, four-minute experience forces us to ponder the atelier’s question: “How do you figure out that somewhere is a house?” At Istanbul Modern, Volkan Aslan’s three-channel film, “Home Sweet Home” (2017), is a quietly beautiful meditation on personal and shared space, which takes place on the Bosphorus. To the left, woman moves about a cosy, compact living area: repotting a plant, filling a water glass, rolling a cigarette. To the right, a woman sits on the deck of a boat, taking her coffee at a desk firmly planted onboard. In the middle, rolling shots of the river link the two, but it’s not until the film nears its end that we see these two women share a single houseboat. It’s a play with forced perspective that confounds distance, and, after viewers are done chuckling at their own assumptions, leaves space to muse on the way distance functions within relationships, inside and outside the home. The 15th Istanbul Biennial continues through November 12.  ",https://hyperallergic.com/408411/the-istanbul-biennial-examines-the-tricky-question-of-what-makes-a-good-neighbor/,,Hyperallergic
338,338,22-01-19 23:30,2019,1,22,Alexia Fernández Campbell,LA teachers strike: teachers and city leaders reach tentative deal,"Los Angeles public school teachers have reached a tentative deal with city leaders to end a strike that has shut down the nation’s second-largest school district for more than a week. As part of the deal, teachers would get a 6 percent raise and slightly fewer students in each classroom, according to Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, a labor union that represents about 34,000 public school teachers, nurses, librarians, and support staff in the city. “We have seen over the last week something pretty amazing happen,” Caputo-Pearl said at a press conference Tuesday morning at City Hall. “The creativity, innovation, passion, and love and emotion of our members was out on the street for everyone to see.” He was joined at the press conference by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and District Superintendent Austin Beutner. The group said they reached a deal after an all-night negotiating session that ended at 6:15 am. The deal includes hiring more nurses, guidance counselors, librarians, and support staff. The district will also try to limit the expansion of charters schools and will reevaluate testing requirements. Union members still need to vote on the contract before ending their strike, which has now lasted six days. If union and school board members ratify the contract, classes will resume on Wednesday and more than 600,000 students can return to school. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the agreement a “paradigm shift.” “For the first time in recent memory, the conversation has focused on how to fund our schools so students have the support they need,” Weingarten told me. The deal follows a week of tense negotiating between teachers and school officials, who felt added pressure as the strike gained national — and even international — attention. Teachers pointed out that California is one of the wealthiest states in the country but ranks toward the bottom in how much money it invests per student. It’s unclear how much more money the state plans to funnel to its largest school district, but the strike certainly pushed local and state officials to hustle. “The strike was painful and it had a cost, but it helped,” Garcetti said during Tuesday’s press conference. The strike’s success adds new momentum to a national movement to boost investment in public education. Frustration over stagnant teacher wages, crumbling infrastructure, and deep budget cuts to education fueled a wave of teacher protests in conservative states in 2018. Educators went on strike in Arizona, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma, forcing state lawmakers to raise their pay and spend more on schools. The strike in Los Angeles suggests that the movement is expanding beyond the red states where it began, and could lead more progressive states to reexamine their investment in public education too. With 640,000 students, Los Angeles has the second-largest school district in the US (behind only New York City). Much of the student population is poor and underserved — about 80 percent of kids qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Yet California is among the states that spend the least on each student (adjusted for the cost of living), largely because of the state’s strict limits on property tax rates. Union leaders and school district officials had spent more than a year negotiating a new contract but made little progress. Beutner, the school district’s superintendent, repeatedly blasted union leaders for trying “bankrupt” the city with its expensive proposals. The teachers union has demanded a number of changes, including smaller class sizes; limited standardized testing; more support staff, such as nurses, librarians, and academic counselors; and a 6.5 percent salary increase. The union also wants the state to limit the expansion of public charter schools — privately run schools that receive state funding but are subject to fewer regulations. Negotiations stalled even after teachers, nurses, and librarians voted in August to authorize a strike. It wasn’t until teachers walked out of class last week, shutting down every public school in the city, that talks began to move forward. On Thursday, Gavin Newsom, California’s new Democratic governor, proposed a $209 billion budget that would increase school spending; school district officials also agreed to make some changes to classroom sizes and teacher salaries. Union leaders rejected the offer on Friday, calling it “woefully inadequate.” After spending the weekend back at the negotiating table, there was a breakthrough. On the surface, the deal appears to address most of the teachers’ concerns, though class sizes will only shrink by about four students — one each year for the next four years. The city’s middle and high school teachers currently have an average of 32 students in each classroom, double the national average. During the press conference, Garcetti described the deal as “historic,” while the schools superintendent struck a more cautious tone. “We can’t solve 40 years of underinvestment in education in one week or one contract,” Beutner said. Teachers and other union members are expected to vote Tuesday to approve the contract. If it fails, they go back to the table to strike another deal. If it passes, and the school board approves it, teachers will go back to work Wednesday.",https://www.vox.com/2019/1/22/18193145/la-teachers-strike-deal,,Vox

Facebook censored Evelyne Axell’s 1964 painting “Ice Cream” for “containing excessive amounts of skin or suggestive content” after the Philadelphia Museum of Art used it to promote the forthcoming exhibition International Pop on the social network. A badger dug up several artifacts dating from between 2000 and 2200 BCE on Ministry of Defense property near Stonehenge. Ann Freedman and the Knoedler Gallery settled a lawsuit with collectors Domenico and Eleanore De Sole over the sale of a fake Mark Rothko painting. The agreements — the terms of which have not been disclosed — put an end to the sixth lawsuit related to the Knoedler forgery scandal to have been settled. Four more lawsuits are still pending. Pierre Le Guennec, a retired French electrician who worked for Pablo Picasso, revealed some of the works in a trove of 271 previously undocumented Picassos. The works, all dating from between 1900 and 1932, are said to be worth €40 million (~$45 million). With the end of the standoff at Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, the property will be combed over by a bomb squad, the FBI’s evidence and forensics teams, and, finally, the FBI’s art-crime unit will investigate the site to see if any of the Paiute Indian burial sites or artifacts in the refuge were disturbed or damaged. An appeals court in Paris upheld a previous ruling that the French teacher Frederic Durand-Baissas can sue Facebook in France for censoring his post of Gustave Courbet’s painting  “L’Origine du Monde” (1866) in 2011. The social network had argued that it could only be sued in California, where it is headquartered. A group of Croatian artists calling themselves Kulturnjaci 2016 protest the country’s newly appointed Culture Minister, the historian Zlatko Hasanbegović, who they claim lacks expertise and who, in his decisions since his appointment, “flirts with fascism.” The Chinese performance artist Ou Zhihang did nude pushups at the sites of the Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan massacres in Paris. An exhibition sponsored by the National Riffle Association at the National Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has sparked protests from gun control activists. Argentina and Spain repatriated 567 heritage objects to Ecuador. A painting by the Western Australian artist Marcia Purdie that turned up in a thrift store donation pile in December has sold for 1,800 Australian dollars (~$1,280).

Transgender performance artist Niv Acosta claimed that employees at Spa Castle refused to grant him a key to the women’s locker room. A chateau in Uzès in the south of France that once belonged to the British art critic Douglas Cooper — and which Picasso tried to buy from him, to no avail — is on the market for $9.9 million. It includes a series of five sculpture murals on its veranda. The City of Paris launched a new initiative to create one city-run mural space for street art in each of Paris’s 20 arrondissements. The names of the artists who will create the first 10 murals were picked out of glass bowls at random during a ceremony at Paris’s Hôtel de Ville. New Brunswick’s Department of Tourism, Heritage, and Culture will cut the budget of the New Brunswick Arts Board by $400,000 over the next two years, firing all its employees and taking over its operations.

The Dayton Art Institute is about to embark on a $2.2 million renovation project. Artist Geng Jianyi attributed the discovery of a duplicate of one of his earlier paintings to a “failure of memory.” The artist originally claimed that “Hairdressing: Hairwashing,” which was due to be auctioned last October, was not an authentic work. Art dealer Lv Peng recently released a series of letters from the early ’90s in which Geng apparently agreed to repaint a number of his missing works.

340,340,28-06-19 00:00,2019,6,28,,"Google announces new subsea cable 'Equiano', connecting Africa and Europe","(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Friday announced a new subsea cable dubbed “Equiano” that will connect Africa with Europe, as it boosts its cloud computing infrastructure.  Equiano, fully funded by Google, is the company’s third private international cable.  The search engine giant, which has invested $47 billion in improving its global technology infrastructure over the last three years, said Equiano is the company’s 14th subsea cable investment globally.  “Equiano will be the first subsea cable to incorporate optical switching at the fiber-pair level, rather than the traditional approach of wavelength-level switching,” Google said in a blog post.  Google said a contract to build the cable with Alcatel Submarine Networks was signed in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the first phase of the project, connecting South Africa with Portugal, is expected to be completed in 2021.  The company in April completed the “Curie” project, its first private intercontinental cable, connecting Chile to Los Angeles.  It also announced last year the Dunant transatlantic submarine cable project connecting France and the United States. The 6,600 km cable is scheduled to come into service in 2020.

341,341,30-06-19 00:00,2019,6,30,Marc Jones,"Preserve your ammunition, BIS urges top central banks","LONDON (Reuters) - Bank for International Settlements (BIS) chief Agustin Carstens has urged top central banks to preserve their ammunition for more serious economic downturns rather than deplete it chasing higher growth.  Presenting the annual report of the Swiss-based BIS, dubbed the central bank for the world’s central banks, Carstens told reporters any easing needed to be considered carefully and done sparingly.   “We would stress that it is important to preserve some room for maneuver for more serious downturns,” he said.  That message comes just weeks before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to confirm a U-turn in global monetary policy and cut interest rates for first time since the financial crisis a decade ago.  Japan and China have both signaled their readiness to ease further and the European Central Bank, which only halted bond buying in December, indicated this month that it could cut its rates even deeper into negative territory.  While U.S.-China trade tensions have weighed on economic sentiment this year many developed countries had recovered to potential or above potential growth rates, Carstens said. Inflation was mostly not that far from target ranges either.  That raised the question of how forthcoming central banks should be with any additional accommodation.   “Monetary policy should be considered more as a backstop rather than as a spearhead of a strategy to induce higher sustainable growth,” Carstens said.  He also warned that sustained use rendered policies like negative rates or quantitative easing less effective. “How much more stimulus will you get if rates are reduced by another 25 basis points? That will produce a lower profile of bang for that buck,” Carstens said.   The message to conserve firepower from the BIS is not surprising. Until this year it had been urging top central banks to press on with raising rates or at least move away from crisis-era stimulus programs.  The annual report’s primary call was for a better balance to be struck between monetary policy, structural reforms, government fiscal policy and macroprudential measures that encompass regulation of banks and other financial institutions.  Carstens also said the possible short-term gain of lowering borrowing costs had to be balanced against the “potential risks in terms of asset misallocation and asset mispricing and financial stability risks as we move forward”.  The sharp change in direction from the Fed and others this year has seen global markets rocket since January.  Last year’s big drops in European, Asian and eventually U.S. stocks have been replaced by a near 20 percent leap in the S&P 500 and China’s biggest markets, reviving hopes the decade-long global bull-run may not have ended after all.  Global stocks have reflated by roughly $8 trillion, emerging markets have done well even as China’s economy has revealed cracks, yet yields on ultra-safe government bonds like U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds have plunged dramatically.  Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS Monetary and Economic Department, acknowledged that markets had become dependent on accommodative monetary policy and weaning them off that dependence could cause “withdrawal symptoms”.  Following fierce criticism of the Federal Reserve by U.S. President Donald Trump, he also stressed the importance of central bank independence.   “The autonomy of central banks is an important asset and it is an asset that tends to come under threat when it is most needed,” he told Reuters.  “Of course these are challenging times politically for central banks but it is clearly not helpful to try to interfere with their decisions.”  Another of the annual report’s warnings was of a rapid build up of corporate debt via collateralized loan obligations (CLO) and other forms of credit that do not go through the normal regulated banking channels.  It had turned on “some warning lights” Carstens said, having similarities to the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations (CDO) that amplified the U.S. subprime crisis more than a decade ago. The banking sector is now better capitalized, however, he said.

A political gadfly who has flitted through nine minor parties in a 27-year career, his views have changed little since that day in the capital of Brasilia.  But his jeremiad message – that Brazil is a dysfunctional basket case that needs an iron-fisted ruler to restore order – is resonating with Brazilians dispirited by the nation’s soaring crime, moribund economy and entrenched political corruption.  Violent criminals? Bolsonaro says shoot them all. Political enemies? Them too. Corruption? A military coup will drain the swamp if the judicial system won’t, he says. The economy? Bolsonaro wants to privatize state-run companies to keep politicians away from the till.  The 63-year-old is surging. He leads a crowded field of 13 candidates heading into the first round of elections on Oct. 7 with 35 percent of likely votes, according to the latest survey by polling firm Datafolha. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will go head-to-head on Oct. 28. Pollsters give Bolsonaro a roughly 30-percent chance of winning the race outright this weekend; some say privately his chances might be even better than that.  If there is a second round, Bolsonaro’s opponent is likely to be Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party. Datafolha shows them tied in a potential runoff.  Many Brazilians are sounding alarms about Bolsonaro’s autocratic views and those of his vice-presidential running mate, recently retired Army general Hamilton Mourao, who says Brazil’s Constitution can be torn up and rewritten without input from citizens.  Then there are the federal hate speech charges leveled against Bolsonaro for his racist, homophobic and misogynist rants. His highlight reel includes a spat with a congresswoman whom Bolsonaro said was not attractive enough for him to rape.  Bolsonaro’s campaign did not respond to Reuters’ requests for an interview.  But supporters insist that tens of millions of Brazilians are silently rooting for Bolsonaro, even if some will not admit it to friends or pollsters.  Brazilians from all walks of life applaud his vow to make life miserable for armed gangs that have made them prisoners in their own homes. Many welcome his promise to loosen gun laws so average citizens can protect themselves. Business people like his recent embrace of free-market economics.  Young people are enthralled by his caustic put-downs of rivals on social media. Polls show Bolsonaro is performing well with female voters, despite being labeled a misogynist by many.  Evangelical Christians, who comprise a quarter of the electorate, are particularly enamored of Bolsonaro, a Catholic who has promised to rid schools of sex education, derail gay rights and thwart any attempts to loosen strict abortion laws. Some see his recent survival of a near-fatal knife attack on the campaign trail as a sign that Bolsonaro, whose middle name Messias means “Messiah,” was sent by God to lead them.  Others view him as the only option to prevent the return to power of the Workers Party, or PT, whose founder, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva, is serving a 12-year prison sentence for graft and money laundering.  Teenager Gilson Barbosa Silva, who hails from a tough district of Sao Paulo, says his disgust with the PT is such that he will begrudgingly vote for Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party.  “The options are depressing … (but) he is the only fresh option,” the heavily tattooed 18-year-old said.  Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Sao Paulo business school, said Bolsonaro has deftly capitalized on polarization that has deepened with Lula’s downfall.  “The roots of his support are in the political radicalization that has flourished in Brazil,” Melo said. “Jair Bolsonaro is a symbol of this transition.”  Some pundits call Bolsonaro a “Tropical Trump” because of his large social media following, pugnacious demeanor and multiple wives. Steve Bannon, the U.S. president’s campaign guru, has likewise advised Bolsonaro.  But longtime political observers of Brazil – where full democracy has been the exception to a succession of authoritarian regimes in the last century – say Bolsonaro is a unique creation raised in the long shadow of the country’s most recent dictatorship.   Bolsonaro celebrated his ninth birthday just days before the 1964 coup. The son of an untrained dentist, he opted for the military and in 1977 graduated from the Black Needles Military Academy, Brazil’s equivalent of West Point.  His Army career was undistinguished. Bolsonaro landed in the brig for a couple of weeks in 1986 after a Brazilian news magazine published his complaints about paltry military pay. But his words tapped into widespread discontent among rank-and-file soldiers. He parlayed that support into a seat on Rio de Janeiro’s city council in 1988, then a spot in Congress two years later.  Bolsonaro’s legislative achievements are thin: He has authored just two bills that became law. Still, he has never been tarnished by corruption.  Now, after nearly three decades in politics, Bolsonaro is riding a tsunami of voter frustration that may carry him to the presidency.  Brazil is still hobbling from its worst recession in decades; 13 million are unemployed. Crime has exploded and drug violence has touched every corner of the country. Last year saw nearly 64,000 murders, the most on record. The epic bribery investigation that jailed Lula exposed a pay-to-play political culture of staggering proportions.  Disgust with Brazil’s leaders is palpable. Only 13 percent of Brazilians are “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with democracy overall, according to the most recent annual poll by Latinobarometro, a Chilean think tank.  That toxic environment has Bolsonaro’s backers, much like U.S. voters who sent Donald Trump to the White House, hoping he will be a walking grenade that explodes the system from within.  “If he can lessen graft and get rid of the old, corrupt foxes who rule our political system, then four years from now we will have more candidates who put Brazil’s interests above their own,” said Raphael Enohata, a 26-year-old graduate engineering student at the University of Sao Paulo. “He is just the beginning of the transition we want.”  Drug gangs are also high on Bolsonaro’s hit list.  “We cannot treat criminals like normal human beings who need to be respected,” Bolsonaro said in August. He said law enforcement should pump suspects with “10, 15 or 30” bullets each, then “be given awards” for their efforts.  A few days later at a rally, Bolsonaro grabbed a cameraman’s tripod and mimicked shooting a rifle. “We are going to gun down all these Workers Party supporters!” he shouted as the crowd cheered wildly.  His campaign said it was a joke. But Bolsonaro is serious about what he sees as his destiny.  “God called me to this race,” he said upon accepting his party’s nomination. “My mother gave me the middle name Messiah. But I alone will not be the savior of the Brazil. Who will save it is all of us, together.”   Reporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Marla Dickerson",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-bolsonaro-newsmaker/a-disciple-of-brazils-dictatorship-moves-closer-to-the-presidency-idUSKCN1MF1DP,World News,Reuters
343,343,20-01-17 00:00,2017,1,20,Andrew Osborn,In Trump We Trust: Inauguration prompts celebration in Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin may have spent years reviling America, but Russians  hoping Donald Trump will usher in a new era of detente marked his inauguration on Friday with parties and trinkets from commemorative coins to “matryoshka” nesting dolls in his image.  Washington was turned into a virtual fortress with an estimated 900,000 people — backers and protesters — descending on the capital. In London, anti-Trump activists draped a banner reading “Build Bridges Not Walls” from Tower Bridge. Protests were planned across western Europe on Friday and Saturday.   But according to Gennady Gudkov, a Putin critic and former lawmaker, Russia is in the grip of “Trumpomania”, with state media giving the President-elect blanket air time at the expense of more mundane and sometimes depressing domestic news stories.  That, he said, was in part because the U.S. election, unlike elections in Russia, had been unpredictable. The Kremlin is hoping Trump will ease sanctions imposed over the annexation of Crimea, team up with Russia against Islamic State, and cut back NATO military activity near Russian borders.  Craftsmen in the city of Zlatoust, east of Moscow, have released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with “In Trump We Trust” - an allusion to the phrase on U.S. banknotes “In God We Trust”.  Sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added Trump dolls to their popular line-up of items carved in the likeness of President Vladimir Putin, Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev and Josef Stalin.  And a shop selling Russian military kit located opposite the U.S. embassy in Moscow has unveiled a cheeky promotional campaign offering embassy employees and U.S. citizens a 10 percent discount on its wares to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.  Some of Trump’s opponents believe the Kremlin helped him win the White House by staging a hacking campaign to hoover up embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, his rival. The Kremlin denies that, but few here make any secret of the fact that they are pleased that Trump and not Clinton triumphed.    Relations between Putin and Barack Obama had soured badly.    “Trump’s election has generated enormous enthusiasm in Russia because his warm words about Russia and Putin have given us hope that the USA and the West will stop their attack on Russia,” Sergei Markov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker, said on social media.  “We don’t know for sure if there will be an improvement (in relations) or not. But we Russians are optimists ... so we are hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.”  For Russian nationalists, Trump’s inauguration is an excuse to mix fun with self-promotion.  They are holding an all-night party at what used to be the main Soviet-era post office in Moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a  triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen.  Konstantin Rykov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker and one of the event’s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the “New World Order.”        “Washington will be ours,” he quipped.

344,344,07-06-19 00:00,2019,6,7,Giselda Vagnoni,Moderate leaders try to protect Italy - from their own government,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s prime minister and economy minister have formed an unofficial alliance with the president to prevent the euro zone’s third-largest economy being dragged into financial crisis by its ruling parties, sources say.  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, both technocrat appointees, have held private conversations with President Sergio Mattarella in recent days on ways of shielding Italy from a gathering political and financial storm, according to two Italian officials with knowledge of the matter.  Conte and Tria are acting with Mattarella, who has a role in ensuring political stability, to effectively curb the behavior of their own government — a populist coalition whose party leaders are railing against EU budget rules.  The coalition’s confrontation with the European Commission, which has flagged possible disciplinary action over Rome’s big-spending fiscal policies, has sent a shiver through Italian bonds and rekindled fears of a full-blown financial crisis.  “Mattarella is trying to keep the boat afloat,” said one senior government official.  Though the coalition’s dominant political force is League leader Matteo Salvini, the prime minister is in charge of negotiating with Brussels over budget policy, and both he and Tria could do serious damage to the government if they were to wield the ultimate political weapon.  Both Salvini and his coalition partner Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star party, know that the resignations of two men seen by markets as Italy’s main guarantee of fiscal prudence would be likely to send the value of its debt tumbling, and neither wants to risk this.  Conte has already threatened this week to resign, saying EU rules should be respected. Tria, a former academic, told Reuters that daily quarrels between Salvini and Di Maio were damaging Italy.  “What’s going on is weakening my negotiating power with the EU,” Tria said on the sidelines of a ceremony at the Quirinale presidential palace. “It means that Italy is not a country that can be taken seriously.”  As for Mattarella - the presidency is mostly a figurehead role, but it has the power during political crises to make or break governments. Neither the League nor 5-Star would want to make an enemy of the president.  The League, rooted in rich northern regions, and 5-Star, whose voters mainly live in the poorer south, forged their alliance a year ago, but last month’s European Parliament elections have given Salvini the upper hand.  The League doubled its vote from the 2018 general election and Salvini has been acting as de facto prime minister, vowing not to bow to budget pressure from Brussels. On Thursday, Di Maio agreed to back the League’s tax-cutting plan as a priority.  With a debt of 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion), Italy is viewed by most economists as too big to fail, and financial instability there could endanger the stability of the entire euro zone.   “The main concern of the president is who will draw up the 2020 budget and what’s in Salvini’s mind,” said another official.  The fact that Italian debt continues to rise as a proportion of GDP prompted the European Commission on Wednesday to start a process that could lead to financial sanctions and stricter oversight of fiscal policy.  Investors are already asking for interest rates some 0.7 percentage points higher than a year ago to buying Italian 10-year sovereign bonds.  In October, the gap between Italian 10-year bond yields and those from Germany, the euro zone’s benchmark, spiked to over 3.4 percentage points after the EU rejected the government’s 2019 budget. A compromise defused the crisis - but another showdown between Rome and Brussels would send these premiums soaring again.  The worst-case scenario for Mattarella would be a government collapse later this year that prevented the approval of the 2020 budget by the end of December, as required by law.  One of the top officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said that Brussels had asked Rome to cut its 2019 deficit by around 0.2 percentage points of GDP, or some 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion).  “We need to stop talking against Europe and show convincing numbers over the deficit and debt trends,” this official said.  Late last year, Tria, Conte and Mattarella, backed by Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco, succeeded in persuading Salvini and Di Maio to trim the 2019 deficit target to avoid EU fines. Visco also has a direct line to his predecessor and current head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.  Conte’s office said on Wednesday that Italy’s deficit-to-GDP ratio for 2019 was already set to come in at 2.1%, well below the official 2.4% target.  Salvini’s growing self-confidence has fueled speculation that he will abandon 5-Star and seek a new election, though he has denied this. But he may not be in a mood to make another compromise on his anti-austerity budget plans.  The League’s economics chief, Claudio Borghi, told Reuters this week that it had only agreed to back down in December because it was the junior partner. The EU vote showed it was now the top dog, he said.

After spending time studying the drink in Mexico, Mercer returned as a leading consultant, having fully earned the job title Tequila Goddess. Today she's head mixologist at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a premiere hotel and casino. There she presides over a beverage production test kitchen, tinkering with ingredients and dreaming up menus for one of the largest fresh beverage programs in the world. We caught up with her to find out what and where she likes to drink in Las Vegas. VICE: You're a Las Vegas native?Mariena Mercer: Correct. I'm second generation, so both of my parents were raised here, which is a bit of a rarity. My whole family is still here, and I've lived here my whole life. I'm actually named after a casino, which is really bizarre. There used to be the Marina hotel and casino. The original building is still there. My dad was driving to the hospital and saw the Marina and fell in love with it. What was your career before coming to The Cosmopolitan?I was studying chemistry in school and started working in a steakhouse. I came from humble upbringings, so it opened up a whole other world of hospitality. We had a master sommelier. I was just fascinated and really fell in love with wine and the beverage world.How did you get the name Tequila Goddess?[At the steakhouse] we had beverage instructors from across the street at a neighboring property. They would come over and I'd just ask them a million questions about the beverage world and what they were drinking. They found it very endearing and created this job for me called the Tequila Goddess because they knew I was turning 21. I was like, ""Absolutely not. What does that mean?"" They just said, ""Go home and think about it."" I went home and studied tequila for four hours before I went to sleep and was so fascinated. That was almost 12 years ago. For my 21st birthday I went out to the town of Tequila and got to live intermittently at different distilleries and travel and really immerse myself into every part of the process. I fell in love with the culture. I fell in love with everything about it. I came home and I was going to be one of the leading experts in tequila in the states at that time because no one was doing a deep dive into it like I was. I started getting hired to do a lot of consulting across the country. From there I went into bartending and bartended at several properties on the Strip. I dropped out of college and decided that's what I really wanted to do.Do you apply your chemistry background to your job now?Absolutely. I think my brain always thinks in that kind of method. I love alchemy and the way things mix, whether it's chemical or culinary or cocktails. I'm just fascinated with how things mix, or acidity, or how things become better or change speeds. I was fortunate to carve out my own style. Growing up my idols were Willy Wonka and Bill Nye the Science Guy. I'd like to think I've grown into a combination of the two. What are you working on now?I just launched The Chandelier menu, and it's my favorite I've done so far. It's whimsical and playful. It's something that I call multisensory—there's a lot of experiential cocktails as far as oils and aromas, nitrogen and edible components. Every single cocktail is a story or something very personal to me, or something I can kind of weave the cocktail around. Each one has tons of different arms and legs, but hopefully communicates the story to each guest.Where are some of your favorite places to eat and drink both on and off strip?I love Velveteen Rabbit, off the Strip. The sisters who run it are just incredible. They have a unique sense of style in every sense of that word, as far as the fashion, the design, the cocktails. Everything is such an engaging, incredible experience. It's a local bar to me, a place you can go and chat up other people. It's creative mindsets that tend to have cocktails there, so you can meet really great people in a different field who maybe have commonalities with.Where else?My next pick would be Herbs & Rye. They've got a really talented staff. Their foundation in classic cocktails is so strong, and the food is great. They call it the clubhouse, and it really does feel like one. You go in there and you know three-quarters of the room. It's always a really fun time and it can get a little debaucherous. It's a passion project for Nectaly, the owner, and I have a ton of respect for where he's come from and all of his work to make it come to fruition.What are some drink trends right now?I love sherry. I love modifying it. I love sipping sherry. I love sipping sherry with food. It really is one of my favorite spirits of all time. I think a lot of people correlate it with maybe your grandma drinking dry sherry, but once you deep dive into sherry it's such a beautiful spirit. I love sherry and I don't know if anyone does it better than José Andrés at Jaleo. It's romantic to be able to sip sherry with small bites. Sherry cocktails and sherry as a sipping component is definitely a trend.What makes Vegas unique compared to other drinking cities?Volume, but quality volume. It's been an amazing, refreshing change in the past couple of years. Six years ago when I first had my meeting with Cosmopolitan, there was such a cognitive dissonance between great restaurants where you go and you have every celebrity chef in the world making these really expensive meals with these great and quality ingredients and then you get a margarita that has a sweet and sour mix. I really wanted to elevate the quality of cocktails in Las Vegas, and I think that's really happened. It's really exciting.  Read the entire VICE Guide to Las Vegas here.

349,349,25-12-16 17:00,2016,12,25,Roisin Kiberd,Why 2016 Was the Year of the Algorithmic Timeline,"2016 was the year of ""post fact"" news, but it was also the year of post-new news. 2016 was the year of the algorithmic timeline, in which tech companies dismantled the concept of time entirely. This year saw Facebook, Twitter and Instagram occupy the role of mainstream media publishers, whether or not they chose to admit it. Each platform instituted similar changes: their ""timeline"" would no longer display the most recent story at the top, but would use algorithms to decide on what individual users most wanted to see. Depending on our friendships and actions, the system might deliver old news, biased news, or news which had already been disproven. In many cases what we saw was speculation and rumor; stories which weren't really news at all. A (chronological) timeline of these changes would include: Not long ago social media was lauded for granting access to information, building connections and ""making the world more open and connected."" But now machines pre-empt our impulses, herding us into habits and repetition.  2016 was the year of politicians telling us what we should believe, but it was also the year of machines telling us what we should want.  In the world of Instagram, some things will always be current: organic breakfasts, taut ""bikini bodies"" and tiny adorable dogs among them. But even with a prolific following and a popular niche, creators are at the mercy of Instagram's rules.  I spoke to several well-known Instagram creators, drawing on Motherboard's ties to the Instagram corgi underworld. ""Followers have drastically declined,"" Jeri Yoshizu told me in an email, the anonymous custodian of the wildly popular Three Corgis account, which has 146,000 Instagram followers. ""We used to get 1,000 a week, now it's half that."" Keeping up with changes is a full-time job: ""They've done a good job of getting rid of crazy spammers, but it does come with a price of lower engagement.""  Khoa Phan is ""corgdad"" to Lilo (31,500 followers). He said he has experienced similar issues: ""I think my posts are a bit buried among all of the other photos. People either have to get notified that I've posted a new photo, or they have to go to the profile directly. I used to have a regular time when I would post my photos. Now that Instagram doesn't display photos chronologically, that approach seems pointless."" The only way to insure your posts gain notice is to bombard the feed and hope that some stick, which risks comprising on quality and annoying people.  Varsha Sreekumar looks after Elvis Pawsley, a dog with ""short legs"" and ""big dreams."" She saw the changes as contradictory to Instagram's ""insta"" nature, driving users to like content only if they know they'll want more of the same in future. ""I enjoyed the freedom of engaging with a piece of content without any sort of ripple effect. It really limits the discovery and exploration potential of the app."" Sreekumar added: ""Interestingly enough, the change was made after Instagram opened the doors to brands to run ads."" But even once they pay for visibility, a brand under pressure to remain engaging: ""Playing devil's advocate for a second here: All the money in the world cannot transform shitty content into good content."" What happens when users realize they're trapped in a loop? By then, will automated ""good taste"" be more sophisticated? There is a bizarre hubris to altering time, as if a person—or company—believes they are greater than physics.  The mark of the despot is to rewrite the clock and calendar: in 2002 Turkmenistan renamed the months according to the will of Saparmurat Niyazov, its ""President for Life"" (January was named for the leader himself, April was named after his mother). Last year North Korea reverted to ""Pyongyang Time,"" pushing clocks forward by thirty minutes in defiance of Japan. Finally, there are those who reinvent time as a commercial venture: Swatch decision in 1999 to launch a decimalized, centralized unit of time they called the "".beat."" intended to serve as a universal ""internet time,"" or chronological Esperanto. Today these examples are regarded as laughable. But social media's ""New Time"" is more tenacious, because it is less obviously a break with normality. It disorients the reader, and distracts them with endless, timeless content. Today sites do not even hide their filter bubble effect: Instagram's announcement of it's newly atemporal feed, titled ""See the Moments You Care About First,"" was a masterpiece of presumptive thinking. Apparently we ""care,"" on an emotional level, about the app. Apparently we trust it to select what we see. It makes sense that social media sites would want you to forget linear time, because the more time you spend on these sites, the more you are worth to them (in this way social media is like a casino, where they change your money ""chips"" to keep you from noticing when you lose it). Time is flattened into a slideshow, a sentimental carousel.  This moves us into a different sense of time, an achronological ""lame infinity."" A place where the present is filtered to look old while the old renews itself constantly. Where rumors are powerful than news because they keep coming back until they're disproven.  Speaking to me by email, Carl Miller, Research Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (part of cross-party British think tank Demos), highlighted the power of these algorithms as gatekeepers of—and even replacements for—traditional media: ""The Facebook news algorithm is more powerful than any newspaper editor in the world. It may become more powerful than every newspaper editor in the world."" Capable of spreading lies just as quickly as they spread knowledge, can algorithms really be trusted with forming the worldview of social media users? Miller warned, ""The concern is that they can't resign, and don't play by professional standards; we don't even really know—as outsiders —how they work."" Where does this leave us, creators and consumers alike, gazing headlong into 2017? Perhaps soon we will get used to the algorithmic timeline, and stop expecting our news to be current. Perhaps soon we'll stop looking to consume news at all and happily continue, trapped in Throwback Thursday for the rest of (nonlinear) time.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvbaw/why-2016-was-the-year-of-the-algorithmic-timeline,Tech by VICE,Vice
350,350,22-07-16 03:34,2016,7,22,German Lopez,"Watch Donald Trump reach out to “L, G, B, T… Q” Americans","CLEVELAND — Donald Trump’s Republican convention speech had a genuinely surprising, sincere moment. It came when Trump brought up the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. He said, ""Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted [the] LGBTQ community. No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me."" The crowd cheered and clapped — not exactly a sure thing with a Republican audience when it comes to protecting LGBTQ people’s rights. And Trump, in an unscripted moment, acknowledged the crowd’s surprising reaction: ""And I have to say, as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you."" It’s long been said that Trump doesn’t care much about LGBTQ or other cultural issues. (Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel said as much in his Republican convention speech.) To the extent that Trump opposes same-sex marriage, it’s out of political convenience. This brief moment in the speech provides a sign that may be true. But the rhetoric Trump is using has some ugly roots: It’s essentially a European right-wing strategy to pit LGBTQ people against Muslims. As my colleague Dylan Matthews explained, European right-wingers often use Middle Eastern countries’ horrific records on gay rights to try to foster Islamophobic sentiments among LGBTQ communities — a sentiment they can tap into to garner restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. It’s effectively pro-gay Islamophobia. The crowd’s reaction also does not mean that Republicans have progressed on gay rights or LGBTQ issues more broadly. Despite some LGBTQ advocates’ hopes that the party would drop these types of battles after losing on same-sex marriage, the 2016 platform includes continued opposition to marriage equality, support for North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom law, support for anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy, and a tacit condemnation of same-sex parents. But at the very least, the Republican convention will clap and cheer for ending anti-LGBTQ murder.",https://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12254616/trump-acceptance-speech-lgbtq-rnc,,Vox

352,352,16-06-19 00:00,2019,6,16,"Adam Jourdan, Nicolás Misculin, Eliana Raszewski","Power mostly restored after massive blackout in Argentina, but questions remain","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Power returned to much of Argentina and two neighboring countries following a massive blackout that left tens of millions in the dark on Sunday, but Argentine President Mauricio Macri said the cause of the “unprecedented” outage was still unclear.  Argentina’s grid “collapsed” around 7 a.m. (1100 GMT), leaving the entire country without power, Argentina’s Energy Secretariat said. The outage also cut electricity to much of neighboring Uruguay and swaths of Paraguay, and shut down YPF SA’s La Plata refinery, Argentina’s largest.  Power had returned to nearly 90 percent of Argentina by early on Sunday evening and to virtually all of Uruguay and Paraguay, officials in each country said.  Macri´s energy secretary, Gustavo Lopetegui, told reporters earlier in the day that the blackout started with a failure in the country´s “interconnection system,” known as SADI, but said the root cause of the outage remained unknown and that results of a full investigation would not be available for 10 to 15 days.   “There was a failure in the system, the kind that happens regularly in Argentina and other countries,” said Lopetegui, adding that “a chain of events that took place later ... caused a total disruption.”  “This case is unprecedented and will be deeply investigated,” Macri said on social media.  The blackout comes amid a deepening economic crisis in Argentina that has plunged nearly a third of the country into poverty, pushed interest rates skyward and sent the peso tumbling against the dollar, prompting mass protests throughout the country.     Residents of Buenos Aires, a city of nearly 16 million, awoke on Father´s Day to a nearly entirely dark city. The blackout hobbled public transportation, cut off water supplies and crippled phone and internet communications for much of the day.   Images from social media showed long lines of cars at the few service stations still in operation in Argentina’s largest city and traffic lights dim, creating chaos in places even on a normally quiet Sunday.  “The city is a disaster. There are no traffic lights. Stores aren’t open. It spoiled Father’s Day,” said 75-year-old retiree Liliana Comis.   Speculation abounded on social media about the causes of the blackout, as well as sharp rebukes by critics of Macri, who is running for re-election later this year in a hotly contested race.  “Millions of Argentines, who have had to pay astronomical rates for electricity to benefit those in power, are still waiting for power to return to their homes,” Alberto Fernandez, a Peronist presidential candidate, said in a tweet on Sunday afternoon.  The blackout also renewed questions about the vulnerability of parts of the South American grid, which transcends borders and connects many of the region´s largest economies.  A similarly massive outage in Brazil in 2009, caused by a failure at the country´s sprawling Itaipu hydroelectric plant, cut power to tens of millions and led to calls for Brazil to beef up its energy infrastructure.  A spokesman for Argentine state oil company YPF told Reuters that its La Plata refinery, a critical link in the country’s oil infrastructure, had been temporarily shut down following the outage.   Argentina is also home to the Vaca Muerta shale formation, one of the world’s biggest reserves of shale gas and oil. It was not immediately clear to what extent drilling operations there had been affected.  Brazil, despite its connection to the Argentine grid, appeared to escape any serious impact from the blackout.   A spokesman for Brazil’s power system operator, Operador Nacional do Sistema Eletrico (ONS), told Reuters early on Sunday the outage had not affected that country.

354,354,28-01-17 00:00,2017,1,28,Mica Rosenberg,Factbox: What's in Trump's order halting refugee program,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks.  Here is what Trump’s order on “extreme vetting” - denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory - includes.  The order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for 90 days. While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. There is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations.  The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat.  The order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country, which could include holding more in-person interviews, searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms.   Under the current system, some visa applications require interviews but others do not. The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded.        The order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration.  Immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. In an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are “not unduly affected,” the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.   The order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, although there will be case-by-case exceptions.  The order also implemented a blanket ban of all Syrian refugees until “sufficient changes” have been made to the refugee program, without giving more details.  After the suspension is lifted, the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious-based prosecution, but only if they are minorities in their country.  Trump said in a television interview that the move would protect Christians. It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say.  Once refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016.  In a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there.  COMPLETING THE “BIOMETRIC ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEM”  The system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors’ arrival and departure using information like finger prints. Former President Barack Obama’s administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the country’s largest airports by 2018.  Some experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. According to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would “offer mixed value for enforcement objectives.”  (This version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of “Iraq” in paragraph 3)  Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-refugees-factbox/factbox-whats-in-trumps-order-halting-refugee-program-idUSKBN15C052,Politics,Reuters

356,356,28-06-19 03:30,2019,6,28,Tara Golshan,Democratic debate: Pete Buttigieg challenged on handling of South Bend shooting,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg was put in the hot seat during the second Democratic presidential debate Thursday when, in the aftermath of an officer-involved shooting in South Bend, Indiana, he was asked: Why is the city’s police force so white? “The police force is 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black,” moderator Chuck Todd asked. “Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?” “Because I couldn’t get it done,” Buttigieg said. He continued to say that he was “determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching, feels the same thing. Not of fear, but of safety. I am going to bring about that very thing.” A South Bend police officer shot and killed 54-year-old black resident Eric Logan on June 16, responding to reports that a man was breaking into cars with a knife. The police officer’s body camera was turned off at the time. Since then, Buttigieg has faced protesters at home as black residents openly questioned whether he cares more about winning the votes of black voters nationwide than he does about fixing the injustices in his city’s public offices. The city is investigating the shooting. On Thursday night, it wasn’t just the debate moderators who had questions for Buttigieg’s handling of racial tensions in his hometown. Several of his competitors on the stage took shots at him as well. At one point, California Rep. Eric Swalwell asked Buttigieg repeatedly why he didn’t fire the current police chief after Logan’s death — a comment that visibly angered Buttigieg. Here’s the exchange: HICKENLOOPER: If I can ask one more question: The question they are asking in South Bend and across the country is why has it taken so long? We had a shooting when I became mayor 10 years before Ferguson. We diversified the police force and ... we did deescalation training. I think the real question that America should be asking is why, five years after Ferguson, every city doesn’t have this level of accountability. BUTTIGIEG: I have to respond to that. We have taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP denounced me for too much accountability, and I accept responsibility for that because I’m in charge. SWALWELL: If the camera wasn’t on and that was the policy, you should fire the chief. BUTTIGIEG: So under Indiana law, this will be investigated, and there will be accountability for the officer involved. SWALWELL: But you are the mayor. You should fire the chief — if that’s the policy and someone died. Buttigieg’s handling of outreach to his black constituents has been questioned in South Bend before. In 2012, two months after taking office, Buttigieg fired black Police Chief Darryl Boykins for allegedly taping his white senior officers’ phone calls in an attempt to catch them using racist language, the New York Times reported. Critics argued that Buttigieg, who is white, took the side of white officers who accused Boykins of wrongdoing. He’s replaced Boykins with two white police chiefs. At the time, some in the community called for Buttigieg to be impeached over his handling of the matter, South Bend’s WNDU reported. That said, Buttigieg ran for reelection in 2015 and won with an overwhelming majority — beating the Republican candidate with 80 percent of the vote. Buttigieg’s campaign has been vocal about its attempted outreach with minorities, and its need to better connect with communities of color, with the mayor calling it “one of the most important pieces of homework for our campaign.” The need to do that homework seems to remain; recent polling shows him garnering only 2 percent of black voters’ support. And the recent shooting has only amplified what has been a constant shadow over the mayor’s presidential campaign: his at times strained relationships with communities of color.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18935564/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-shooting-racism-democratic-debate,,Vox

The administration of President Donald Trump announced in September it would scrap the 2012 program launched by former President Barack Obama, and said it was up to Congress to find a legislative solution.  Several plaintiffs, including the University of California, which enrolls many DACA recipients, sued over the administration’s decision, and in January, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issued the injunction. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, made a similar finding, and a judge in Washington, D.C., gave the government extra time to explain its reasoning.   U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the program was unlawful when he announced the end of DACA, a position the appeals court judges asked attorneys for the government to explain on Tuesday.  Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan responded that it was within the government’s discretion to decide the fate of the program.  “It is perfectly lawful to have a zero tolerance enforcement policy, but it is potentially unlawful to not enforce the law on a large swath of people,” Mooppan said.  Lawyers for plaintiffs challenging DACA’s termination argued that while Obama was clearly within his rights to establish the program, its end robbed hundreds of thousands of young immigrants of protections they had come to rely on.  Outside the Pasadena courthouse on Tuesday, some 30 DACA supporters gathered in a rose garden, shouting slogans in Spanish and English.  Ali Torabi, 27, a DACA recipient who came from Iran with his mother and younger brother 23 years ago, said he is hoping for a favorable decision from the courts since Congress seems unable to act.  “Both parties are playing a lot of politics with our lives,” Torabi said. “They’ve let us down so many times.”  The panel of judges, all appointed by Democratic presidents, could issue its decision at any time. The Supreme Court, which in February declined a request to weigh in before the appellate court, said at the time it assumed the appeals court would rule swiftly.

The Democrats on the other hand, received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago, not so good. Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order. Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally. Some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon — and I mean very soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths — the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else. These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17% in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore. In the president's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total of 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That is 16 years ago. Our trade deficit in goods reached — think of this — our trade deficit is $800 hundred billion dollars. Think of that. $800 billion last year alone. We will fix that. The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps. Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing. It will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate, the symbol of American prestige around the globe was brought down in flames. America is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment, something pointed out by Bernie Sanders are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq had seen a big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: Death, destruction and terrorism and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now — poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad — will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America first. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve. The American people will come first once again. First, my plan will begin with safety at home which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It is for their benefit. For their benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever. My message is that things have to change and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that had been ignored, neglected and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten, but they will not be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice. I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws, or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no no consequence — I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country. When the FBI director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes. In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others who have been far less have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders. He never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: Trade deals that strip our country of jobs and the distribution of wealth in the country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their — our communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seeing. This administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and on every single level. When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have really come in every way, have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. And we are going to defeat them bad. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over. At the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many other locations. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good. And we're going to stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And I have to say as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best, gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation- building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, in Egypt, and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel. Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete. Because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction. Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country. My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase — think of this, this is not believable, but this is what is happening — a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of president Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be. Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people. On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and none too protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Is so sad to even be talking about this. We can solve it so quickly. Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, immigration system. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It will not be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve. Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very closely to the words I am about to say: On on January 20 of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from the tremendous cycle of poverty they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat — of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest businesspeople of the world, I'm going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again. I am going to bring our jobs back our jobs to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore. My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the world trade organization. Another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership which will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it is not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and Independence. We will never ever sign bad trade deals. America first again. American first. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about, they are the greatest currently manipulators ever. Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America and will walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal. Our country is going to start building and making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me. It will happen and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end and it very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business. That will never happen with Donald J trump as president. Our steelworkers and are miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of our tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. That is what she is doing and that is what she has done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports, which is a total disaster. Thank you. We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problems. We will completely rebuild our depleted military. And the countries that we protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released 10 point plan has received tremendous better support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in a line and dying. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal, one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every department head and government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association. And will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community because, I will tell you what, the support they have given me — and I'm not sure I totally deserve it — has been so amazing. And has been such a big reason I'm here tonight. They have much to contribute to our policies. Yet our laws prevent you from speaking your mind from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. I will work hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things and so much more. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves a in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job? My dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people. Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. She could pick them out from anywhere. To my sisters, Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me. I have loved my life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. It is time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: All of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people, that would not stand, I mean they said Trump does not have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance, the same people. We love defeating those people, don't we? Love it. No longer can we rely on those same people. In the media and politics who, will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to believe in America. History is watching us now. It's we don't have much time. We don't have much time. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I am asking for your support tonight so that I can be year champion in the White House. And I will be a champion.Your champion. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: ""I'm with her."" I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ""I'm with you the American people."" I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you. To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! God bless you and goodnight! I love you!",https://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12253426/donald-trump-acceptance-speech-transcript-republican-nomination-transcript,,Vox

366,366,29-10-17 00:00,2017,10,29,Frank Pingue,"LA breaks Houston's home spell, evens World Series","HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Los Angeles Dodgers, playing with their backs against the wall for the first time all year, sprang back to life with a five-run ninth inning on Saturday to beat the Houston Astros 6-2 and level the World Series at two games apiece.  With Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw set to take the mound for Sunday’s pivotal Game Five in Houston, the best team in baseball all season are suddenly back on track in their quest for a first World Series title since 1988.  “It’s now a three-game series, and we’ve got our ace going tomorrow. So I know that in our clubhouse we feel good,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  The Dodgers, who breezed through regular season and into World Series, were staring at a potential 3-1 series deficit until Cody Bellinger’s bat came alive when he doubled and scored the tying run in the seventh inning.  Bellinger, who had been hitless in his previous 13 plate appearances, then put the Dodgers ahead in the ninth with a run-scoring double as part of a five-run inning that was capped by Joc Pederson’s three-run blast.  “We’ve been doing it all year. We’re a super resilient team,” said Bellinger, whose Dodgers are now guaranteed to host a Game Six on Tuesday. “Taking one here to make sure we go back to LA is huge.”  The game had been a tight affair as both teams got stellar outings from their starting pitchers.  Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood was working on a no-hitter when George Springer opened the scoring with a two-out homer in the sixth that ended the pitcher’s night. The Dodgers responded an inning later when a Logan Forsythe scored single Bellinger.  “I was glad to keep us in it long enough to where our bats came alive. That felt like us there those last few innings,”  said Wood. “It’s a big win for us. We’ve got our guy going tomorrow, so we’re excited to be able to take it back to LA, too.”  Houston’s Charlie Morgan was nearly as impressive as he allowed just three hits in 6-1/3 innings.  The Astros sent closer Ken Giles out for the ninth and he  promptly allowed a single to Corey Seager, a walk to Justin Turner before Bellinger put the Dodgers ahead.  “He hadn’t faced those guys a ton, but they didn’t have good swings against him in LA,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Giles. “One ground-ball base hit to start the inning and things sort of sped up on him a little bit, the walk after that.”  With the Astros down to their final strike, Alex Bregman homered to left but it proved too little too late as Houston’s unbeaten home stretch in the postseason ended at seven games.  Game Five of the best-of-seven World Series is scheduled for Sunday in Houston where the Astros will send Dallas Keuchel to the mound against Kershaw in a battle of left-handed former Cy Young Award winners.

367,367,08-11-18 17:30,2018,11,8,Dylan Matthews,Midterm 2018 Senate results: Democrats are unlikely to retake until 2022 or 2024,"Despite a great night in House elections, Democrats have lost ground in the Senate. Depending on what happens in Florida and Arizona, the party will hold anywhere between 46 and 48 seats in the US Senate. Any of those options represents a net loss for the party, which currently holds 49 seats. That’s bad enough for the party in the near term. But it’s worse in the medium run. This year’s losses mean that Democrats will have a very hard time retaking the Senate in 2020. Before the election, FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich noted that with a 52-48 Senate in Republicans’ favor, Democrats in 2020 would need to hold on to Doug Jones’s seat in Alabama, defeat both Susan Collins in Maine and Cory Gardner in Colorado, and pick up a seat in a red state by ousting at least one of Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Jon Kyl in Arizona (who’s not seeking reelection), or David Perdue in Georgia. (They’d need one less if they also take the presidency.) In the worst-case scenario for Democrats, a 54-46 Senate, they’d need to flip five seats and hold on to Alabama. A likely path might involve flipping Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, and Arizona, in a year that’s not likely to be as Democratic-leaning as 2018. And that’s assuming that Jones holds on in Alabama, as do New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, Virginia’s Mark Warner, and Michigan’s Gary Peters. Some of them are likely to hold on, but Jones at least is likely to fall, and Shaheen and Warner came close in 2014. Putting it all together, a Democratic flip sounds unlikely. The upshot is clear: Democrats will probably remain in the minority in the Senate until at least 2022. That failure will have grave consequences not just for the prospects of future progressive legislation, like Medicare-for-all or action on climate change, but also for the next few decades of the federal judiciary. The primary consequence of Democrats’ failure in the Senate, in the near term, is that they’ll be unable to stop President Trump’s judicial appointments. They’ll have fewer votes to resist with than they did for Brett Kavanaugh. That could help Republicans solidify or expand their dominance on the Supreme Court. Clarence Thomas is relatively young (only 70), and he could time his retirement for next year or 2020 to ensure a Republican president and Senate determine his successor. And while Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85 and a two-time cancer survivor, and Stephen Breyer, 80, are unlikely to retire under Trump, Democrats should pray for their continued good health, especially given news that Ginsburg fell, broke three ribs, and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning. Then there are the lower courts. There are currently 122 vacancies on district courts and circuit courts of appeals for Trump to fill, out of 856 total. As analysis from the team at Ballotpedia shows, the aging of the federal judiciary means that by the end of 2020, slightly more than half of district and appeals court judgeships will be a) vacant, b) filled by Trump, or c) held by a judge old enough to take senior status and semi-retire, opening up the seat for another judge. Not all of those judges will take senior status, of course. But some will. And regardless of how many do, the core point remains that Trump will have considerable power to use his Republican Senate majority, and the 50-vote threshold that Democrats established for lower-court judgeships in 2013, to move the lower courts solidly to the right over the next two years. That’s the situation for 2019 and 2020. With the Senate mostly out of contention in 2020, the picture only gets worse for Democrats. If a Democrat defeats Trump for reelection in 2020 but Democrats also fail to retake the Senate — an outcome that’s especially likely if Democrats fall down to 46 seats this year after Arizona and Florida are counted — that Democratic president would not be able to enact much of any legislation of consequence in her first two years in office. Given her likely losses in the 2022 midterms, it’s unlikely she’d be able to pass major bills for her whole first term. Trump broke the trend due to a highly favorable map, but generally, it’s rare for the president’s party to gain seats in the Senate during a midterm. The last time it happened was 2002, in the wake of 9/11, and the last time before that was 1970. So don’t expect President Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to pass a Medicare-for-all bill, or a job guarantee, or even DC statehood, automatic voter registration, or repairs to the Voting Rights Act. Without control of the Senate in 2021, all those initiatives would be dead in the water. Trump’s hypothetical Democratic successor in 2021 could also be prevented from appointing and confirming any new members of the US Supreme Court. Before the 2016 election, Sens. Ted Cruz, Richard Burr, and John McCain promised that should Hillary Clinton win, they’d favor blocking any and all nominees she put forward for Antonin Scalia’s vacant Supreme Court seat. Unless political polarization and constitutional hardball somehow abates, rather than worsens, by 2021, the Republican caucus is quite likely to adopt a similar strategy then. And if Trump is reelected in 2020, Democratic failure in the Senate would carry graver costs for Democrats. Ginsburg will turn 88 the first year of Trump’s second term, and 92 in 2025, if she decided to wait out Trump. Breyer, who has been in better health but as a man has a lower life expectancy, will be 86 and 90, respectively. It’s also entirely possible that a Trump reelection in 2020 would coincide with a Republican retaking of the House of Representatives. That, combined with a Republican hold on the Senate and Trump’s reelection, would enable new rounds of tax cuts, Medicaid cuts, attempts at Obamacare repeal, and more. Democrats used to rely heavily on seats in red states — not just swing states like Ohio or Iowa, but deep-red states like the Dakotas and Arkansas — for their Senate majority. They don’t anymore, and the Senate map looks increasingly identical to the presidential map. 2016 was the first year in the history of direct Senate elections that every state’s Senate election outcome matched its presidential outcome. That can mean only bad things for Democrats’ viability in the Senate in the medium to long run. Democrats’ losses in 2018 were concentrated overwhelmingly in deep-red states. Republicans flipped Missouri, Indiana, and North Dakota, none of which are normally competitive for Democrats in national elections (flukes like Obama’s 2008 win in Indiana aside), but where Democrats could compete because of popular incumbents from a less polarized age. Similar things happened in 2010 and 2014 in states like Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana, and Alaska, and the 2010 losses weren’t reversed in 2016; indeed, in most cases, like Arkansas and North Dakota, Democrats didn’t even really try to reverse the losses in 2016. Here’s one way to think about what happened on Tuesday: In January 2005, Democrats had even fewer seats than they’re likely to have in 2019, with only 45. But they had 11 members from states that Mitt Romney would later win. Assuming Democratic losses in Florida and Arizona, Democrats will have only three members from Romney states: Jon Tester in Montana, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, and Doug Jones in Alabama. And Jones is likely to lose in 2020. I’m using Romney states here because he and Obama split up the states pretty evenly (26 for Obama, 24 for Romney), but you can do a similar analysis using Bush/Kerry states, Obama/McCain states, or even Clinton/Trump states, though Senate Democrats’ continued strength in the Midwest changes the latter analysis a bit. The point is, Democrats look increasingly uncompetitive for the Senate in states that aren’t at least purple-ish. That doesn’t necessarily have to doom them for Senate control in the long term. There are enough Republican senators from states that Obama won in 2012 — Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, Chuck Grassley, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Ron Johnson, Rob Portman — such that replacing all of them would enable Democrats to retake the body. But the fact that the Senate map is increasingly resembling the presidential map is bad news for Democrats long-term. The Senate has a profound small-state bias, and small states (and rural states) are likelier to be Republican-leaning than large states; that was even more true before Trump flipped some large Midwestern states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Democrats can win a minority of states and win the presidential popular vote, or even the Electoral College, but they can’t win a minority of states and keep the Senate. Moreover, Democrats would be forced to spend on more expensive races in large states rather than relatively cheap races in places like the Dakotas, where they used to be able to win. It’s not obvious, to me, how Democrats get out of that bind.",https://www.vox.com/2018/11/8/18072464/senate-midterm-election-results-democrats-disadvantage,,Vox
369,369,28-07-16 02:06,2016,7,28,Katie Hicks,Read Tim Kaine's DNC speech transcript,"The following is the official transcript for Tim Kaine's 2016 DNC speech: Thank you. Welcome everyone. I want to thank my beautiful wife Anne and my three wonderful children, Nat, Woody, and Annella. Nat deployed with his Marine battalion two days ago to protect and defend the very NATO allies that Donald Trump now says he would abandon. My parents and in-laws are here, our siblings and their spouses, our nieces and nephews, hundreds of friends from Virginia and beyond, including my great friend, Representative Bobby Scott. We love you all. Today, for my wife Anne and every strong woman in this country: for Nat, Woody, and Annella, and every young person starting out in life to make their own dreams real; for every man and woman serving in our military, at home and abroad; for every family working hard to get ahead and stay ahead; for my parents and in-laws and every senior citizen who hopes for a dignified retirement with health care and research to end diseases like Alzheimer's; for every person who wants America to be a beloved community, where people aren't demeaned because of who they are, but rather respected for their contributions to this nation; for all of us who know the brightest future for our country is the one we build together; and for my friend Hillary Clinton, I humbly accept my party's nomination to be Vice President of the United States. I never expected to be here. But let me tell you how it happened. I was born in Minnesota and grew up in Kansas City. My folks weren't much into politics. My dad ran a union ironworking shop. My mom was his best salesman. My brothers and I pitched in to help during summers and on weekends. That's how small family businesses work. My parents, Al and Kathy, taught me about hard work, and about kindness, and most importantly, about faith. I went to a Jesuit boys school — Rockhurst High School. The motto of our school was ""men for others."" That's where my faith became vital, a North Star for orienting my life. And I knew that I wanted to fight for social justice. That's why I took a year off of law school to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. I taught kids welding and carpentry. Aprendi los valores del pueblo — fe, familia, y trabajo. Faith, family, and work. Los mismos valores de la comunidad Latino estan aqui en nuestro país. Somos Americanos todos. And here's what really struck me. I got a first-hand look at a system — a dictatorship — where a few people at the top had power and everyone else got left out. It convinced me that we've got to advance opportunity for everyone. Not matter where they come from, how much money they have, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love. Back in 1970, in Virginia, the Republican Governor Linwood Holton believed exactly the same thing. He integrated public schools so black and white kids would finally learn together, and the family enrolled their own kids, including his own daughter, Anne, in those integrated inner-city schools. When Anne went off to college, she brought with her the lessons borne of that experience. And one day, in a study group, she met this goofy guy who had been off teaching kids in Honduras. Anne and I have now been married for almost 32 years and I am the luckiest husband in the world. Anne's parents, Lin and Jinks, are here today, 90-plus and going strong. Lin's still a Republican. But he's voting for Democrats these days. Because any party that would nominate Donald Trump for president has moved too far away from the party of Lincoln. And if you are looking for that party of Lincoln, we've got a home for you right here in the Democratic party. Lin's example helped inspire me to work as a civil rights lawyer. Over 17 years, I took on banks and landlords, real estate firms, and local governments, anyone who treated people unfairly — like the insurance company that was discriminating against minority neighborhoods all across America in issuing homeowners' insurance. These are the battles I've been fighting my whole life. And that's the story of how I decided to run for office. My city of Richmond was divided and discouraged. An epidemic of gun violence overwhelmed our low income neighborhoods. People were pointing fingers and casting blame instead of finding answers. I couldn't stand it. So I ran for city council. I won that first race, more than 20 years ago, by 94 votes. And I've said ever since — if I'm good at anything, it's because I started at the local level, listening to people, learning about their lives and trying to get results. Later, I became Mayor of Richmond, Lieutenant Governor, and then the 70th Governor of Virginia. I was a hard times governor — steering my state thorugh the deepest recession since the 1930s. But tough times don't last — tough people do. And Virginians are tough. Smart too. We achieved national recognition for our work — best managed state, best state for business, best state for a child to be raised, low unemployment, high family income. We shed tears in the days after a horrible mass shooting at Virginia Tech, but we rolled up our sleeves and fixed a loophole in our background check system to make us safter. And we invested in our people expanding pre-K and higher education, because education was the key to all we wanted to be. Now I have the honor of serving in the Senate. I work on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to keep us safe at home and strong in the world. I work on the Budget Committee with Bernie Sanders, a great leader, fighting for investments in education, health care, research, and transportation. And I serve on the Aging Committee, making sure that seniors have secure retirement and don't get targeted by rip-off artists who will scam them out of their savings or overcharge them for prescription drugs. And here's a funny thing: I spend time with a lot of Republican senators who, once they've made sure nobody's listening, will tell you how fantastic a senator Hillary Clinton was. My journey has convinced me that God has created a rich tapestry in this country — an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everyone in love and battle back against the dark forces of division. We're all neighbors and we must love our neighbors as ourselves. Hillary Clinton and I are compañeros del alma. We share this belief: Do all the good you can. Serve one another. That's what I'm about. That's what you're about. That's what Bernie Sanders is about. That's what Joe Biden is about. That's what Barack and Michelle Obama are about. And that's what Hillary Clinton is about. Now, last week in Cleveland, we heard a lot about trust. So let's talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. First, she's consistent. She has battled to put kids and families first since she was a teenager — in good times and bad, in victory and defeat, in and out of office, through hell or high water. Fighting for underprivileged kids at the Children's Defense Fund. Fighting to get health insurance for 8 million kids when she was First Lady. Fighting for the well-being of women and girls around the world. Here's a little tip for you: When you want to know about the character of someone in public life, look to see if they have a passion, one that began before they were in office, and that they have consistently held on to throughout their career. Hillary's passion is kids and families. Donald Trump has a passion too. It's himself. And it's not just words with Hillary, it's accomplishments. She delivers. As Senator, after 9/11, she battled Congressional Republicans to care for the first responders who saved victims of that terrorist attack. As Secretary of State, she implemented tough sanctions against Iran to pave the way for a diplomatic breatkthrough that curtailed a dangerous nuclear weapons program. She stood up against thugs and dictators and was a key part of the Obama national security team that decided to go to the end of the earth to wipe out Osama bin Laden. Hey, remember Karla, the little girl we heard from on Monday who feared her parents would be deported? She trusts Hillary to keep them together. And remember the Mothers of the Movement we heard from last night? They trust Hillary to keep other mothers' sons and daughters safe. And as he's serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son's life. You know who I don't trust? Donald Trump. The guy promises a lot. But you might have noticed, he has a habit of saying the same two words right after he makes the biggest promises. You guys know the words I mean? ""Believe me."" ""It's gonna be great — believe me! We're gonna build a wall and make Mexico pay for it — believe me! We're gonna destroy ISIS so fast — believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns — believe me!"" By the way, does anyone here believe that Donald Trump's been paying his fair share of taxes? Do you believe he ought to release those tax returns like every other presidential candidate in modern history? Of course he should. Donald, what are you hiding? And yet he still says, ""Believe me."" ""Believe me?"" Here's the thing. Most people, when they run for president, they don't just say ""believe me."" They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. For example, you can go to HillaryClinton.com right now and find out exactly how she'll make the biggest investment in new jobs in generations, and how she'll defend and build on Wall Street reform. you can see how she'll reform our immigration system and create a path to citizenship, and how she'll make it possible to graduate from college debt-free. You can see how she'll guarantee equal pay for women and make paid family leave a reality. With just one click, we can see how she'll do it, how she'll pay for it, and how we'll benefit. Not Donald Trump. He never tells you how he's going to do any of the things he says he's going to do. He just says, ""believe me."" So here's the question. Do you really believe me? Donald Trump's whole career says you better not. Small contractors — companies just like my dad's — believed him when he said that he'd pay them to build a casino in Atlantic City. They did the work, hung the drywall, poured the concrete. But a year after opening, Trump filed for bankruptcy. He walked away with millions. They got pennies on the dollar. Some of them went out of business. All because they believed Donald Trump. Retirees and families in Florida believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them condos. They paid their deposits, but the condos were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump. Charity after charity believed Donald Trump when he said he would contribute to them. And thousands of Trump University students believed Donald Trump when he said he would help them succeed. They got stiffed. He says, ""believe me."" Well, his creditors, his contractors, his laid-off employees, his ripped-off students did just that. Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. Our nation is too great to put it in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting, one man wrecking crew. Don't take it from me. Take it from former First Lady Barbara Bush. She said she didn't know how any woman could vote for him after his offensive comments. Or John McCain's former economic advisor, who estimates Trump's promises would cost America 3.5 million jobs. Or the independent analysts that found Trump's tax plan, a gift to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt. Or John Kasich, the Republican governor who had the honor of hosting the Republican Convention in Cleveland but wouldn't even attend it because he thinks Trump is such a moral disaster. Or take it from the guy who co-wrote Trump's autobiography. For Trump, he said, ""lying is second nature to him."" So, do you believe him? Does anybody here believe him? The next president will face many challenges. We better elect the candidate who's proven she can be trusted with the job. The candidate who's proven she's ready for the job. And by the way, I used the word ""ready"" for a specific reason. When I lived in Honduras, I learned that the best compliment you could give someone was to say they were ""listo"" (ready), not ""inteligente"" (smart), not ""amable"" (friendly), not ""rico"" (rich). But ""listo."" Because what ""listo"" means in Spanish is prepared, battle-tested, rock-solid, up for anything, never backing down. And Hillary Clinton is ""lista."" She's ready because of her faith. She's ready because of her heart. She's ready because of her experience. She's ready because she knows in America we are stronger together. My fellow Democrats, this week we begin the next chapter in our proud story. Thomas declared all men equal and Abigail remembered the women. Woodrow brokered peace and Eleanor broke down barriers. Jack told us what to ask, and Lyndon answered the call. Martin had a dream, Cesar y Dolores said ""si se puede,"" and Harvey gave his life. Bill bridged a century and Barack gave us hope. And now Hillary is ready. Ready to fight, ready to win, ready to lead. Thank you, Philadelphia. God bless you all.",https://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12302896/tim-kaine-dnc-speech-transcript-2016-democratic-convention,,Vox
370,370,17-10-18 00:00,2018,10,17,Sinéad Carew,Wall St. falls as investors eye a united hawkish Fed,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street’s major indexes edged lower after a choppy session on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve showed broad agreement on the need to raise borrowing costs further, cementing investor concerns that had helped cause a major sell-off the week before.  The S&P 500 .SPX zigzagged furiously between positive and negative territory after the 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) release of the Fed's September meeting minutes.   In defiance of sharp criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, policymakers showed agreement on the September hike and general anticipation that further gradual increases would be consistent with the economic expansion, labor market strength, and firm inflation that most forecast.  “In the past several years there’s been a strong dovish component. Now even the doves are starting to roll over,” said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, in Waltham, Mass. “The sense of the meeting was more hawkish than investors might have thought.”  (Graphic: Doves and Hawks - tmsnrt.rs/2dcNoCo)  The S&P has only partially recovered ground lost last week, when it marked its biggest decline since March as investors worried about rate hikes.  The prospect of a more hawkish Fed was exacerbating equity investor fears of uncertainties, ranging from the U.S.-China trade war and weakness in the housing market to the outlook for earnings, said McMillan.  “The market doesn’t really know what to think at this point. That’s why we’re seeing these swings,” he said. “With interest rates higher there’s a lot less cushion to smooth away those uncertainties.”   The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 91.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,706.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,809.21 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,642.70.  Even before the minutes, trading was already choppy, and the S&P 500 struggled to build on the previous day’s rally after disappointing housing data dragged down stocks such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and homebuilders.  Of the S&P’s 11 major sectors, only four ended the day with gains. Financials .SPSY was the biggest gainer, closing 0.9 percent higher. Materials was the biggest loser .SPLRCM, with an 0.8 percent drop.  Home Depot shares fell 4.3 percent while the PHLX Housing index .HGX lost 1.87 percent.   Among the brighter spots was Netflix (NFLX.O), which rose 5.3 percent, after reporting blowout subscriber addition numbers.  United Airlines Inc (UAL.O) shares climbed 5.95 percent after a solid third-quarter profit and again raising its 2018 outlook. That also lifted other airline stocks.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 76 new lows.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.08 billion shares, compared to the 7.9 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

After years of isolation, the once hermitic despot has now travelled abroad three times in three months.   Following last month’s high-profile summit in South Korea, Kim traveled to China Monday for his second meeting with President Xi Jinping, having first met the Chinese leader at a top secret sit-down in Beijing in March.  This time Kim traveled to the north-eastern port city of Dalian for two days of talks with Xi, including a discussion about North Korean denuclearization.  “As long as relevant parties eliminate the hostile policy and security threats against North Korea, North Korea does not need to have nuclear weapons, and denuclearization is achievable,” Kim told Xi, the Chinese Xinhua news agency reported.  Kim added that he wanted to “build mutual trust” with the U.S., adding it would take “phased and synchronous measures in a responsible manner” to achieve denuclearization.

The agency said Xi hosted a welcome banquet for Kim, and the two leaders strolled along the coastline at a government guest house before lunching together Tuesday.  China is seen as North Korea’s closest political and economic ally, though the relationship has strained in recent months with Beijing succumbing to U.N. pressure to impose sanctions on Pyongyang over continued nuclear testing.  Kim is likely to have informed Xi about any developments arising from his historic meeting with South Korea President Moon Jae In.  In a tweet Tuesday morning, Donald Trump said he would be speaking to Xi about North Korea “where relationships and trust are building.”   Kim’s next international summit will be with the U.S. president.   Reports emerged from South Korea in recent days that Trump will meet with Kim in Singapore in the middle of June, soon after the G7 meeting in Canada.  An exact date for the summit could be announced on May 22 when Moon visits Trump at the White House.

372,372,18-06-19 00:00,2019,6,18,,Dutch Intertrust buys U.S.-based Viteos for $330 million,"(Reuters) - Intertrust has acquired U.S.-based Viteos for $330 million, the Dutch business administration company said on Tuesday, in a deal that will help strengthen its foothold in the United States and increase exposure to funds.  “This is a significant leap forward for Intertrust which will accelerate our strategy in every way,” Stephanie Miller, Intertrust’s chief executive said in a statement.  The purchase from PPC Enterprises LLC, FiveW Capital LLC and Viteos management was funded through debt and cash on balance sheet with $11 million re-invested by Viteos’ management and key employees in Intertrust shares.  Interserve shares rose around 5% in early trading.   The deal completed on June 17 is expected to deliver mid-single-digit EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership and double-digit EPS accretion by 2021, including phased synergies.   The company said that the synergies will mainly come from offshoring selected support functions for client-facing teams, back office and IT support.   Intertrust focuses on compliance, business ethics and transparency, helping clients to deal with legal, administrative and regulatory duties in international business.  It expects to deliver approximately 90% of the deal synergies by 2021 with about 20% coming through by next year. The one-off costs over the period to deliver the synergies are estimated at about $30 million.  Following the acquisition, Intertrust raised its medium-term guidance to reflect enhanced revenue growth and cost synergies, and now targets underlying revenue growth of 4-6% year-on-year and adjusted profit margin (EBITA) of at least 40% for 2021.

373,373,21-03-16 16:00,2016,3,21,Tara Golshan,Why rabbis are planning to boycott Donald Trump’s AIPAC speech,"According to Donald Trump, there is ""no one more pro-Israel"" than himself — a phrase he will likely repeat in his speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Monday evening. But Trump's past statements on Israel have prompted rabbis and other AIPAC conference attendees to organize a walkout of the Republican frontrunner's AIPAC speech. ""We must let him speak but we are not obliged to listen,"" an AIPAC attendee said on the protest's organizing Facebook page, which has nearly 1,800 members. ""Our goal is not to disrupt the proceedings or to offend any of our fellow conference attendees. Our hope is to shine a moral light on the darkness that has enveloped Mr. Trump’s campaign,"" reads the description of the Facebook event, ""Come Together Against Hate."" In an interview with Breitbart, Rabbi David Paskin, an organizer of the protest, said the walkout is a reaction to Trump calling Mexican immigrants rapists, most Muslims terrorists, and American Jews money-hungry negotiators. ""This is about denouncing hatred in all forms,"" Paskin told Breitbart. ""Everyone here at AIPAC denounces hatred. ... We are going to continue to come together against hate. We are going to argue that what Mr. Trump calls PC, is not a bad thing, it is what we Jews call … being a good person."" Trump has been walking on shaky ground with pro-Israel Americans this presidential election cycle. While pledging general support toward Israel – a mainstay of Republican foreign policy – he has waffled on some of the specifics. He said he would not move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and would remain ""neutral"" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – two no-nos for the crowd at America's most prolific pro-Israel group (not to mention initially failing to disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke). Trump's attempts to relate to the Jewish community have not always succeeded: He told the crowd at the Jewish Republican Coalition that they should relate to him on the basis of being good negotiators and because his daughter Ivanka Trump is married to a Jew.

374,374,21-03-17 21:42,2017,3,21,Joseph Flynn,Dwight Howard Used to Eat So Much Goddamned Candy,"Atlanta Hawks center Dwight Howard is a physical marvel. He has been that way ever since entering the league straight out of high school—a superhero-scale monster of speed, size, and power. It's a combination rarely seen, particularly in an 18-year-old. So how did Dwight get that marvelous physique? Was it merely genetics, or did he work to hone his body into the instrument it became? Eh, not so much. Stories of Howard's early-career candy habit are well known, or so we thought. Thanks to a recent ESPN piece, we can finally understand just how much sugar he was consuming on a daily basis. Not to give anything away, but: a lot. Let's go back to 2013, when Howard was struggling with the Lakers. The 27-year-old big man was laboring on the court. At first all of his problems seemed to stem from his bad back. But the deeper the Lakers' medical staff, including nutritionist Dr. Cate Shanahan, delved into his health problems, the more shocking the results. Howard's legs tingled, he complained, but she noticed he was having trouble catching passes too, as if his hands were wrapped in oven mitts. Well, he quietly admitted, his fingers also tingled. Shanahan, with two decades of experience in the field, knew Howard possessed a legendary sweet tooth, and she suspected his consumption of sugar was causing a nerve dysfunction called dysesthesia, which she'd seen in patients with prediabetes. It's difficult to reconcile a professional athlete coming down with a sugar-induced nerve dysfunction...at least until you read just how much sugar was coursing through Howard's veins. To alter Howard's diet, though, Shanahan first had to understand it. After calls with his bodyguard, chef and a personal assistant, she uncovered a startling fact: Howard had been scarfing down about two dozen chocolate bars' worth of sugar every single day for years, possibly as long as a decade. 'You name it, he ate it,' she says. Skittles, Starbursts, Rolos, Snickers, Mars bars, Twizzlers, Almond Joys, Kit Kats and oh, how he loved Reese's Pieces. He'd eat them before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner, and like any junkie, he had stashes all over—in his kitchen, his bedroom, his car, a fix always within reach. That's right: 24 chocolate bars' worth of sugar. Every. Freakin'. Day. Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. The medical staff convinced Howard to switch to mostly peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and eventually the tingling sensation in his fingers and legs stopped. Ah, PB&J: Is there anything you can't do? [ESPN]",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgn7db/dwight-howard-used-to-eat-so-much-goddamned-candy,Sports,Vice

376,376,19-02-16 20:40,2016,2,19,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,"Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird is a perfectly built novel, despite its flaws","To Kill a Mockingbird is a perfectly built novel. That doesn't mean the book is perfect. It has flaws — even glaring ones. But Harper Lee made a genius choice in telling the story from the point of view of a child, whose voice she then perfectly embodied. In nearly every review of the book — positive or negative — you'll find mention of how accurately she captures the way a kid sees the world. Except that's not really true, either. Mockingbird is actually told from the point of view of the woman Scout Finch grows up to become, remembering when she was a child. It perfectly feeds into something teenagers are feeling for the very first time: nostalgia This gives Lee an even greater level of remove from the events depicted in the novel, meaning that essentially any flaw you find can be waved away as Scout's imperfect memory of things that happened to her when she was young. From that point of view, then, is it any wonder the book is often assigned to teenagers to read in high school? Certainly, it's a good way to get America's more privileged youth to grapple with the nation's long history of racial injustice. But it also perfectly feeds into something teenagers are feeling for the very first time: nostalgia. Until you are a teenager, you don't really have an opportunity to think back on ""the good old days."" Yes, when you first went to school, you might have been upset that you had to go, and longed for the days when you didn't. But that's not really nostalgia; it's protest of a major shift in your status quo. Nostalgia is marked by a kind of self-aware wisdom, an ability to say, ""This is who I am; this is who I was,"" that kids don't really possess but teenagers are just starting to grasp. Plus, when you're a teenager, you're usually getting the first tastes of real responsibility, which is both exhilarating and melancholy. People trust you to be more independent, but if you screw up, it's on you much more than it would have been when you were 6 or 7, and that can make you feel overwhelmed, longing for a return to a less complicated time. Lee doesn't tell us everything about any character, instead offering up a few telltale mementos of who they might be To Kill a Mockingbird perfectly captures this wistful feeling. The early portions of the book — before Atticus Finch takes on the case of the wrongly accused Tom Robinson — have a misty, elegiac quality. They feel like memories the older Scout is documenting so she doesn't lose them. The novel's greatest asset is Lee's selective use of telling details. She doesn't tell us everything about any character, simply offering up a few telltale little mementos of who they might be. Take, for instance, the focus she places on Atticus's glasses at moments of extreme emotional impact. The care he takes with them extends to the care he takes with his children and his clients, and it's a tiny, subtle way Lee uses to link all those ideas together. It also clarifies the hugely negative reaction many had to Go Set a Watchman, Lee's follow-up novel (which she actually wrote before Mockingbird), which was published in 2015 amid much mystery as to whether she had actually signed off on it. In that story, the simple fact of complicating Mockingbird's rather idyllic nostalgia — by pointing out the racist attitudes Atticus held as an old man and had likely always held — tarnished the idealized childhood presented in Mockingbird, which had always invited readers (who often first encountered it in high school) to conflate it with their own childhood memories at an age when it's remarkably easy to idealize childhood memories. Nostalgia is a powerful drug, and nobody likes having the trip interrupted. And there's another level here, too. Mockingbird isn't just a novel about a young woman looking back on her childhood. It's a novel about a young country looking back on some of its worst moments. The America of To Kill a Mockingbird is a sort of primal America. It's a small town, where kids can play outside until all hours of the night. It has weird local myths and legends. It even has its own supposedly scary boogeyman, who turns out to be nothing compared with the boogeymen hiding in plain sight. It's the America of national myth and presidential campaign ads, the place we are always trying to get back to. But Mockingbird gently complicates that picture. By far the most common complaints about the novel — complaints I largely share — stem from its treatment of Tom Robinson, who is simultaneously a bit of a stereotype and the kind of unbelievable saint who usually pops up in more hackneyed stories. (The latter, at least, is slightly more excusable because of the ""adult remembering childhood"" gambit. It's natural that the older Scout would simplify the supporting characters in her life in her memories.) Nostalgia always coats something we're consciously ignoring, if we're being honest with ourselves But Tom Robinson's unjust conviction also keeps Lee's portrayal of this nostalgic America from slipping entirely into hazy reverie. You can pretend this earlier America was a better, more honest place, but to do so would be like remembering your own childhood without all of the pain it inevitably included. Scout's beloved hometown could be the safe haven she loved to play in. It could also be a town that railroaded an innocent black man and sent him to his death. This is where Mockingbird ultimately transcends its flaws and becomes part of American myth itself. Written at the dawn of the 1960s — a decade that many have described as the end of America's innocence (or, if you will, its childhood) — the book is one of the few out there to gently confront America's long history of injustices but not feel like it's somehow chickening out in its gentility. Lee couches the story as a memory of childhood, but it's a dual childhood she's remembering — that of Scout and that of the country she lives in. This double layer of meaning keeps the book from ever tripping over itself and falling into vague allegory, though it constantly threatens to. We're all nostalgic for something, but that nostalgia always coats something we're consciously ignoring, if we're being honest with ourselves. Mockingbird came to define Lee in a way that she obviously did not anticipate. Over time, she became more and more of a recluse, and her only other contribution to literature while alive was the divisively received Watchman. But Mockingbird is touchstone enough to secure her place in the American literary legacy. It's at once a better and worse book than you might remember — worse because it has those flaws you may not have noticed as a teenager, and better because those flaws illuminate a complexity that was there all along, hiding in plain sight.",https://www.vox.com/2016/2/19/11071140/harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dead,,Vox

380,380,25-12-16 20:08,2016,12,25,Aidan Shevlin,PBOC's policy dilemma amidst a depreciating yuan,"The Chinese Renminbi (CNY) is the worst performing Asian currency this year, down 5.67% versus the USD (Fig. 1a & 1b). This marks the third year of declines with the red-back hitting an 8 year low. The pace of depreciation has actually increased in recent months with the currency lower by 1.94% in November this year as investors accelerate capital outflows to take advantage of better offshore opportunities whilst avoiding low onshore rates and further depreciation. In response, the government has introduced new capital controls and strengthened enforcement of existing ones. The combination of a weaker currency and new controls is creating significant challenges for Renminbi cash investors. Background One of the key steps towards capital account liberalization and Special Drawing Right (SDR) inclusion was loosening control of the currency. This was also a key trigger for other important on-shore reforms including interest rate liberalization and bond market reforms - which are now almost completed. However, ever since the CNY peaked at 6.04 against the USD in early 2014, the currency has been weakening. A combination of slower domestic growth and falling interest rates were the key reason for the depreciation following eight uninterrupted years of appreciation between 2005 and 2013. The pace of currency decline increased rapidly in August 2015 following the People's Bank of China's (PBoC) badly communicated ""one-off"" devaluation. Meanwhile, the YTD performance of the CNY is the worst in 22 years and investors expect further depreciation in 2017. Impact of current devaluation Faster capital outflows (FX reserves are down 873 billion since their June 2016 peak) have worried the government and reluctantly forced the PBoC to strengthen capital controls. However these tools are much less effective due to previous market liberalization steps and investors finding new ways to circumvent the rules. The capital outflows are also having a significant impact on domestic market liquidity. While a reserve requirement ratio cut would typically be used to support liquidity, the PBoC has refrained from cutting rates as this would be regarded as a further devaluation signal. Instead, the PBoC has focused on using open market operations (OMO) to ensure adequate liquidity. Total OMO outstanding recently hit a record high of over CNY 6 trillion. However, the PBoC is reluctant to increase this further as investors (bond funds and banks) have used the cheap and stable liquidity to leverage up wealth management, bond fund and trust products to boost returns (we hear anecdotally of leverage ratios of 4x to 6x), which has generated huge inflows into these asset classes, but also triggered concerns about the stability of the financial system. Recently, to discourage further leverage, the PBoC has increased repo funding costs - which has tightened onshore liquidity conditions (Fig 2), negatively impacted the equity and property markets and caused even more bond market volatility. But on a positive note… However, it is worth noting the following factors: Firstly, there is little sign of panic in on-shore or off-shore bond and currency markets - helped by better communication by the central bank, compared to the surprise devaluation in August 2015. Secondly, USD strength has been a key trigger for CNY weakness, with the dollar stronger against most currencies amid expectations of rate hikes and fiscal stimulus. Finally, the new basket of currencies that the PBoC is targeting (CFETS index) has remained broadly steady over the past few months (Fig. 3). Conclusion Currency weakness, capital outflows and rate volatility are likely to persist in the near term. This will create challenges for the PBoC in managing the pace of depreciation while encouraging a reduction in system-wide leverage. So expect further negative headlines and even tighter capital controls. However, we believe the PBoC is much more experienced, better at communicating and has a broader range of tools available than in August 2014 or July 2013, which should hopefully help the central bank manage these conflicting goals.

Can’t you see with your eyes, feel with the hairs on your arms, sense, somewhere in your heart, hardened and shut off to the world by the barrier that “Basketball Science” built inside, that LeBron has exceeded the confines of the world your tiny eyes can see, and bonded with the deeper power of The Universe? He has left the world of mere “Titles” and “Wins” behind and has instead taken up the sigil of Nature’s Player, The Universe’s Representative on Hardwood.

386,386,09-08-18 15:20,2018,8,9,Aja Romano,Why we love shark movies,"News and reviews of 2019's biggest summer blockbuster films. Since Steven Spielberg’s 1975 film Jaws first ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster 41 years ago, sharks have been among summer cinema’s favorite perennial villains. They rank right up there with the alien from Alien and Sadako from The Ring in terms of habitually recurring evil forces with a single-minded purpose: to destroy everything in their path. There’s something so elemental and irresistible about the shark movie that over the course of the past few decades, it has become one of Hollywood’s most well-trodden paths to terror. The genre now spans a wide range of films, from classics like Jaws and Deep Blue Sea (yes, Deep Blue Sea is a classic) to serious indie projects like The Reef to sillier D-movie affairs like the Sharknado, Mega Shark, and Shark Attack franchises. And if you’re among its many fans, you know that the only thing that can cure shark movie fever is more shark movies. Lucky for you, there’s always another shark movie on the way. The genre’s newest man-eating — or in this case, Jason Statham-eating — entry swims into movie theaters this weekend, with the opening of the tongue-in-cheek mega-shark movie The Meg — just days before the sixth and final installment in the Sharknado franchise arrives with Sharknado 6: It’s About Time. But why sharks? Ordinarily, the prospect of watching Statham try to survive an oceanic disaster scenario would be only a so-so draw for moviegoers. But if you throw in a battle to the death against a giant megalodon — the huge prehistoric shark which has, in recent years, outsized the great white shark in terms of appeal — then obviously, we’re hooked. In real life, sharks are mainly non-aggressive creatures who barely resemble the evil killing machines they morph into onscreen. They’re anything but an unstoppable force — humans kill a staggering 100 million sharks each year, or 11,000 sharks every single hour, a jaw-dropping statistic that mainly results from the high demand for shark fin soup in some parts of the world. You’re statistically more likely to die from a lightning strike or a toppling vending machine than from a shark attack. So why are we so fascinated by shark movies, even though they barely represent reality and their plots tend to be incredibly repetitive? Oh, there are so many reasons. You may believe sharks are limited to the sea, but you are wrong. Thanks to the magic of cinema and the relative ease with which a shark fin can be CGI’d to pop out of something and move ominously toward the viewer, we don’t just have sea sharks. We also have sand sharks. Avalanche sharks. Sharks in a sharknado! Sharks in a sharkcano. (That one really happened.) Sharks in a blizzardnado! Sharks on land! Sharks in shark lake. Sharks in swamps. Sharks in the bayou. Sharks in apartments! Sharks at Sea World! Sharks on the Jersey Shore. Sharks at the Golden Gate Bridge! Sharks at the supermarket! Sharks in Japan. Sharks in bathtubs and puddles. Even sharks in the sky. Much like the 2006 Samuel L. Jackson film Snakes on a Plane relied on the surprise factor of slithering reptiles wreaking havoc at 30,000 feet, a crucial component of shark movies is sharks’ seemingly inherent knack for appearing where and when you least expect them: Just where are the sharks going to be lurking today? Spoiler alert: They are everywhere. If you don’t think your average shark is a super genius hell-bent on avenging the atrocities perpetuated against its species by the human race, you’ve never watched Jaws 3-D (mama shark seeks revenge against SeaWorld for killing her baby), Jaws 4: The Revenge (shark seeks revenge against Lorraine Gary’s character Ellen Brody, ostensibly for killing its shark family but more broadly for the sad and rapid demise of the entire Jaws franchise), Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus (shark seeks revenge on Jaleel White for Jaleel White’s entire acting career), or Deep Blue Sea (shark seeks revenge against scientists for experimenting on it). To wit: Please enjoy the following GIF from Deep Blue Sea, in which a shark holds a stretcher-bound Stellan Skarsgård captive underwater so that it can throw him against an underwater window in order to spite his grieving girlfriend: I mean, come on, who among us hasn’t wanted to throw Stellan Skarsgård against a window? Bring on the shark uprising! The shark can do what no other villainous horror movie creature really can: In addition to engaging in epic bite-offs against other creatures, it can combine with those other creatures to create animalia supervillains. Sure, Hollywood will invent a demonic vampire here and there, but you can’t really give a demonic vampire tentacles. That’s simply not the case with a shark. In the world of shark movies, if you create an undead demon sharktopus, that’s just the first act. Would you like your shark with one head or two? How about three? Would you like an actual prehistoric mega shark? How about a giant robot shark? Few, if any, animals have enjoyed such creative big-screen depictions as the noble shark. There are demonic sharks! Sharks with tentacles! Zombie sharks! This shark-horse! Ghost sharks! A shark that walks on land! And coming later in 2017, there will be flying sharks controlled by Nazi zombies! In other words, if part of the fun of any shark movie is rooted in the nervous anticipation of where and when a dangerous shark might appear, a significant number of shark movies up the ante by combining their shark threats with other things. Not only does this approach allow the sharks to travel farther and kill harder, it ensures an endless supply of shark movies, because Hollywood will never run out of shark-based combination hazards. Killer koala shark from Down Under? Done. Shark movies can be as minimalist or as full-scale as you want or need them to be. As Blake Lively illustrated in 2016’s The Shallows, shark movies can be a one-woman-versus-one-shark show where the shark is a threatening but largely implied presence. They can involve just two people facing off against a small but deadly herd of sharks (47 Meters Down, Open Water), a tiny ensemble of stranded swimmers trying to avoid getting picked off one by one (The Reef), or a full-scale cast with big-budget shark action like Shark Night 3-D or Dark Tide. And one of the best things about shark films, regardless of their scope, is that shark size has no correlation to shark excellence — as anyone who actually saw Shark Night 3-D or Dark Tide can attest. The bigger shark doesn’t always have the better bite. In fact, films like Open Water and The Reef can succeed without showing any sharks at all. Believing they’re there is all that matters. On the other end of the spectrum, the first appearance of a shark — it’s always bigger than you were expecting, no matter the film — never gets old: This is a pretty obvious reason, but it remains the most compelling of all. Stories pitting man against the terrors of the deep have always been a mainstay of human folklore, from the biblical fable of Jonah and the whale to nautical tales of the great kraken, from Moby Dick to The Old Man and the Sea to Lovecraft’s tentacle monster Cthulhu to Disney’s Pinocchio. Each of these narratives involves great sea creatures that provide opportunities for heroes to face their fears, come to terms with their humanity, and, you know, be manly men who fish and hunt and conquer the wilderness. But as formidable opponents, many of these sea creatures lack a significant, shall we say, bite. Giant squid generally stay too far below the surface to really pose a viable threat to humans. Even a big swordfish is no match for a skilled modern fisherman — and the swordfish wouldn’t want to eat you anyway. As for whales, the bigger they are, the more peaceful and harmless they seem to be. Even the ones with teeth are passive and don’t really want to hurt you (unless they’ve been subjected to lifelong animal cruelty). Sharks, by contrast, are big. They have teeth — sometimes really big, really sharp teeth! They come into the shallow parts of the ocean where humans like to swim and play. Because they are drawn to loud noises and activity in the water, it’s possible, if not probable, that they could be lurking in the water where your loved ones are splashing around. They’re durable and intimidating, and even though in real life sharks are almost never aggressive toward humans, the biggest ones have the power and the potential to chomp you in two. In sum: Like all man-versus-nature tropes, man-versus-shark movies — and man-versus-sharks-versus-other-creatures movies — can reveal important truths about human nature and serve as fascinating, in-depth character studies. Unlike most other man-versus-nature tropes, they do it with a side of terrifying, razor-sharp teeth. Sharks combine mankind’s desire to conquer nature with its fear of and fascination with the mysteries of the ocean. Even in this modern age, when we’ve been able to plumb the depths of the seas, we still know surprisingly little about sharks. Jaws’ famous description of a shark’s ""cold, dead eyes, like a doll’s eyes"" in the film’s USS Indianapolis monologue (which was based on the real sinking of a US World War II Navy ship and subsequent shark attacks on its sailors) is still a testament to how unknowable they are. In essence, in fiction if not in real life, sharks are the perfect scary force of nature: an ever-present threat waiting to happen, in a deep blue setting that humans are still learning to navigate. But when all is said and done? As with all great horror movie villains, ultimately we’re always rooting for the shark.",https://www.vox.com/2016/6/24/11966440/why-we-love-shark-movies,,Vox
387,387,15-07-18 00:00,2018,7,15,,Turkey issues presidential decrees reshaping institutions,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey issued presidential decrees on Sunday reshaping key political, military and bureaucratic institutions as part of the transformation to a powerful executive presidency triggered by last month’s election.  President Tayyip Erdogan was sworn in on Monday under the new system and now holds sweeping powers, allowing him to issue decrees on executive matters and appoint and remove senior civil servants.  Erdogan has said the powerful executive presidency is vital to make government more efficient, drive economic growth and ensure security. Critics decry what they say is increasing authoritarianism and a push toward one-man rule.  Among the latest changes, the General Staff was brought under the authority of the defense minister, according to state-run Anadolu news agency, a move following Erdogan’s appointment of military commander Hulusi Akar as defense minister.  In total, the country’s Official Gazette published seven decrees affecting many state institutions, including the secretariat of the National Security Council, the Defence Industry Directorate and the State Supervisory Council.  The changes coincide with the second anniversary of an attempted coup during which at least 250 people were killed, many of them unarmed civilians, when rogue soldiers attempted to topple Erdogan’s government.  A state of emergency was imposed after the failed putsch on July 15, 2016 and is set to expire this week.  Erdogan’s AK Party and its nationalist ally plan to introduce security regulations to ensure the “fight against terrorism” will continue after emergency rule ends, two sources told Reuters.

388,388,05-07-17 12:30,2017,7,5,Alexia Fernández Campbell,Hundreds of thousands of workers could lose their jobs if Senate health bill passes,"CHICAGO — From their offices in a crumbling former nursing school, Aimee Dinschel and Michelle Pihlaja-Olson were preparing to interview 25 applicants for public health jobs. It should have been a moment of optimism for their hospital system, which only recently began to turn a profit after more than a century of bleeding money, and which was expanding its services to the poorest residents of Cook County. Instead, the women were worried. The health care bill moving through the Senate, and particularly its rollback of Medicaid, would threaten millions of dollars of funding for the county hospital system here. It could end mental health and behavioral services for low-income patients. And it has cast a pall of uncertainty over hospital staff: Dinschel and Pihlaja-Olson could not be sure that the jobs they were hiring for would still exist in a few years. They weren’t sure their own positions would exist, either. “What if we don’t have jobs in a year?” said Dinschel, a mother of two who is the main income earner in her family. It’s a question she’s considered several times since the election. “It’s hard to find a job, and this is a good position.” Dinschel and Pihlaja-Olson, who manage health care for Medicaid enrollees, are among 300 workers and contractors for the Cook County health system whose jobs rely on the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. The morning we spoke, Republican senators had unveiled the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which would cut federal funding to cover Medicaid expansion for low-income Americans who qualified for the program for the first time under Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 22 million fewer Americans would have insurance under that plan. But health coverage isn’t the only thing at stake. The Senate bill could slash hundreds of thousands of jobs and stunt growth in an industry that has boosted post-recession job creation. It’s unclear exactly how many jobs are on the line. But public health experts at George Washington University estimate that 912,000 health care workers in the United States could lose their jobs if Congress rolls back the Medicaid expansion and removes tax credits to help people buy private insurance. (The BCRA phases out Medicaid expansion and caps, but does not eliminate, tax credits). Illinois is one of 31 states that chose to expand Medicaid coverage with federal dollars from Obamacare. It received $3.2 billion in federal funding to do so in fiscal year 2015. If the Senate bill passes, it could be one of the states with the highest number of job losses, according to the analysis. The law would also strain public budgets. Fewer people with insurance means more people show up at the emergency room who can’t afford their care. As patients worry about the possibility of losing their insurance in a post-Obamacare world, public hospitals have another worry too: that they’ll return to the bad old days of financial instability, costs that are eventually passed along to taxpayers. Mary Sajdak, who oversees about 60 care coordinators who work with Medicaid enrollees in Cook County, choked up when she described the calls she gets from patients who are frightened about losing their health care. “When you see what years and years of untreated chronic disease does to a person, then you give them a chance, and give them a prescription card, it makes their poverty less isolating,” she said, wiping away tears. “To give that to people and then take it away, it makes me profoundly sad.” Cook County’s public hospitals have treated Chicago’s poorest residents for more than 100 years. The vast system includes John Stroger Jr. Hospital in West Chicago, the inspiration for the TV show ER, which has one of the busiest emergency rooms in the country. For most of the hospital’s history, the majority of the patients it served had no health insurance at all. When they needed to see a doctor, they went to the emergency room. Under federal law, hospitals cannot turn away someone in a medical emergency, even if they don’t have health insurance and cannot pay. Cook County hospitals charge uninsured patients based on their income — anywhere from zero to 50 percent of their total medical bill. Local taxpayers end up subsidizing the rest. In 2009, right before passage of the Affordable Care Act, about 53 percent of the system’s patients were uninsured, costing county taxpayers more than $500 million. After the ACA expanded Medicaid coverage in 2014, providing health insurance to hundreds of thousands more people, the county hospital system broke even for the first time. About two-thirds of the hospital system’s patients now have health insurance, mostly because of the Medicaid expansion, says Dr. Jay Shannon, CEO of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. Shannon said the influx of nearly $200 million in Medicaid revenue has helped the hospital hire extra staff, such as psychologists and behavioral health specialists who work with patients to identify — and change — behaviors that are hurting their health, such as smoking, drug use, or unhealthy eating. That includes dozens of social workers, such as Dinschel and Pihlaja-Olson, who have helped Medicaid enrollees navigate the health care system and use preventive care services. “The changes have been very, very striking for us,” said Shannon, whose office is not far from the construction site of a nine-story medical facility, which will replace the county’s dilapidated community clinic and administrative offices. But Shannon may soon have to make some difficult choices. He is closely watching what Republicans in Congress are doing to replace Obamacare, and has serious concerns that both the House and Senate want to eliminate the Medicaid expansion. If that happens, he will have to cut back somewhere. “I have to keep the lights in the hospital on; I have to keep the surgeon on call,” he said. “I may have to pull back on care coordination and mental health support. We would have to put off overdue investments in capital. These are the kinds of tough decisions we have to make.” Cook County commissioners are panicking as well. They don’t have the money to subsidize uninsured patients if they are kicked off Medicaid. Larry Suffredin, a county commissioner for 15 years, said rolling back the Medicaid expansion could cost the county up to $400 million a year. Right now, he said, the savings from Medicaid have been funneled into the county courts, jails, and sheriff’s office. Suffredin said the commission will not raise taxes, but doesn’t know how else to keep people on Medicaid if Congress takes away the federal money. If the time comes, Suffredin hopes the state will step in and help. But the chance of that happening doesn’t look good. The state of Illinois is in the midst of one of the worst financial crises in its history, and is struggling to balance its budget. Suffredin said it’s frustrating to see lawmakers in Washington, DC, be so irresponsible with their politics. “You can’t just put the genie back in the bottle,” he said. “This is not a simple accounting exercise. Every decision they are making has an impact on people’s health and public safety.” Dinschel and Pihlaja-Olson both chose careers as social workers because they wanted to do something meaningful with their lives. Dinschel, a native of Chicago, was passionate about social justice issues in college and realized that she could make a career working with people whom others often overlooked. She got a master’s degree in social work, got married, had two daughters, and worked for years helping homeless residents find food and housing. Soon, many of her colleagues began getting jobs in the field of health care coordination — a field that began growing after Illinois expanded Medicaid with money from the Affordable Care Act. In 2016, Dinschel got a job in the industry too. She started working as a care coordinator for high-risk Medicaid patients in Cook County. The job paid better, she said, and had great benefits. And it wasn’t so different from what she did before. Instead of helping homeless people find food and housing, she was helping low-income Americans get medical care and live healthier lives. “When I am doing something to help others, it’s more than just a job,” said Dinschel, sipping a tangerine LaCroix after several back-to-back meetings with her staff. She now manages a staff of 10 care coordinators. Pihlaja-Olson has a similar story. She used to work with victims of domestic violence before she was recruited by Cook County around the same time that Dinschel switched jobs. She said it’s important that her three sons learn to have empathy for people, and she hopes she is setting an example for them. As a care coordinator, Pihlaja-Olson screened Medicaid enrollees for potential chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or even cancer. Many of them had never had health insurance before, so they needed to unlearn the habit of using the emergency room for medical care. “We basically had to teach some people how to use health care. How to make an appointment, how to use their insurance cards,” said Pihlaja-Olson, who had just come back from the county jail, where she was starting a pilot program to get inmates drug addiction treatment. She also supervises a staff of 10 social workers, nurses, and community health workers. After Trump won the election, some employees started asking Pihlaja-Olson if they would lose their jobs. She didn’t know what to say. “I just said, ‘You’re okay for now,’ and tried to calm people’s fears.” She doesn’t even know what will happen to her job. “I think I could find another job,” said Pihlaja-Olson, who, like Dinschel, is her family’s main income earner. “But I worry a lot about the staff that I supervise and whether they will have jobs.” Dinschel, who was seated next to her in a conference room, nodded. It used to worry her a lot more, she said, but now she just feels weary about the news surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Down the hall, their boss seemed weary too. “The inconsistency we’ve been living with is hard,” said Sajdak, who oversees care management for the health and hospital system. “How do you plan for something like this?” She said she would do everything possible to prove to hospital executives that health care coordinators are invaluable. After all, she said, they develop plans with each Medicaid enrollee to make sure they get regular care and see their doctors, which ends up saving hospitals more money in the long run. “If we can show that we can reduce hospitalization rates, then we might be able to survive. Hope is not really a plan,” she said at her office next to Stroger Hospital. In the past few months, Sajdak has had to reassure her employees that she is committed to keeping them on staff. But she acknowledges that even her job isn’t safe. “I was hoping to finish my career seeing [the Affordable Care Act] bloom and grow,” she said. “I don’t know if I will.”",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/5/15873438/senate-health-bill-job-losses,,Vox

Numerous H-6K bombers and other jets recently flew through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines and the Miyako Strait in Japan’s south, and also over the South China Sea on a “combat patrol”, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke.  Shen did not say when the drills began but said all planes had finished their patrols on Thursday, which were intended to “improve maritime real combat capabilities and forge the forces’ battle methods”.  China has been increasingly asserting itself in territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. It is also worried about Taiwan, run by a government China fears is intent on independence.  Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring proudly democratic Taiwan under its control, and has warned that any moves towards formal independence could prompt an armed response.  China is in the midst of an ambitious military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and developing stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.

390,390,16-06-16 14:15,2016,6,16,,"""I Can No Longer Be Scared of What People Think"": Coeur de Pirate Takes Personal Stand on Orlando Shootings","Photo by Béatrice Martin On June 12, one of the worst shootings in history of the United States occurred at gay nightclub Pulse, in Orlando, Florida. It is heartbreaking to note that this tragedy, unfortunately, coincides with Pride Month. Béatrice Martin, otherwise known as Coeur de Pirate is an indie pop artist from Montréal. The 26-year-old singer, songwriter, and mother felt this traumatic experience particularly deeply. Below is an open letter she wrote:  It’s Sunday morning in Paris. I hop on Twitter, still reeling from the events that took place the day before when a former finalist on The Voice was gunned down while signing autographs. As I see my feed unravel, I realize another mass shooting has taken place in a nightclub. The horror, the disgust, comes swinging like a punch to the stomach. Omar Mateen has killed 49 people in a gay bar. I feel sick, I feel powerless. It is one of the worst mass shootings in American history, fuelled by a plethora of complicated issues: homophobia, possible terrorist group affiliation, domestic terrorism. But the fundamental issue is that an LGBTQ community has been explicitly targeted and murdered. This was a place where these victims were supposed to feel safe; where they were celebrating their identity and someone had decided to violate that yet again. All of a sudden, I remembered the Paris attacks in November of last year and the paranoia that settled in, that still permeates the country. I was on tour at the time, in France, and had to cancel concerts for the safety of my fans and myself. It’s one thing to say that you have to keep going, but the fear and anxiety still lingers when the places you perform in or feel comfortable going to are attacked. Come to think of it, the Orlando shootings had another impact, because some families must have learned about a loved one’s true sexuality along with their deaths. The victims were robbed of the choice to come out on their own terms. In response to the news, social media became full of hashtags like #gaysbreaktheinternet and #queersbreaktheinternet to publicly come out in support of. I thought it was wonderful: why hide who you are? In a world where, in certain countries, being gay is still punishable by death, it’s important to take a stand. The internet is a beautiful place sometimes. That’s when I started feeling like a hypocrite. The whole situation made me wonder if I was considering myself honest. I had been going through many changes as well. As a public figure, I’ve always wondered what my position should be about my private life: what should I say or not say? Sure, it’s my “private” life, I can say whatever I want, but truthfully there is some good in being honest. This is not just for me but for the people that consider me someone who is cool and awesome. At least, I try to be. My first romantic thoughts were about a girl I knew. I didn’t quite understand it at the time because I was 6 or 7 years old, but I remember the girl’s parents calling my parents to tell them that I was going overboard with the phone calls and the attention. I liked her, I really liked her. I was always reading a lot of manga at that age, specifically Sailor Moon, where lesbian love was celebrated in a subtle way. Additionally, some of the Sailor Scouts dressed up in men’s clothes, and it was awesome. It was enlightening. Sometimes you didn’t know if someone was a girl or a boy. It was beyond what most seven-year-olds were thinking about. That being said, as I grew up and saw how people interacted, it became clear to me that it was considered weird to like someone from the same sex. One of my first crushes was a girl and the second she heard about it, she started ignoring me. For anyone, that’s traumatizing. I resented the fact that liking someone of the same sex was not widely accepted. I settled for a heterosexual lifestyle because I was scared of rejection. After years of being awkward both in bed and in relationships, I settled down, buried all of my feelings deep inside, had a kid, and thought things were going to be alright. I was completely wrong. Whatever I had repressed all those years came rushing back the second after I gave birth. I started disassociating. Whenever I had any form of contact with anyone, I would feel used and helpless. So I tried to detach myself from whatever was going on, physically and mentally. As someone that was realizing all of this later in life, I felt like a complete fraud. It is clear that with the Orlando attack homophobia is still very much present and a concern. Even with the internet, the open debates on horrible bills like North Carolina’s HB2 that are being passed in this day and age it is still fact that loving the person that you want to love comes with a price. That is why I’m coming out as queer today; because I can no longer be scared of what people might think about me. I can’t be scared that someone will stop listening to my music, or that parents might not want their kids listening to me because of the fact that I want to love whoever I want to love. I’m coming out for my daughter who needs to learn that love knows no race, religion, gender or orientation. Even though the family that she knew in the very beginning won’t be the same, she deserves all of the love that she needs or wants. I’m coming out for the victims that lost their lives because they wanted to celebrate who they truly were. It isn’t easy for me to write any of this, but I know that some good can come out of it. I’m sure that if you’re not in a big city, and that you feel scared to come to terms with who you really are, what happened in Orlando can scare you to become the person you were meant to be. This is my message to you, as someone that was terrified as well, that I found solace in my difference. Béatrice Martin is a singer and songwriter from Montreal.

391,391,04-05-19 13:38,2019,5,4,Kelly Cohen,Boeing 737 crash: all safe after St. Johns River crash in Jacksonville,"A Boeing 737 with 143 people aboard slid off a runway into a shallow river in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday night as pilots attempted a landing in the middle of a thunderstorm. All 136 passengers and seven flight crew members on board are alive and accounted for, although 21 adults were transported to local hospitals with minor injuries, officials said. Officials did not immediately say what caused the plane to leave the runway and go into the St. Johns River. The plane, a chartered Boeing 737-800, was arriving from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to Naval Air Station Jacksonville at about 9:40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time when the incident occurred, a spokesman for the Florida air base said. Capt. Michael P. Connor, the commanding officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, said at a news conference that “the cause of the mishap has yet to be determined” and praised the skill of the first responders on the scene. “We could be talking about a different story this evening. So there’s a lot to say about the professionalism of the folks that helped the passengers off the airplane,” Conor said early Saturday. “Some of them were coming back to see their families, some of them were continuing on travel to their homes outside of Florida.” #JSO Marine Unit was called to assist @NASJax_ in reference to a commercial airplane in shallow water. The plane was not submerged. Every person is alive and accounted for. pic.twitter.com/4n1Fyu5nTS The mayor of Jacksonville, Lenny Curry, said on Twitter that President Donald Trump called him to offer help as the situation was “developing.” “No fatalities reported. We are all in this together,” Curry said in a separate tweet. 7. No fatalities reported. We are all in this together. Absorb that. Passenger Cheryl Bormann told CNN’s Don Lemon the plane flew through lightning and thunderstorms on the way to Jacksonville. “As we went down, we had a really hard landing,” Bormann said. “And then the plane bounced and screeched and bounced some more ... then it came to a complete like crash stop.” Bormann said passengers had no idea where they were at first. “We were in water. We couldn’t tell where we were, whether it was a river or an ocean. There was rain coming down. There was lightning and thunder. And we stood on that wing for a significant period of time. Rescue folks came and eventually someone inflated a life raft that had been on the plane and we began climbing into it. Everybody was helping everybody,” she said. The flight was operated by Miami Air International, a charter airline with a fleet of Boeing 737-800s, that is contracted by the military for its twice-weekly “rotator” roundtrip service between the US mainland and Guantanamo Bay, said Bill Dougherty, a spokesperson for the base in Jacksonville. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the cause of the crash. The NTSB is sending a Go Team to investigate Miami Air International flight 293, a Boeing 737-800, which departed runway and came to rest in St. Johns River, Jacksonville, Florida (no reported fatalities). While the plane involved in the Jacksonville incident is a Boeing 737, it is not a 737 Max, the plane involved in two deadly crashes less than six months apart. Those crashes are currently under investigation by the Department of Justice as the airplane manufacture retools the plane. In a statement released on Twitter, Boeing said it is cooperating with the NTSB’s investigation into the Jacksonville crash. pic.twitter.com/w5Xs9H1kwt",https://www.vox.com/2019/5/4/18529202/boeing-737-plane-crash-jacksonville-florida,,Vox
392,392,06-05-16 00:00,2016,5,6,Allison Meier,The Forgotten Artistic Playgrounds of the 20th Century,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads No matter if your childhood playground had a rusted metal slide that was scorching hot in summer or a sleek and safe structure of soft plastic climbing walls and swings, it’s likely that you created your own narrative of play. Maybe the jungle gym was a pirate ship, or the slide a mountain, but grownups watching only saw chaos. Following World War II, and up to stricter playground regulations in the 1980s, artists, architects, and designers imagined new playgrounds that fostered this fluid creativity. Rather than equipment with implied actions (like a slide), they built abstract, climbable sculptures, landscapes of peaks and tunnels, and sometimes just concoctions of debris in a vacant lot where children could build whatever environment they desired. These “adventure playgrounds” contrasted to the sort of holding-pen playgrounds of the 19th century that arose with the social reform movement. And in Europe, where many cities were pocked with postwar rubble, adventure playgrounds could be temporarily installed in these vacant lots, utilizing their raw materials. Landscape architect Marjory Allen in London, for instance, was an advocate for adventure playgrounds, including one at a bomb site at Clydesdale Road in 1952. Meanwhile in the United States, the sprawl of the suburbs, and decline of urban downtowns, required a new perspective on designing vibrant public space. The Playground Project, out now with essays in German and English from JRP-Ringier, explores this era of artistic play. Edited by city planner Gabriela Burkhalter, the publication developed from her years of research on this overlooked history (which you can also explore online). Burkhalter curated a 2013 show on playgrounds at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Museum of Art, which evolved into the larger Playground Project exhibition now at Kunsthalle Zürich. Burkhalter writes that as “hardly anyone sees playgrounds as part of their cultural heritage, much of their history has been forgotten.” She adds that there have been “four paradigm shifts” in the playground over the past 150 years: First, at the beginning of the 20th century, social reformers took children off the street and onto the playground. Then, at the beginning of the 1930s, the idea arose that children should play with natural materials rather than playground equipment. In the 1960s, the decade of autonomy and do-it-yourself, parents, children, and neighborhood groups began to take charge of playgrounds themselves. Finally, in the 1980s, with the end of social and political utopias, a crisis in playground design began. Photographer Brenda Biondo, in discussing her 2014 book Once Upon a Playground: A Celebration of Classic American Playgrounds, 1920-1975, echoed the assertion that this aspect of the built environment hasn’t been widely considered. “So many Americans grew up playing on this stuff, and it’s a part of Americana, but nobody was documenting it, nobody was collecting it,” she told Hyperallergic. So why should we care about the playground? As Burkhalter argues in The Playground Project, playgrounds are a meeting point of both modernism and a distinctly 20th-century perspective on childhood. From boxer, sculptor, and Princeton University professor Joseph Brown’s spiderweb structures of ropes and springs that encouraged collaborative play, to the interconnected orbs made from recycled materials by Group Ludic in France, playgrounds were also a global movement in radically rethinking public space. Many playground designers were inspired by sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Although none of the New York City playgrounds he started designing in the 1930s were realized — due in large part to Parks Commissioner Robert Moses who preferred his own repeating metal bar-based playgrounds — Noguchi’s concepts of sculptural environments influenced later figures like Richard Dattner. Dattner’s five 1960s to ’70s playgrounds, built in a post-Moses New York, endure with their interactive landscapes in Central Park, albeit renovated for a newly litigious age. Burkhalter notes that they’ve “lost much of their original idiosyncrasy when they were adapted to meet contemporary security standards; for example, tactile sand was replaced by a soft plastic surface.” Landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg was likewise inspired by Noguchi in erecting playgrounds with the New York Housing Authority, such as the rambling hills of stone and concrete at the Jacob Riis Houses and a climbable sculpture at the Carver Houses in Spanish Harlem, rather than the originally planned untouchable piece of art. Noguchi finally had his first American playground completed in 1976 with “Playscapes” in Atlanta, commissioned by the High Museum of Art. This collaboration between institutions and artists was essential for making art playgrounds a reality, with groups such as Creative Playthings involving artists like Danish sculptor Egon Möller-Nielsen in the 1950s to produce playground sculptures available to order from catalogues, even coordinating a play sculpture competition with the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1954. Richard W. Crawford, Philadelphia’s Commissioner of Recreation, led the installation of several play sculptures by Möller-Nielsen and others in his city. Even the much smaller municipality of my hometown, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, commissioned architect Bruce Goff to build the recently restored 1963 “Play Tower,” based on the idea of a Möbius strip, with an accompanying climbable sculpture alongside. Children were encouraged to run up and down the stairs of the Space Age-styled tower, making as much noise as possible to rattle its steel cage. “The abstract playground sculptures fit the mood of the age, which wanted to promote creativity in children,” Burkhalter writes. “The supply grew, and soon it was good form for city governments to install playground sculptures, even if mass production led to more and more banal designs.” Playgrounds today don’t have that same freedom of experimentation, especially since the 1981 publication of the US Consumer Safety Commission’s Guidelines for Playground Safety. Yet there is a recent revival of interest in art playgrounds. Last year’s The Brutalist Playground at the Royal Institute of British Architects involved a playscape designed by Assemble and artist Simon Terrill that celebrated the postwar playground landscape. And an adventure playground recently had a successful Kickstarter campaign to be constructed in New York. None of these individual projects is quite like what happened in the mid-20th century, when the playground, from Japan to Stockholm, was reborn as a place of artistic experimentation. Children in some ways have different lives today, often much more structured after-school activities, with free time frequently filled with passive activities on digital devices. Still, the innovative ideas presented in The Playground Project respond to the universal enthusiasm in children for play, and show that even just a well-placed corner filled with sand, or a sculpture you can crawl into rather than keep behind barriers can make public space an active part of children’s lives. The Playground Project is out now from JRP-Ringier. The Playground Project continues at Kunsthalle Zürich (Limmatstrasse 270, Zürich, Switzerland) through May 15.",https://hyperallergic.com/295172/the-forgotten-artistic-playgrounds-of-the-20th-century/,,Hyperallergic

394,394,23-01-18 00:00,2018,1,23,"Greg Torode, Philip Wen","As U.S. goes quiet on close naval patrols, China speaks out","HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - While the Pentagon plays down patrols close to Chinese-controlled reefs and islands in the South China Sea, Beijing is sounding the alarm about them, seeking to justify what experts say will be an even greater presence in the disputed region.  Chinese officials publicized the latest U.S. “freedom of navigation patrol”, protesting the deployment last week of the destroyer USS Hopper to within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Shoal, an atoll west of the Philippines which Beijing disputes with Manila.  It was the second time in recent months that confirmation of a patrol came from Beijing, not Washington, which had previously announced or leaked details.  Bonnie Glaser, a security expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said while the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had a policy of  keeping the patrols regular but low key, China was willing to publicly exploit them to further their military ends.  “It is difficult to conclude otherwise,” she said. “Even as it pushes ahead with these (patrols), I don’t think the Trump administration has really come to terms with what it will tolerate from China in the South China Sea, and what it simply won’t accept, and Beijing seems to grasp this.”  In official statements, Chinese foreign ministry official Lu Kang said China would take “necessary measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty” in the resource-rich sea.  Some regional diplomats and security analysts believe that will involve increased Chinese deployments and the quicker militarization of China’s expanded facilities across the Spratlys archipelago.  While U.S. officials did not target China in their comments, couching freedom-of-navigation patrols as a “routine” assertions of international law, Beijing was quick to cast Washington as the provocateur.  The Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper on Monday accused the U.S. of upsetting recent peace and co-operation and “wantonly provoking trouble”, saying China had must now strengthen its presence in the strategic waterway.  In recent years, China has built up several reefs and islets into large-scale airstrips and bases as it seeks to assert and enforce its claims to much of the sea, through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan, hold rival claims.  Chinese coastguard and People’s Liberation Army navy ships patrol vast swathes of the South China Sea, routinely shadowing U.S. and other international naval deployments, regional naval officers say.  Zhang Baohui, a mainland security analyst at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, told Reuters he believed Beijing was rattled by Trump’s sharpening Asia strategy and they might be tempted to react in the South China Sea, even after months of relative calm.  “We can perhaps expect the Chinese to push ahead with militarization as retaliation,” he said.  A new U.S. national defense strategy unveiled last week stressed the need to counter the rising authoritarian powers of China and Russia, outlining a need to better support allies and newer partners against coercion.  While most analysts and regional envoys believe China remains keen to avoid an actual conflict with the significantly more powerful U.S. navy in the South China Sea, it is working to close the gap.  China has added bunkers, hangars and advanced radars on its new runways in the Spratlys, although it has not fully equipped them with the advanced surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles they use to protect the Paracels grouping further north.  Similarly, Beijing has yet to land jet fighters in the Spratlys - test flights some experts are expecting this year.  The latest patrol was at least the fifth such patrol under the Trump administration and the first to Scarborough - one of the more contentious features in the region.  Scarborough, once a U.S. bombing range, was blockaded by the Chinese in 2012, prompting the Philippines to launch its successful legal case in the Hague against China’s excessive territorial claims.   China allowed Filipino fishermen back to Scarborough’s rich waters last year, but it remains a potential flashpoint as both sides claim sovereignty and China maintains a steady presence of ships nearby.  While experts and regional envoys expect China to ramp up operations from the Spratlys, none expect it to build on Scarborough - something widely believed to be a red line that would provoke the United States, given its long-standing security treaty with the Philippines.   Shi Yinhong, who heads the Center for American Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University, said China had “lived with” U.S. patrols for several years but the key facts on the ground remained in China’s favor and broader tensions had “improved remarkably”.  “These islands, especially those with reclaimed land and military capability already deployed, they’re still in Chinese hands,” Shi, who has advised the Chinese government on diplomacy, told Reuters.   “I don’t think Trump has the stomach and the guts to change this fundamental status quo.”  (This story has been refiled to correct typo in paragraph 5)   Reporting By Greg Torode in Hong Kong and Philip Wen in Beijing; Editing by Lincoln Feast",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china/as-u-s-goes-quiet-on-close-naval-patrols-china-speaks-out-idUSKBN1FC0JK,World News,Reuters
395,395,21-04-16 16:00,2016,4,21,Dylan Matthews,This chart shows just how skewed our autism funding priorities are,"One point that autistic people like myself have been hammering since the rise of the autism rights movement is that charities devoted to the condition focus on the wrong thing. There's a huge emphasis on preventing or even ""curing"" autism, even though we're nowhere near being able to do either, and many autistic people resent the idea that their psychological differences are in need of ""curing."" And a new report finds that this problem isn't going away. In fact, it's getting worse. The report found that autism funding in 2011 and 2012 was heavily tilted toward researching the underlying biology and risk factors contributing to autism, and away from ways to help actual autistic people. A mere 7 percent went to researching services for autistic people, and 1 percent to researching the needs of autistic adults: The report was issued by the Office of Autism Research Coordination (OARC) and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), a branch of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that coordinates federal autism policy. They included not just funding from federal agencies (the National Institutes of Health being the biggest, but the CDC, EPA, National Science Foundation, and more as well) but from private organizations like the Simons Foundation and Autism Speaks. The government and foundations spent about $300 million on autism research in 2011, and $332 million in 2012, with about 78 percent coming from the federal government and the rest from private foundations. Jus 30 percent — $100 million — went to biology in 2012, and another 17 percent to risk factors. The trendlines are concerning as well. While research into the biology of autism has been shooting up… …services research remains far behind: It's hard to know what's worse: If services research suddenly jumped in 2010 only to fall far and quickly in 2011 and 2012 (as the original data suggests) or if it's always been considerably below other priorities (as adjusted data, correcting for exaggerated 2010 figures, shows). The original data is screwy because OARC started counting non-research projects, like teacher training and professional education, in the research analysis. Without that creative accounting, services research spending was always low. The relatively high funding of ""treatment"" research is encouraging until you dig deeper. A third of treatment funding went to ""development of animal models that can be used for understanding molecular and neural pathways that can be targeted by interventions""; this is much closer to core biological research than research into services. Only 10 percent of treatment funding went to evaluating the effectiveness of community-based services in assisting autistic people. If anything, the numbers are worse if you just limit yourself to NIH. As the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, a leading autism rights group, notes, ""In 2012, services-research was 1.82% of the NIH investment while research on adults reached a historic low of 0.9% – less than one percent."" In a statement, Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, declared that the numbers ""show a shocking lack of interest in aligning scientific investment in autism research to the priorities of the most important stakeholders: autistic people ourselves."" Of course, there's nothing wrong with learning more about the biology of autism, and there's nothing wrong with trying to figure out how to treat or reverse its more debilitating effects (like self-harm) and co-morbid conditions (autists are at elevated risk of epilepsy, for example). In a perfect world, there'd be plenty of funding for each of these areas. But given the government and foundations' limited budgets, many autism advocates have argued that this funding would be better spent researching how to help autistic people alive now. That could bring more immediate, tangible benefits to people on the autism spectrum.",https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11464144/autism-funding-services-biology,,Vox

398,398,20-08-16 13:00,2016,8,20,Peter Suderman ,"The new Ben-Hur remake strips an iconic story of its style, message, and purpose","There aren’t many surprises in the new Ben-Hur. It’s a noisy, dull, thoroughly soulless affair built on banal dialogue, flat acting, and slapdash computer-generated imagery that barely looks better than your average Playstation game. It does nothing that its source material — namely the 1959 MGM epic Ben-Hur and the 1880 Lew Wallace novel it was based on — didn’t do better, and does lots of things worse. In other words, it’s almost exactly the movie you’d expect from the director of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Rating The most baffling thing about the new Ben-Hur is why it was made at all. Why remake one of Hollywood’s most enduring and iconic productions? And why remake it with director Timur Bekmambetov at the helm? The result is a remake with no guiding principle beyond mere existence. Remakes, as a category, don’t always have the best reputation, and are frequently derided as signs of Hollywood’s creative bankruptcy. That’s not totally unfair — especially given how many turn out like this year’s Ben-Hur. But the best remakes show us how cinematic do-overs can work, and in some cases even improve on their originals, by expanding on the ideas of their source material. The key to a successful remake is making it relevant and accessible to new and different audiences. Take a movie like The Thing, John Carpenter’s 1982 sci-fi/horror classic. It’s based on science fiction writer John W. Campbell’s 1938 novella Who Goes There?, as well as on the 1951 Howard Hawks film version The Thing From Another World. All three versions share the same core premise: While isolated in icy Antarctica, a group of men encounter an alien creature that can take the form of any creature it kills. But Carpenter’s outrageously gory film emphasizes the physical horror of the creature’s violence, as well as the psychological terror and trauma of not knowing who might be an enemy in disguise. It wasn’t just a modernized treatment of the Howard Hawks version; it was very, very much a John Carpenter film. The same goes for most successful remakes. In contrast to, say, the joyless recent remakes of The Day the Earth Stood Still and Total Recall — both of which seem to have been made simply for the sake of rolling out a new film with a familiar name — successful cinematic updates tend to be driven by exceptional filmmakers and strong visions more than by the legacy of the original properties. Think of movies like the Coen brothers’ quirky, existentialist version of True Grit; Steven Soderbergh’s jazzy new-Hollywood-royalty riff on Ocean’s Eleven; Brian de Palma’s hyper-stylish, hyper-violent Scarface; Martin Scorsese’s Boston crime take on The Departed; John Carpenter’s grim, urban reimagining of Rio Bravo or Assault on Precinct 13; or Terry Gilliam’s knotty, fatalistic sci-fi film 12 Monkeys. Some of those films drew on source material that was relatively unknown to American audiences: The Departed was based on the 2002 Hong Kong police thriller Infernal Affairs, and 12 Monkeys was inspired by the 1962 silent short film ""La Jetée."" The others were based on American films that would have been somewhat better known. But regardless of their predecessors' profiles, these new versions weren’t content to just repeat the formula that had worked before. Instead, they were made by directors with strong, consistent visions who wanted to put their own unique stamp on the material. That even goes for something like Steven Spielberg’s 2005 War of the Worlds remake. With its history, name recognition, and opportunities for massive special effects set pieces, it’s the sort of film you can easily imagine being adapted just for the sake of adapting it. But with its focus on failed fathers and broken families, dangerous radicals and social breakdown, human weakness and alien inscrutability, the version we got was recognizably Spielbergian. It was the product of a filmmaker’s distinctive taste and vision, a movie that works on its own terms, not as a faint reflection of the original. The 1959 version of Ben-Hur was itself a remake of a well-known 1925 silent film, which was itself a defining epic of the silent era and which followed a previous 1907 short film adaption. The first feature’s $3.9 million budget made it the most expensive silent film ever produced, and its climactic chariot race set a new standard for action scenes. When William Wyler, who worked on the set of the silent version, was brought on to direct the 1959 remake, his aim was to create a new epic on a scale that had never been accomplished before. Once again, the film boasted a record-breaking budget — some $15.9 million — which funded a mammoth production effort. Wyler shot for six days a week for almost eight months on a sprawling set, creating 100,000 costumes and more than a million different props in the process. There were more than 350 speaking parts in the movie, and thousands of extras. The script ran some 230 pages, and the final cut of the movie was more than three and a half hours long. Visually, the film is just as extravagant. It features two iconic action set pieces—an ancient naval battle and a grueling, deadly chariot race, both of which hold up today. The entire film was shot on bulky cameras using a process that gave the film an unusually wide 2.76:1 aspect ratio. (For comparison, most movies are displayed in either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 aspect ratios.) The ultra-widescreen format paid off during the famed chariot race sequence, allowing Wyler to easily capture multiple four-horse chariots side by side. Wyler’s Ben-Hur is far from perfect and hasn’t worn entirely well with age: It’s too long and too slow, too insistent on capturing its dialogue in medium shots that box its actors into the movie’s stage-like sets, too invested in Charlton Heston’s hammy performance. But it is a movie that more than justifies its own existence on scale and spectacle alone. It achieves — sometimes overachieves — the epic greatness to which it aspired. The new version, by contrast, lacks the scale of a typical episode of Game of Thrones. It was made for a reported $100 million, making its budget smaller than Wyler's, which, adjusted for inflation, was equal to about $131 million in today's dollars. Indeed, the remake is smaller and less spectacular in just about every way. The 2016 Ben-Hur is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, a Kazakh filmmaker who, in addition to helming a movie about the slave-freeing president who fought a secret army of vampires, also directed the 2008 comic book adaptation Wanted. Bekmambetov's Ben-Hur is far shorter than Wyler’s epic, clocking in under two hours, but thanks to its bland lead actors — anchored by Jack Huston in the title role — and pedestrian dialogue, it still manages to drag on far too long. Ben-Hur’s action scenes are hectic and graceless digital-era creations, a blur of ugly pixels scattered haphazardly onto the screen. Even when Bekmambetov replicates the major set pieces from Wyler’s 1959 production, it just ends up reminding viewers how much better the originals were. The final chariot race borrows the same basic elements, but adds nothing except an occasional GoPro shot to suggest an on-the-ground perspective. The whole sequence suffers from overreliance on computer-generated imagery — which is good for the horses, which in Wyler’s version were cruelly forced to run over tripwires. But the thousands of extras and most of the racetrack set are now computer-generated too, giving the entire sequence a sense of weightless unreality. The new version bungles the story’s religious aspects as well. The 1880 Lew Wallace novel was subtitled A Tale of the Christ, and occurs in parallel to the biblical story of Jesus. Previous adaptations have always served as conversion stories pitched to the faithful. (The 1925 version was advertised as ""The Picture Every Christian Should See!"") Bekmambetov’s remake doesn’t completely excise the story’s religiosity (though it does skip the nativity scene that opened previous versions). But it certainly muddles the material, portraying Jesus as a kind of hot Mediterranean guru of peace and love. Played by a tanned and buff Rodrigo Santoro, he’s the sort of hunky, hippie male model type you can imagine on a romance novel cover, whose most profound idea is that ""love is our true nature."" The character of Jesus is barely an afterthought in this Ben-Hur, and Bekmambetov’s normally hyperactive direction grows tepid and dull every time he appears onscreen. As a director, Bekmambetov appears unfamiliar with the concept or experience of emotions, and can’t manage to drum up a modicum of sentimentality. He stages Jesus’s crucifixion with all the feeling of a laundry detergent commercial and none of the despair that comes from not being able to remove those blue stains. There are ways to update Ben-Hur for a modern audience: The sprawling story could be clipped and converted into a short and bloody B-movie, or reworked as an anguished period drama — perhaps with some of the homoerotic subtext brought to the fore in ways that wouldn’t have been allowed in 1959. It could be overhauled as a brooding critique of conversion stories, or it could stay true to form as an extravagant Christian epic about both violence and forgiveness. But Bekmambetov went none of these routes. He seems to have had no animating idea other than a movie with a clunky CGI chariot race, which might as well be called Ben-Hur. The result is a passion play without any passion, an epic without any scale, a remake that has no idea why it was made.",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/20/12547768/ben-hur-remake-fail,,Vox
399,399,04-11-17 00:45,2017,11,4,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,"Stranger Things season 2 review: bigger, weirder, and — eventually — better","At once better and worse than its first season, Stranger Things 2 is good enough to suggest the breakout Netflix series isn’t a one-trick pony, while still falling into many of the pitfalls that made season one diminish a bit in the memory the further one got from it. It takes a long time to get where it’s going, it makes some bafflingly strange choices on the way there, and it still feels like a show that’s set in “the ’80s!” instead of the 1980s. But when it works, it works. I’m powerless to resist it. You probably are too. In some ways, the series is trapped by elements entirely beyond its control. The first season became a phenomenon entirely by word of mouth and gentle nudging by the Netflix algorithm. Before you knew it, think pieces rained from the skies, catalogs to the show’s ’80s movie references popped up on every website in existence (including this one), and merchandise filled Hot Topics across our great nation. It’s the kind of overexposure that’s dangerous to any TV show, much less one as unassuming as Stranger Things — a good show, but not a perfect one. The hype machine quickly put a spotlight on its (mostly forgivable) flaws; I kept finding myself taking the opposite position of people in arguments about how it was great and how it was overrated. And yet somewhere in the intersection between its synth-heavy score, its pitch-perfect casting, and its “always October” aesthetic, the show’s biggest moments and best characters had a tendency to stick in the memory. It was deeply flawed but hard to shake, the kind of TV show you could love in spite of its worst moments, which was appropriate for a series about kids approaching adolescence. Season two is, in the grand tradition of sequels, even more than season one. Sometimes, that’s good. Sometimes, that’s very bad. But to tell you more about it, I’m going to have to spoil everything. (If you’re not quite ready for that, check out our spoiler-free rundown of what to expect.) Season one of Stranger Things had a reasonably involving opening, a solid climax, and then a bunch of other stuff in the middle. There were moments in that long midsection that worked beautifully — like Joyce (Winona Ryder) communicating with her missing son via Christmas lights — but so many other storylines seemed to exist solely to keep the plot from advancing too quickly. (I see you, Joyce’s ex-husband who just showed up to run out the clock.) Season two has much less of a problem with this. Since series creators the Duffer brothers know what an incredible ensemble cast they have (about which more in a bit), they feel more comfortable splitting up the characters and filling episodes with multiple storylines. The cross-cutting between the stories can sometimes feel a little arbitrary, but it’s still exciting when 15 different things are happening at once and all of them are bad. Even better, there’s more attention paid to the idea of each installment of the show as an episode of television than there was in season one. The season’s boldest conceit is its seventh episode, which seems to exist solely as a test of whether young Millie Bobby Brown, who plays the telekinetic badass Eleven, is as good of an actress as she seems to be. (Good news: She is!) It sends her off on a quest of her own, expanding the show’s backstory just a bit by introducing some of the previous kids with psychic powers experimented upon in the lab where Eleven grew up. And it doesn’t feature any of the other regulars at all. But more importantly, the Duffers know when to bring their many splintered storylines and characters back together. The season’s final two episodes are a long process of reweaving everything that’s been frayed, and when the season’s coda (which takes place during a Christmas season that seems to exist in the middle of summer) unfurls at a school dance, there’s a distinct sense of time having passed, lessons having been learned, and kids growing up. You can quibble with how this arc gets where it’s going — I’m about to! — but as a piece of television storytelling, as opposed to the fabled “eight-hour movie,” this is a much stronger feat than season one. The Eleven-centric hour may be structurally daring. It may be a great showcase for Brown. It may be proof that Stranger Things can do standalone episodes, despite its streaming origins. It’s just not very good. The story tells us nothing new about Eleven, and it has her decide to return to Hawkins, Indiana, to save her friends via a plot device that could have occurred literally anywhere on the globe. It’s intriguing to see her meet up with Eight (Linnea Berthelsen), her older predecessor, whose psychic power is making people see whatever she wants them to see, but the show doesn’t do anything with it except offer a riff on crime movies. I think the point is to show Eleven building confidence, or at least maturing into the kind of person who will make the selfless decision to go back to Hawkins, but the show doesn’t earn this story beat anywhere other than on its surface. This is the basic problem that plagues season two, especially its first half. It has all of the right ideas, but its execution often ends up shooting those ideas in the foot. Stranding Eleven from the rest of the cast (save her eventual adopted father, Chief Hopper, played by David Harbour) to let her take time to rebuild her psyche after all the trauma she’s faced is a great idea. But because the story can’t find much to do except have her argue with Hopper a bunch of times, it feels like it’s running in place, while the other characters could really use a superpowered telekinetic girl. Eleven’s major bit of character development — meeting her biological mother — is therefore delayed. It feels like she’s been sent to her own storyline not to develop her character, but because having her on the side of the other heroes wouldn’t make it a fair fight. A similar thing unfolds in the season’s single worst storyline, which follows Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Steve (Joe Keery) as they attempt to atone for the death of Nancy’s friend Barb, who became an internet cause célèbre based on how little the show seemed to care that she got lost in the parallel dimension known as the Upside Down. These scenes — ostensibly taking place a year later — feel like they’re responding to online criticism, not an organic character journey, and they always bog the show down. Thus, the show is better at macro plotting, but still not terribly great at micro plotting. It moves in fits and starts, able to suddenly, wondrously impress with a gigantic moment, and then frustrate when it cuts corners to get characters exactly where it needs them to be. One of the five Emmys Stranger Things won for its first season was for casting (for the team of Carmen Cuba, Tara Feldstein, and Chase Paris), and it was well-deserved. In addition to finding five kid actors who can nail every emotional beat, the show’s casting directors also found a bunch of actors to play teenagers (harder than it might seem), as well as an adult cast that blended well-known names (like Ryder) and familiar TV actors who, nonetheless, had never had a break like this (the aforementioned Harbour). If great TV casting often comes down to just finding actors viewers want to see together onscreen, the Stranger Things casting team is one of the best out there. Season two, then, is a dual exercise in finding new actors who will mesh with the old ones (including Sadie Sink as Max, another tween girl to join the central quartet of boys and thus balance things out a bit) as the writers explore just what they have in their original troupe. Every single character gets a moment or two to shine throughout the season — save maybe Cara Buono, sadly wasted as Karen Wheeler, mom to two important characters — and every actor delivers, in ways both big (some of the moments handed to Brown and Harbour) and small (a touching act of kindness from Dyer’s Nancy in the finale). The new actors fit perfectly as well, even when asked to play ridiculous beats like “buff teenage boy turning on frustrated housewife.” Even Sean Astin, who’s handed a character so moldy the writers actually name him “Bob Newby” to point out that you know he’s a walking trope, gets a few moments to surprise and subvert his role as “the guy who dies in the season’s last third.” (He dutifully does so in episode eight of nine.) And Paul Reiser isn’t just playing his corporate stooge from Aliens — he’s playing that guy if he had developed a conscience shortly after that movie’s events. But the really big moments are saved for the returning players — especially Harbour, Brown, and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers (who spent almost all of season one in the Upside Down). Second seasons are often so good because those involved in them now know exactly how to write to their actors’ strengths. The same seems to be true for Stranger Things. Truth be told, Stranger Things 2 blends in many of its movie references with more finesse than the series did in season one. A climactic attempt to drive the malicious “Shadow Monster” out of Will — who’s been infected with some sort of evil virus — lifts heavily from The Exorcist, for instance, but in a way where you’re not doing a mental shot-for-shot comparison to that classic film. Stranger Things gets to the same place but handles things in a different fashion. But the show remains stranded in the ’80s as interpreted through movies and TV shows; it doesn’t capture the ’80s so much as it captures how it felt to watch movies on VHS. This is most evident in its musical choices, which are slightly more adventurous than in season one but still run headlong toward the sorts of songs that play in time-travel movies to indicate the characters have arrived in the ’80s. (Devo’s “Whip It” receives particular abuse.) This might seem weird to say about a show containing monsters from parallel dimensions and telekinetic supergirls, but Stranger Things never feels as if it takes place in a reality that couldn’t be captured on a movie set. That grates, especially in the earlier, slower episodes. Once the plot kicks in, it’s easier to ignore how indebted the series is to its main trio of influences (Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King), but in the long setup period, the game of “spot the pop culture touchstone” feels enervating far more often than it does inspiring, simply because these pop culture touchstones aren’t particularly hard to spot. It’s like solving a Where’s Waldo puzzle that consists of Waldo standing in a field with a handful of other people scattered about, nowhere near him. On the other hand, that’s probably central to the show’s appeal. Its heightened blend of pop culture influences and pulp storytelling tropes reminds me, at times, of Lost, which managed its own blend of Spielberg, Carpenter, and King with more panache (and better disguised its influences beneath its own original ideas). And as with that show, I imagine some of Stranger Things’, “Hey, I recognize that bit!” factor is inherent to the series’ appeal — it’s how the show captures a feeling of nostalgia for a life none of us could possibly have lived. If there’s a place where Stranger Things 2 is likely to lose points in the eyes of its most diehard fans, it’s in the way the second season tries desperately to repeat many of the most memorable elements of season one. Will, once again, is almost lost to his loved ones. He once again communicates through an unlikely means (a series of crayon drawings, as opposed to season one’s Christmas lights). Once again, there’s a strange visitor from another world who becomes attached to a particular food item (instead of Eleven and Eggos, it’s a larval monster that loves Three Musketeers bars — and, yes, the series gets way out ahead of your, “Hey, isn’t that just E.T.?” thoughts). The character beats and moments in the season’s final episodes keep the show from feeling like it’s running around endless iterations of the same ideas. They remind us that, yes, this is a show full of engaging characters, that knows how to tell a compelling story, that can craft immensely exciting cinematic moments. But it’s also a show that seems worried about moving too far past season one, about leaving behind elements of the story it probably should ditch for fear that the audience might turn on it. That sort of transition often plagues shows that blew up in season one and enter their second seasons unsure of what made them blow up. (For another example, look over at NBC’s This Is Us.) It’s, of course, also true of movie sequels, especially the ones that drag elements from their predecessors into a new scenario wholesale. I always point to Home Alone 2, which had Kevin McCallister meet a new seemingly menacing old person whom he befriends later on, simply because he had done so in the first. Stranger Things hasn’t yet fallen into the Home Alone 2 trap. But it’s telling that the most exciting moments of season two are the ones when the characters evolve and change, and when the world around them does too. When the season ends with an epilogue promising that the battle against the shadow monster isn’t over, it’s not hard to wish the show could find some new beast to battle. We’ve been here. TV is all about going to the place that’s next. Stranger Things 2 is streaming on Netflix.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/27/16548566/stranger-things-season-2-review-spoilers,,Vox
400,400,19-06-18 00:00,2018,6,19,"A. Ananthalakshmi, Kevin Krolicki, Emily Chow",Exclusive - Malaysia seeks to lay multiple charges against ex-PM Najib over 1MDB: Mahathir,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Embezzlement and bribery with government money are among the charges that Malaysia is looking to bring against former prime minister Najib Razak following a probe into funds allegedly looted from the state-run fund 1MDB, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday.  Mahathir told Reuters in an interview that Malaysian investigators already “have an almost perfect case” against the principal suspects who had defrauded 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and misappropriated billions of dollars in public funds.  He also described Najib, who founded 1MDB in 2009, as playing a central role.  “He was totally responsible for 1MDB. Nothing can be done without his signature, and we have his signature on all the deals entered into by 1MDB. Therefore, he is responsible,” Mahathir said.  Having retired as prime minister in 2003 after 22 years in power, Mahathir - who is aged 92 - came out of retirement and joined the opposition to topple Najib in an election last month.   Following his stunning victory, Mahathir has reopened investigations into 1MDB and Najib’s involvement in its operations.   As a result of an anti-kleptocracy probe, the U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and that about $700 million of that ended up in Najib’s personal bank accounts.  Mahathir has barred Najib from leaving Malaysia, and police have searched properties linked to him, while anti-graft investigators have questioned both Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor.    Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He has said having the nearly $700 million transferred into his account had been a donation from an unnamed Saudi royal, an assertion Mahathir said the government was preparing to challenge in court.  Responding to Mahathir’s comments, Najib denied doing anything illegal, but added that even if he had given any illegal orders at 1MDB, the management and board of the fund would not have been bound to act on it.  “As far as I am concerned, I did not do anything that I thought was illegal (with regards to 1MDB),” Najib told Reuters.    Investigators are looking to bring “a number of charges” against Najib, Mahathir said, adding those charges would be based on abuse of power when he was prime minister.   They could include “embezzlement, stealing government money, losing government money and a number of other charges. Using government money to bribe. All those things,” he said.  Mahathir said Rosmah was also being investigated in connection with 1MDB.   “Some of the money is believed to have gone to her, lots of money,” Mahathir said. “We know about this, but finding the paper trail is a bit more difficult in this case because she doesn’t sign any papers. Najib signs a lot of papers.”  Mahathir said he expected Malaysia to make its first arrest in the 1MDB case within months and “hopefully” start a trial by the end of the year.  “We are working as hard as possible at a furious pace. We think that we already have almost a perfect case,” Mahathir said.   Asked to name the targets of that case, he said, “Against Najib, against Jho Low and a few others.”  Low is a Malaysian financier, who is also seen as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal. He is regarded as close to Najib and his family.   Low’s lawyer could not be immediately reached for comment.  “When we go to the courts, we will have clear evidence of the wrongdoing. We cannot afford to lose,” said Mahathir.  The prime minister said Low had contacted him to try to make a deal on 1MDB — seeking protection from prosecution in exchange for providing information, but Mahathir said he had turned down the offer. Asked if he would consider reaching any similar kind of arrangement with Najib, Mahathir said: “No deal. No deal.”  Mahathir’s promises to root out corruption and punish those responsible for the 1MDB fraud was central to his successful campaign to unseat Najib’s Barisan Nasional coalition that had ruled Malaysia for over 60 years until last month.  Malaysian investigations into 1MDB were essentially shut down during Najib’s premiership after the then-attorney general - who was sacked by Mahathir in his first few days in office - cleared him of any wrongdoing even as at least five other countries continued their own investigations.   U.S. investigators had regarded Najib’s government as obstructive, sources have said. Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber said last year that Malaysian authorities had refused to cooperate.  Mahathir on Tuesday said he was confident of recovering “quite a lot” of the lost 1MDB money, adding Malaysia will look into why Goldman Sachs was paid almost $600 million for helping 1MDB issue debt, an amount that critics say exceeded a normal level for fees.  Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters last week that Malaysia was looking at whether there were grounds for claims against Goldman Sachs and other banks that profited from 1MDB.  Mahathir, who turns 93 next month, is the world’s oldest prime minister. Aides, political allies and Mahathir himself say he has been working long hours in his first six weeks, belying his age.  His stint as premier this time around is harder, said Mahathir, in part because of the challenge of rebuilding and restaffing key ministries.  “Before when I was prime minister, the structure of machinery was intact. This time around, I had to form a new government with people who have no experience. And then I find that all the ministries, all the departments have become corrupted.”  Asked if he believed there had been other abuses beyond 1MDB, he said: “We don’t know for sure, but we have felt that a lot of government money was abused, made use of by the government for non-government purposes.”  Mahathir said he also understood he could not make a clean sweep of suspected corruption and keep the government running, as it was hard to find “reliable people” to fill posts.  “We can’t sack everybody,” he said.

401,401,09-06-19 00:00,2019,6,9,Ernest Scheyder,How much does lithium cost? The industry can't seem to agree,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Opaque pricing for lithium, the powerhouse metal fueling the electric vehicle revolution, is expected to be top of mind this week as the industry’s leaders gather in Santiago, with calls rising for more transparency to attract much-needed expansion funding.  Unlike for copper or other metals used to make electric cars, there is no traded price for lithium. The London Metal Exchange is working to develop a tradable price for the white metal, but until then, the industry’s investors, customers, analysts and executives are left without a full sense of the global market.  “The fact that there isn’t a benchmark price means that some of the banks haven’t been keen to get involved because they can’t hedge their price risk,” said William Adams, an analyst at Fastmarkets, which is hosting the Santiago conference and vying to be a pricing provider for the LME contract.  For now, the industry grabs on to whatever scuttlebutt it can find, with data swirling on prices for spodumene, a hard rock containing lithium; prices for hydroxide or carbonate, the two main types of lithium used in batteries; or prices paid by battery manufacturers across China, Japan and South Korea.  “You’re almost forced to just take the average of the price estimates that are out there,” said James Calaway, chairman of ioneer Ltd, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada.  While spot prices in China have dropped double digits since January due to uncertainty around the country’s electric vehicle subsidies, such prices reflect only a portion of global demand.   Some companies, including global leader Albemarle Corp, sell nearly all of their lithium on long-term contracts and are not influenced by Chinese spot prices, a distinction many on Wall Street do not seem to make.   Albemarle’s stock is down 12 percent since January.  “The China spot price is what the market is watching and until it picks up in a meaningful way, the sentiment will be negative,” said Howard Klein, a lithium analyst and partner with New York-based advisory firm RK Equity. “But the demand is there.”  SQM, which eschews long-term contracts, said its first-quarter lithium prices slipped 11 percent, leading it to pause expansion plans in Chile’s Atacama desert.  Livent Corp, which operates in Argentina, cut its 2019 forecast and warned that demand was slipping for a version of lithium it produces in China, and would sell product elsewhere.  Since January, SQM’s shares are down 19 percent and Livent’s shares have lost 53 percent.   “Investors are valuing the industry based on the worst they’re hearing from only a handful of companies, because they don’t have a benchmark price to base analysis around,” said Ernie Ortiz, president of Lithium Royalty Corp, an affiliate of Waratah Capital Advisors, which buys lithium royalty rights.  Many long-term supply contracts are already referencing an LME price, an anticipatory step designed to set future deal parameters, Ortiz said.  “The LME is continuing to pursue the launch of a lithium contract, in close partnership with industry users,” said LME spokeswoman Bianca Blake. In addition to Fastmarkets, Argus and Benchmark Minerals are vying to supply lithium pricing data, and a decision is expected “shortly,” Blake said.  Even with the price uncertainty, though, demand is spiking. Toyota Motor Corp, for example, plans to have half of its global sales come from electric vehicles by 2025.  The lithium industry’s largest players are inking fresh expansion deals as a result. Albemarle last fall signed a $1.15 billion joint venture agreement with Mineral Resource Ltd to own and operate the Wodgina lithium mine in Western Australia, a deal that expands Albemarle’s prowess with Asian customers.   Ganfeng Lithium Co, which already has several Australian ventures, spent $160 million to boost its stake in an Argentina lithium project with Lithium Americas Corp.    Tianqi Lithium Corp, in the world’s largest lithium deal ever, paid $4.1 billion last year for a near-quarter stake in SQM, part of a push by Chinese companies for more lithium access.  But smaller and mid-tier players are finding it difficult to procure funding as potential financiers balk without a tradable lithium price, which would let them hedge their investment.  Neo Lithium Corp, ioneer, Standard Lithium Ltd, Sigma Lithium Resources Corp and other prospective lithium projects have all struggled to attract investors largely due to that price uncertainty.  “Greater transparency is severely needed,” said Jake Fraser, a metals analyst with Roskill.  A traded lithium price would make conversations with potential customers or financiers much easier, said Carlos Vicens, finance chief at Neo Lithium, which is developing an Argentine lithium deposit.  “Our main focus is to get a financier, a strategic partner, to get this project into construction as soon as possible,” Vicens said.

402,402,03-05-19 00:00,2019,5,3,Jasmine Weber,The Tantalizing Photographic Figure at 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair,"At the fair, you can trace visual conversations happening across regions of Africa and their diasporic communities. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads 1–54 Contemporary African Art Fair, held this year at Industria in the West Village, gathers together an impressive bevy of thoughtful work from and about the African diaspora. With over 70 artists showcased, the 24 participating galleries hail from Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Martinique, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Belgium, France, Portugal, Turkey, the UK, and the US. Walking through the diverse displays, you can trace clear conversations happening across regions of Africa and their diasporic communities. Certain themes repeat themselves — particularly religion, sexuality, beauty, and family — and there is an evident interest in texture and pattern. This year’s edition, curated by Black Chalk & Co. (an art collective founded by Zimbabwean artists Nontsikelelo Mutiti and Tinashe Mushakavanhu) is named Why Don’t You Carve Other Animals, a direct reference to a short story on colonialism in 1970s Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) by Yvonne Vera. The fair pamphlet reads: “Vera recognized the potential of the literary text to function as an important means of appropriating, inverting, and challenging dominant means of representation and colonial ideologies.” This year’s fair takes this challenge to task with visual artworks, in order to “understand and make visible black realities and imaginaries.” New York’s Danziger Gallery put together an impressive photographic display, most prominently featuring Malian legend Seydou Keïta, who is often cited alongside Malick Sidibé as one of the major photographic influences in Mali during the 20th century. Though their creative studio portraits are often conflated, the two have distinct styles — Keïta’s career began much earlier and lean towards editorial. However, their similar styles of photography have defined West African portraiture for generations, and continue to have an influence on the photographers of the African diaspora. The Keïta images on display make clear a number of intriguing beauty trends of the times — most notably, all of the women, girls, and even some infants had sharp, thin, elongated eyebrows drawn on in black. Across the Atlantic Ocean in the United Kingdom, Black beauty pageants revealed other trends. Raphael Albert’s images of “Miss Black and Beautiful” pageants in the UK in the 1970s showcase updated beauty trends for Black women — some bore relaxers, and others rocked afros. Danzinger’s all-photographic display paired Keïta with images by the Grenadan artist, as well as Nigerian photographer JD ‘Okhai Ojeikere, whose images show different hair trends, showcasing the malleability and potential for Black hair as art. At Yossi Milo, I was introduced to the jaw-dropping, laborious work of Kyle Meyer. Meyer’s massive creations take portraits of Black men donning wax-cloth headwraps traditionally worn by women, and weaves these images with strips of the same fabric. The artworks are hard to discern but glorious to look at; they are simultaneously tapestry, sculpture, photograph, and collage, and the sitters gaze at you with an earnest presence. Also on display by Yossi Milo were the visually enticing, bright works of Hassan Hajjaj, a Moroccan portraitist who hybridizes photography and sculpture to bring together pop culture, consumerism, and North African culture. Sanlé Sory’s studio portraits of Burkina Faso add to the fair’s wide presence of West African studio photography from the 20th century. Johannesburg gallery Afronova had an intriguing selection of images. Lebohang Kganye, a 29-year-old South African artist, recreated endearing images of her mother’s youth. John Liebenberg’s photos of Black South African individuals in the 1980s, while the nation was still embroiled in its decades-long apartheid, display a clear reference to the studio genre. Parisian gallery MAGNIN-A brought together a trifecta of vintage prints by Malick Sidibé, Seydou Keïta, and J. D.’Okhai Ojeikere. While Sidibé’s images point toward the groovy male fashion trends happening in 1960s-7os Mali, Ojeikere again captured the sculptural beauty of West African women’s hairstyles. MAGNIN-A also introduced me to Fabrice Monteiro, whose modern studio photographs subvert images of subordination by making them regal, and are titled for offensive stereotypes and slurs like “Mr. Banania” and “Little Ninny.” The Belgian-Beninese artist takes on an unusual fantasy — the visual cues of distinct lips (which are white, rather than red, in the black-and-white images), circus gear, and cotton plants — and asks how and why these offensive symbols got their power. In short, I was dazzled by the photographic figure at 1-54. And despite my proclivity toward the photography, there is also a rich selection of painting, sculpture, and other unique object art. Stunning paintings by Richard Mudariki are presented by Barnard Gallery (Cape Town, South Africa); DeBuck Gallery (New York, NY) is displaying one of Devan Shimoyama’s textured portraits, which are simultaneously a celebration and an ode to the silencing of queer culture in Black communities; and Jean-Ulrick Désert’s “Waters of Kiskeya” is a pearlescent map of colonialism, shown by 14N61W (Martinique). The fair as a whole feels like a modern retrospective on contemporary African art, with something for everyone. 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair continues at Industria (775 Washington St, New York, NY) through May 5.

406,406,18-06-19 00:00,2019,6,18,"Jonathan Barrett, Paulina Duran",Betting the house: investors demand higher premiums for risky Australian mortgage bonds,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Investors in Australian mortgage bonds are demanding higher premiums to buy the riskiest tranches of new debt, as a slowing economy stokes concerns a property downturn could get worse and increase home loan defaults.   High-yield investors are receiving up to 40 basis points more than they were last year to buy the lower-rated and unrated portions, according to an analysis of recent deals by large lenders including AMP, National Australia Bank and Members Equity Bank.  That marks an important shift from a near decade-long run of relatively stable spreads for the lower-rated residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), as the previously red-hot property prices have turned sharply lower, particularly in the major Sydney and Melbourne markets.  “When you are looking at those lower unrated tranches, they are deteriorating as one would expect at the late stage of the [property] cycle,” said George Boubouras, chief investment officer at Atlas Capital.  “We see them as a leading indicator of risk, and they have been getting riskier.”  Home prices in Australia’s heavily populated eastern states have fallen rapidly since late-2017 due to souring economic conditions, pushing problem home loans to their highest level since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, according to Standard & Poor’s.   Jonathan Kearns, head of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Financial Stability Department, said on Tuesday that arrears on housing loans are likely to keep rising for a while longer, but should not pose a risk to financial stability as long as unemployment remains low.  Indeed, the still-strong appetite for the safer - and much bigger - portions of mortgage debt suggests a major economic shock is unlikely.  The sector has also enjoyed a string of favorable policy moves in recent weeks including an interest rate cut for borrowers, proposed easing of lending rules and the surprise re-election of a conservative government which opposes higher property taxes.  All the same, as economic growth slumped to a decade low last quarter, an unusually long period of slow wages growth has also throttled household incomes and put pressure on borrowers trying to meet mortgage repayments.  The household debt to income ratio is at a record high 190%, according to RBA data.  Investors at the riskier-end of mortgage bond deals, which include higher interest payments, would take the first hit should loans start to default, though an investment grade RMBS tranche in Australia has never been hit by losses.  AMP last week sold A$1.6 million in un-rated bonds backed by mortgages, with the pricing of 6.2% representing 40 basis points more than the spread offered to buyers of similar risky bonds last year.   An ME Bank deal this month included A$5.25 million of unrated securities paying a 6% margin over benchmark rates which is 25 basis points more than what ME Bank paid buyers of similar non-rated bonds in October, the bank said.  The premium is in line with the pricing of several other RMBS deals, including one issued by NAB late last year.  Australian-issued RMBS volumes were tracking at $9.1 billion between January and June 5 this year, according to Refinitiv data, led by a global thirst for yield, but at a slower pace than the $26 billion for all of 2017.   David Bailey, chief executive of mortgage broker and RMBS-issuer Australian Finance Group, said demand for the products remained very strong despite some change to the returns in the lower tranches.  “As there’s been more and more discussion around a potential housing bubble and so forth, investors would in the back of the mind be saying, ‘maybe I do need to charge a little more for the risk’.”  Property analyst Martin North, of Digital Finance Analytics, said deals structured at the height of the property boom around 2017 and prior to prudential regulator-imposed changes to lending standards in 2014 were among the most susceptible.  “The debt bomb is still ticking, and even if a crash is delayed, the debt burden has to be dealt with at some time,” said North.    Reporting by Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran in SYDNEY; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-property-debt/betting-the-house-investors-demand-higher-premiums-for-risky-australian-mortgage-bonds-idUSL4N22Y0OL,Business News,Reuters

The social network is at fault for failing to remove posts from Palestinians that spark such attacks, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s minister of Public Security, told Israeli TV station Channel 2 on Saturday. “The victims’ blood is partially on Facebook’s hands,” he said, via Bloomberg. “Facebook has turned into a monster. The younger generation in the Palestinian Authority runs its entire discourse of incitement and lies and finally goes out to commit murderous acts on Facebook’s platform.” (The interview is in Hebrew, but Recode has confirmed the quote’s accuracy.) Facebook is often criticized for the ways it polices speech, which often puts it in conflict with national governments. The current Israeli government, for example, frequently faces criticism for attempts to curb speech, online and offline, particularly in the Palestinian territories. Israeli officials have recently claimed that social media has fanned the flames of a spate of “lone wolf” attacks that began last fall. The latest one, which spurred Erdan’s comments, involved the fatal stabbing of a 13-year-old Israeli in the West Bank region. Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment. But in a statement to Bloomberg, a Facebook rep said the company works “regularly with safety organizations and policy makers around the world, including Israel, to ensure that people know how to make ... safe use of Facebook. There is no room for content that promotes violence, direct threats, terrorist or hate speeches on our platform.” Additional reporting by Noah Kulwin.

GIF search is powered by Giphy and Riffsy, and will roll out over the next few weeks to all users on Android, iOS, and the web.  On the surface this may seem like just a simple feature that Twitter is merely adding for the fun of it, but it actually speaks to a larger trend: augmenting text communication with visual cues like GIFs and emoji. It was only last year that several dedicated GIF creation apps were released for smartphones, letting users, say, turn videos of their adorable pets into social media-ready GIFs. And more recently, news website Quartz's new iPhone app (which has earned rave reviews) makes extensive use of emoji in its user interface to maximize screen real estate. Heck, Quartz in June 2015 even released a dedicated emoji keyboard for the iPhone.  Of course, making Twitter more appealing to everyday people—who doesn't like GIFs?—and not just power users is the underlying thread of Jack Dorsey's second stint as CEO, as exemplified by features like Moments (which curates interesting tweets so people don't have to hunt them down on their own) and the algorithmic timeline (which places interesting tweets at the top of users' timelines).  Now here's one of my favorite GIFs to mark the occasion:  via GIPHY",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xygdv7/twitter-adds-gif-search,Tech by VICE,Vice

At least 22 people were injured when the bus skidded off a winding road in Kisthwar district, government official Angrez Singh Rana said.  Media reports said the bus was overloaded. Accidents are common in the mountainous region where many roads are in disrepair.  Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Mailk said many of the drivers were untrained and he had ordered state officials to cancel their licenses.   “Most of the accidents take place due to careless and untrained drivers who drive without any regard for rules and regulations,” a state government spokesman quoted the governor as saying.   Last week, 11 students were killed when their bus fell into a deep gorge at a picnic spot in Shopian district.

410,410,06-05-18 00:00,2018,5,6,"Marianna Parraga, Deisy Buitrago",Exclusive: Conoco moves to take over Venezuelan PDVSA's Caribbean assets - sources,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to three sources familiar with its actions.  The U.S. firm targeted facilities on the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of Venezuela’s oil exports last year. The three play key roles in processing, storing and blending PDVSA’s oil for export.   The company received court attachments freezing assets at least two of the facilities, and could move to sell them, one of the sources said.   Conoco’s legal maneuvers could further impair PDVSA’s declining oil revenue and the country’s convulsing economy. Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil exports, which have fallen by a third since its peak and its refineries ran at just 31 percent of capacity in the first quarter.   The Latin American country is in the grip of a deep recession with severe shortages of medicine and food as well as a growing exodus of its people.   PDVSA and the Venezuelan foreign ministry did not respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Dutch authorities said they are assessing the situation on Bonaire.        Conoco’s claims against Venezuela and state-run PDVSA in international courts have totaled $33 billion, the largest by any company.   “Any potential impacts on communities are the result of PDVSA’s illegal expropriation of our assets and its decision to ignore the judgment of the ICC tribunal,” Conoco said in an email to Reuters.      The U.S firm added it will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions.  PDVSA has significant assets in the Caribbean. On Bonaire, it owns the 10-million-barrel BOPEC terminal which handles logistics and fuel shipments to customers, particularly in Asia. In Aruba, PDVSA and its unit Citgo lease a refinery and a storage terminal.   On the island of St. Eustatius, it rents storage tanks at the Statia terminal, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where over 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude were retained by court order, according to one of the sources.   NuStar is aware of the order and “assessing our legal and commercial options,” said spokesman Chris Cho. The company does not expect the matter to change its earnings outlook, he said.   Conoco also sought to attach PDVSA inventories on Curacao, home of the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery and Bullenbay oil terminal. But the order could not immediately be enforced, according to two of the sources.  Last year, PDVSA’s shipments from Bonaire and St Eustatius terminals accounted for about 10 percent of its total exports, according to internal figures from the state-run company. The exports were mostly crude and fuel oil for Asian customers including ChinaOil, China’s Zhenhua Oil and India’s Reliance Industries.  From its largest Caribbean operations in Curacao, PDVSA shipped 14 percent of its exports last year, including products exported by its Isla refinery to Caribbean islands and crude from its Bullenbay terminal to buyers of Venezuelan crude all over the world.   PDVSA on Friday ordered its oil tankers sailing across the Caribbean to return to Venezuelan waters and await further instructions, according to a document viewed by Reuters. In the last year, several cargoes of Venezuelan crude have been retained or seized in recent years over unpaid freight fees and related debts.  “This is terrible (for PDVSA),” said a source familiar with the court order of attachment. The state-run company “cannot comply with all the committed volume for exports” and the Conoco action imperils its ability to ship fuel oil to China or access inventories to be exported from Bonaire.        At the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil producing joint ventures, which were nationalized in 2007 under late Venezuela President Hugo Chavez. The U.S. firm left the country after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA.   A separate arbitration case involving the loss of its Venezuelan assets is before a World Bank tribunal, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.  Exxon Mobil Corp also has brought two separate arbitration claims over the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela.

This is real food: the kind left out for hours on platters, or packaged and lingering for days on the dark shelves of supermarkets, or swathed tightly in plastic wrap. You probably won’t find photographs of these dishes on Instagram (#eeeeats) either, but they’re celebrated in Martin Parr’s new book, simply titled Real Food.  Published by Phaidon, the over-200-page book — with a soft cover resembling a plastic red-and-white imitation gingham tablecloth in both appearance and touch — chronicles the Magnum photographer’s international food surveys from 1994 to 2015. Within its pages, Parr lays bare our varied culinary lifestyles, highlighting quotidian views that can be oddly otherworldly or simply amusing: cherry blossoms poke out between the crevices of a mountain of canned Spam in Tokyo, while flat bread tans on the trunk of a car in Cairo. From Uruguay’s Punta del Este comes a veritable sculpture of assorted blood-pressure raisers jostling for real estate on one plate; from Finland’s Nousiainen, a presentation of clearly can-sourced veggies and the most nondescript boiled potatoes. Rather than being organized by geography, though, the images are grouped loosely by subject: you’ll flip through sections of desserts (a stoner’s delight!) that leave you practically feeling the whipped cream from sundaes, cakes, and that plump slice of lemon meringue pie worm its way to your thighs. A series of food in transit to happy mouths — oozing oil, dripping with sauces — will leave you craving either a trip to a state fair or a salad. The photographs aren’t accompanied by captions (an index at the back details their source cities), but each photo still presents a strong sense of place, suggested by, for instance, tacky tablecloths, or less subtly, a red, white, and blue cake elegantly iced with “God Bless America.” In many images of shops and markets, the packaging of foods wrapped, canned, and tinned also offers some hint of where you are: Japanese text is emblazoned on plastic while handwritten labels spell out words in French. More than taking a gastronomic trip around the world, browsing Real Food is like watching a ballet of gluttony, each photograph of fattening, processed, or simply sad food elegantly choreographed into a sequence that has its share of nauseating moments but, in the end, satisfies. Real Food is published by Phaidon and available from Amazon and other online booksellers.",https://hyperallergic.com/292246/martin-parr-photographs-real-sad-food/,,Hyperallergic

If you’re a developer who works with Twitter, or if you like to keep tabs on a calendar, you’ve likely already figured this out. Flight took place in San Francisco the past two Octobers, and the company hasn’t made a peep about this year’s event. It turns out that’s because this year’s event is not happening. Sources say that the conference was planned, at least tentatively, but then abandoned. Company spokesperson Will Stickney confirmed Flight isn’t happening, and said Twitter plans to focus on smaller developer events instead. Here’s a statement: We heard feedback after last year's Flight conference that small, more intimate events are where our developer community are seeing the most value. So instead of holding a single developer conference in San Francisco, we are hosting a series of regional developer events, continuing the momentum from our global #HelloWorld. Given the diversity of things developers are building with Twitter (from MoPub, to the Ads API, to Gnip, Fabric, and more) having more local events will enable us to engage with our community in a much more personal way. Canceling Flight — or rather, never scheduling it — is notable given how important these kinds of developers conferences are to other big tech companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. They are usually as much a show for the media and investors as they are for developers, an excuse to show off tools and features the company is building. Apple announced a new watch at its developer conference this fall. Facebook launched a messaging bot platform at its event in April, and Google used its conference to talk about its virtual reality plans. Flight has been a stage for Twitter in the past, too, though on a smaller scale. Two years ago Twitter used Flight to announce its full developer suite, Fabric. Last year, CEO Jack Dorsey used the event to apologize to developers for a relationship he described as “a little bit complicated.” “We want to reset our relationship, and we want to make sure that we are learning, we are listening and we are rebooting,” he said at the time. Now Flight is done. And with Twitter’s future as a standalone company very much up in the air, we don’t yet know if it’ll be coming back.

413,413,06-11-18 15:30,2018,11,6,Alex Ward,"Midterm elections 2018: Russia trying to influence vote, US says","Here’s the good news: Just hours before millions vote in the 2018 midterms, top US security officials said they see no evidence a foreign government compromised the election. But now here’s the bad news: Those same officials say Russia and other countries aim to “influence” the election, in part by spreading misinformation. In other words, your actual ballot is safe, but other countries may still try to influence how you vote. The Monday night statement by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director Christopher Wray was clearly meant to calm any nerves ahead of the election. But it’s unsettling to hear that adversaries are still trying to shift public opinion, mostly via online methods. During the 2016 presidential election, for example, Russia used fake Facebook ads, Twitter bots, and other means to sow discord among the public and spread false information. It seems Moscow is at it again, and that China and Iran are also running influence campaigns. “They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics,” the statement by leading US security officials reads. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in September that would allow the US to automatically sanction any foreigner caught trying to interfere in the election, but that doesn’t seem to have slowed down the pace of meddling attempts. The Boston Globe reported on Monday that the federal government has logged more than 160 instances of suspected interference since August 1 and has jumped to about 10 instances a day in the few weeks before the midterms. They targeted voter registries, election officials, and other networks used to run the midterms. The attackers had some “limited success,” according to intelligence reports reviewed by the Globe, but it’s unclear exactly what that means. Most of the incidents were “foreign-based,” according to official reports. There are also other apparent meddling efforts. On Monday night, Facebook blocked 115 accounts — including 85 on Instagram — that US law enforcement said might be connected to foreign organizations that want to meddle in the election. Most of the Facebook pages were in French and Russian, but the Instagram posts were mainly in English. Facebook has also had to delete fake accounts tied to Iran in the months before the midterm elections. The officials offered three main ways to minimize the risk of influence by foreign governments. But again, the important thing to keep in mind is that a foreign country won’t alter your vote after it has been cast, according to the Trump administration. Not even Russia can do that — at least not yet.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18067756/midterm-election-russia-hacking-interference-meddling-china-iran,,Vox
414,414,18-08-16 18:28,2016,8,18,Michelle Lhooq,Ballroom Is America's Most Slept-On Subculture—MikeQ Wants to Open Our Eyes.,"MikeQ is weaving down Central Avenue in a pale gold SUV, trying to catch rare Pokemon on Pokemon Go. As we drive into East Orange, New Jersey—cruising past chain stores and a park that's deserted despite the mid-July heat—he aims his phone at a brick building on our right. ""That's my elementary school,"" he notes. ""And right next to it is a Pokestop."" When he picked me up from the Newark Path Train station moments before, I noticed that the car's license plate read CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. Dressed in a grey T-shirt, denim shorts, and black Puma sliders, he apologized to me as soon as I hopped in. ""Sorry, the air-conditioning is broken,"" he said. ""It's my grandmother's car."" MikeQ, born Michael Cox, is the soft-spoken ambassador of America's flashiest subculture, ballroom. There is no party in the world—no velvet-roped VIP club, no grime-covered warehouse—that can compare to a ball. On any given evening, if you know where to look, you'll see drag queens, butch queens, trans women, and other queer people of color flocking to clubs or rental venues, decked out in everything from head-to-toe Ferragamo, to an LED-lit corset, to trash bags stitched into a gown. The night unfolds as a series of battles for cash prizes and glory, some dancers twisting their bodies into spine-snapping drops to the floor, others swanning around like Naomi Campbell on a Parisian runway. Even though ballroom dates back to the 60s, the scene has largely flown under the radar—not only of mainstream America, but of the gay community itself. ""Stop 20 gay men, and ask them about the icons in the ballroom scene,"" ballroom veteran Power Infiniti lamented to the  Miami New Times in 2014. ""Most of them wouldn't even know."" In recent years, however, this oversight is being slowly rectified thanks to prominent advocates like MikeQ, a 30-year-old DJ and producer who has dedicated his decade-long career to championing ballroom's allure—and its commercial viability. He's toured cities where local ballroom scenes are sprouting up, like Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, Mexico, and Seoul. He's invaded living rooms across the globe with his live-streamed Boiler Room sets, and seduced the heads by linking up with the Fade to Mind label and GHE20G0TH1K party—both bulwarks of the experimental avant-garde. Even Missy Elliott slid into his DMs once, hitting up Mike in 2013 to collaborate on a ballroom track. In some ways, my visit to Mike's suburban hometown couldn't have come at a more inconvenient time. He's just flown home from a gig in LA. Later this week, he'll DJ at a party called Vogue Knights and attend the Latex Ball, an annual ballroom extravaganza co-founded by the Gay Men's Health Crisis nonprofit at the height of the 80s AIDS epidemic to spread awareness of HIV prevention in the scene. He's also preparing for the August 12 release of his label Qween Beat's first album, an 11-track compilation of ballroom-affiliated artists that Mike thinks deserve more shine. On top of everything, he's in the middle of moving out of the home where he's lived with his family since 1990, and into his longtime boyfriend's apartment a few blocks down the street. The house where Mike grew up is three stories tall, with curved white walls and windows with navy blue trim. A beaten-up box of toys lies on the spacious front porch, and more boxes line the entrance hallway. Two calendars of the Obama family—for the same year—are pinned to the bright yellow wall by the door. Stepping over a hamburger recipe book, I follow Mike up the creaky wooden stairs and come face-to-face with his 83-year-old grandmother, who is perched in a chair on the second-floor landing. Smiling sweetly, she grasps my hand with a trembling grip, mumbling a greeting I can't quite catch. Mike tells me his mother and grandfather used to live here but moved out a few years ago, leaving him and his grandmother to support his aunt and her two young kids, who also reside with them. ""That's why I hadn't moved out sooner—I wanted to be here helping with this house,"" he says. Up on the top floor, Mike's room is nearly empty save for his bed, his studio gear, and mountains of Nike boxes. Taking a seat at his desk next to two large computer screens, he swivels his black office chair to gaze around the room. ""I get sad on and off about it,"" he says. ""Sometime next week, I'll probably never be able to come in here. But it's time for change."" Mike was born in Hackensack, New Jersey and moved to the house here in East Orange when he was four. His dad lives fifteen minutes away, in Paterson—""the same town where Fetty Wap is from,"" Mike notes—and they would hang out on the weekends when he was growing up. Mike says he's been the ""quiet, geeky nerdy type"" since childhood, and sang in the choir in elementary school. ""I didn't dress nice,"" he says about his adolescence. ""I never had a haircut. I wasn't loud and out-and-about."" But he also had a rebellious streak. On the first day of middle school, he erased the name of the school his mother had written on his enrollment form because the building was ""so dingy and ghetto,"" replacing it with one he liked better. Somehow, he never got into trouble. In high school, Mike started smoking weed and skipping class, which got him held back a year. Still, he excelled at his job as a manager at Domino's Pizza. ""Work was more important to me,"" Mike says, ""It wasn't that I was stupid—I just got over school in a way."" Mike's life changed when he first walked into The Globe, a no-frills club that was the throbbing heart of Newark's gay scene in early to mid-2000s. ""I was scared to go there—I have always been who I am but never in a public space,"" he says, hinting at how suburban New Jersey isn't the most friendly environment for black gay kids like him. But one Friday night when he was 17 years old, Mike mustered his courage and hit the club with a friend. Walking onto the The Globe's black-and-white checkered floor, Mike recognized the familiar staccato chants and taut bass wallops of Jersey club, a hip-hop-influenced genre from Newark that Mike had often heard at local block parties and family barbeques growing up. But at the end of the night, the DJ started playing a he'd never heard before, full of cut-up vocal samples peppered over thunderous crash cymbals and tribal drumming. ""All these drag queens came out and started doing this dance,"" Mike recalls. ""[I thought] why the fuck are they throwing themselves on the ground like this? It was so weird, but it looked hot."" Mike had discovered the hyper-kinetic sounds of modern ballroom music—the fuel that gives dancers the adrenaline they need to dominate their opponents during battles. Back in the 80s, balls were soundtracked by elegant disco and hard house classics like MFSB's ""Love is the Message"" and Junior Vasquez's ""X."" In 1991, Masters At Work's classic ""The Ha Dance"" changed the game by giving ballroom its two signature sounds: an ecstatic ""ha!"" chant and metallic crashes on every fourth beat, often used by dancers as cues to dip to the floor. In 2000, tiring of the scene's limited playlist, modern ballroom pioneer Vjuan Allure sampled that ""ha"" in a remix specifically tailored to battles called ""The Allure Ha."" Vjuan's new of ballroom dispelled with traditional verse-verse-break song structure, ratcheting up the drama instead. ""When you play it, there's a feeling that you're ready to go out and battle,"" he told RBMA in 2012. The intense ballroom that Vjuan pioneered has ventured into even darker and more aggressive territory with younger producers like LSDXOXO, Quest?ionmarc, and Byrell the Great, while the internet has spawned thousands of bootleg ballroom remixes of popular songs. Mike fell in love with ballroom instantly. Unlike the music he grew up with, ballroom was inherently queer, its stuttering beats often punctuated by a vocalist hooting lines like ""Yas, bish, yaaas!"" and ""Work that pussy!"" ""Ballroom was danceable like Jersey club or house, but it was just gay,"" Mike explains. After that fateful night, Mike started driving into the city to hang out in the Village in Manhattan, a historic gay enclave. ""I was super amazed at all these gay people like me walking around,"" he says. ""Slowly I just came out."" Mike is open about his sexuality with his mother's side of the family, but things with his father are a bit more complicated. ""I know that he knows,"" Mike says matter-of-factly. ""We just never had that conversation."" Same goes for the wider community of people he grew up with in Jersey. ""I won't say super gay things on Facebook because all my friends from school are on there,"" he says. Teenage Mike fed his growing appetite for ballroom with CDs he bought from Vjuan Allure, Angel X, and Tony Cortes, all pioneering DJs he hung out with at The Club House. After studying their music at home, Mike started making his own tracks using Fruity Loops and ACID Pro, music production programs he got from a friend he met at The Globe. ""I would chop tracks and combine my sense of Jersey club with [ballroom],"" he explains. Mike tagged all his early productions with a special ""drop""—a recording of Vjuan Allure saying Mike's name that the older DJ had given him at his 19th birthday party. To Mike, the gift was a coveted stamp of approval. While Vjuan Allure and Angel X promoted their music the old-school way—selling CDs in-person to their fans at balls—Mike got his name out by posting his tracks to online ballroom forums like Walk 4 Me Wednesdays and DL Thugs. In fact, MikeQ's DJ moniker stems from his old username on those forums: MikeQ7000. ""I liked Infinity cars, and they were were always naming cars 'Infinity Q' and a number,"" he explains. ""Once I became a DJ, I just took the 7000 off."" In September 2005, Mike got an offer to DJ at The Globe. It was his first gig, and paid $70 for a six-hour slot. Afraid of messing up, he played a pre-mixed set off CDs he'd made at home. Soon, he was DJing all the time at both The Globe and The Club House. ""I became the resident at the first two clubs I ever went to, which was weird,"" he says. ""I just did that for years."" It's not difficult to see why: standing behind the booth, Mike has a special talent for zero-ing in on the dancefloor smashers you want to hear in a sweaty room full of your friends at 2 AM. When it comes to his own productions, Mike's ear for catchy hooks and propulsive baselines translates to his own idiosyncratic take on ballroom, one that involves cross-breeding that genre's musical DNA with hip-hop, pop, and industrial club. ""The Ha Dub ReWork'D,"" the lead track off his first EP for Fade to Mind in 2011, Let It All Out, pays homage to the Masters at Work ""ha"" sample, but forgoes the fuzzy house music crunch of the original, instead emphasizing its alien, ear-splitting synth triplets. It sounds like ""The Ha Dance"" transported from the Paradise Garage into an alien spaceship, 200 years in the future. Though his days at The Globe and The Club House are over, the one party that has remained a fixture in Mike's life is Vogue Knights, where he has been a resident DJ since it started six years ago. Founded by scene stalwarts Jack Mizrahi and Luna Kahn, Vogue Knights serves as as a relaxed space for dancers to practice their moves before joining more competitive balls. Over the years, it has drawn celebrities like FKA Twigs, Robert Pattinson, Queen Latifah, and Boys Noize as spectators; Twigs has even gone on to incorporate vogue dancing into her live shows. The scene has also produced its own breakout stars, like Hood By Air designer and GHE20G0THIK co-founder Shayne Oliver, model Shaun Ross, and Missy Elliott protégé Sharaya J. With his enviable perch in between the ballroom underground and wider music world, Mike seems poised to follow in their footsteps. But while other stars' ties to ballroom are often overlooked by outsiders, Mike is determined to make sure the scene's history isn't forgotten. ""I'm always sure to speak about Vjuan Allure and make it known,"" he says gravely. ""A lot of people think that I started [ballroom], because they've only heard about me."" Vogue Knights officially starts at 11PM, but the competitions only heat up around 2 AM, leaving the floor to serious ballroom dancers and fans. The streets of Midtown Manhattan are deserted when I roll up to Vogue Knights on a Thursday in mid-July, lit by the distant glow of Times Square a few blocks away. Tonight is the first time the party is taking place at its new home, a gay club called XL, following five years at La Escuelita, a Latin gay club also in Midtown. Mike will DJ the party from start to finish, from 11 PM to around 5 AM. A muffled shout rings out from behind the black marble pillars of an empty office building at the end of the street: "" Michelle!"" I squint and see Mike huddled with four friends, passing around a joint while keeping out of sight from a police station next to the club. Mike looks fresh and relaxed, his denim long-sleeve shirt unbuttoned to reveal a white shirt and silver chains. As I slide into his circle of friends, he stretches his arms over his head and bends forward at the waist in a stretch. ""I'm tired!"" he sigh. ""It's a little dry tonight—but Vogue Knights to me is always a little dry."" A tall, blonde white girl in our midst lifts sparkly chains off someone's neck and sashays down the sidewalk like it's a runway, her legs flashing through a black skirt that's slit up her thigh. ""Let's go back in,"" she calls over her shoulder, and before I get to ask Mike what he meant by his complaint, he turns around and walks briskly back through the club's pink doors. "" Work—work—work,"" instructs a ballroom remix of Rihanna's hit song as he weaves through kids warming up on the sunken dancefloor, headed towards the stage. Bounding up a flight of stairs, he takes his place behind a makeshift DJ booth next to a table of sneering judges in wide-brimmed hats. As if on cue, his trademark drop booms through the speakers, a robotic male voice intoning, ""Dee-jaaay MikeQ."" Over the next few hours, dancers parade in front of the judges, competing in categories with names like ""Old Way"" and ""Femme Queen Vogue."" When competitors try to outdo each other in the ""Runway"" division, where they're judged by the fierceness of their walks, Mike plays warm, smooth house music made for slinking your hips to. One feminine-presenting dancer in a black cape wins the crowd over by pulling out a vape and billowing out a plume of smoke as she sashays down the catwalk. Another competitor is less successful. ""Girl, put down your bag and take off your jacket,"" booms the MC. ""This category is about confidence!"" Later, he explains that DJing at a ball is strictly functional, and requires knowing how to interpret commands and non-verbal cues from the MC in addition to choosing the right sounds for different categories. It's very different from playing a gig at a club, where people are coming out specifically to bask in the music. At a ball, ""my job is someone who creates the soundtrack,"" Mike says. I press Mike on what he meant before by Vogue Knights being ""dry."" ""Vogue Knights is my job—that's how I eat today,"" he begins. Furrowing his brow, he confesses that the rate he gets paid at Vogue Knights pales in comparison to what he pulls as a touring artist: ""$200 a night is nothing, like putting me back in 2007."" His feelings towards Vogue Knights, he says, have changed with his growing success outside the scene. These days, he thinks of the party as a kind of ""community service."" Despite what Mike says about wanting to give back to ballroom, I can't help thinking of an Instagram post I noticed on his feed earlier that night: a screenshot of a text conversation he'd had with the Vogue Knights promoter. After being told he would no longer be allowed to bring in friends for free on his guestlist, Mike texted back saying he needed at least two spots, adding that other clubs give free bottles and other perks when he plays. ""That's just what comes with hiring me in 2016,"" he wrote. He deleted the Instagram post a few days later. The origins of New York's ballroom scene go back as early as 1869, when gay men began holding drag fashion shows, with prizes for the most outrageous costumes. But modern ballroom wasn't born until a century later, when black and Latino drag queens started throwing elaborate ""balls"" in Harlem community centers and other public venues. In the late 1960s, they adopted a new dance called ""voguing,"" inspired by the elegant poses of the women they saw parading down Fifth Avenue and splashed in fashion magazines like Vogue. ""To the drag queens of that time, vogue was a beautiful escape, a way to dance away the pain and oppression they were experiencing,"" Kevin Omni Burrus, a ballroom dancer since 1975, told DNAInfo in 2012. ""But beyond that, it was a celebration of their beauty."" In the 70s, a queen named Crystal LaBeija founded the first ballroom ""house,"" the House of LaBeija. It functioned like a fraternity, with a ""mother"" and ""father"" mentoring younger, less-experienced members. Soon, other rival houses emerged, often named after haute couture labels like Balenciaga and St. Laurent, or qualities its members want to embody, like Xtravaganza and Ninja. The houses became second families for many kids who had nowhere else to turn. ""A lot of gay kids and gay youth were turned away from their own families,"" said Power Infiniti in the Miami New Times interview. ""They found this social network in the clubs and on the streets."" Underneath its flashy surface, ballroom evolved into a complex world with its own hierarchies, customs, and lingo. Going to a ball for the first time, it's hard to understand what's going on—and how exactly one wins a category called ""soft and cunt""—without somebody from the community to guide you. In one of ballroom's first breakthrough moments, nightlife impresario Susanne Bartsch organized a celebrity-studded ballroom competition and AIDS research benefit called the Love Ball in 1989, with David Byrne, Iman, and Vogue's editor-at-large Andre Leon Talley among the judges. According to an article published by Red Bull Music Academy, the Love Ball is said to be where Madonna saw voguing for the first time; her 1990 hit ""Vogue"" paid homage to the dance style's fluid hand gestures and elegant arcs of movement. The same year, cult documentary Paris is Burning by Jennie Livingston exposed the subculture to a worldwide audience. While public interest in ballroom has waxed and waned since its inception, there is no doubt it's seeped into pop culture's collective consciousness over the decades. RuPaul has been a household name since the 90s, and some of ballroom's juiciest slang—like ""throwing shade,"" ""yaaaas,"" ""fierce,"" ""work!""—has filtered down to Bravo-loving suburban moms. More recently, FKA Twigs, Beyoncé, and even Willow Smith have collaborated with vogue dancers on tour and in music videos. Beyoncé told The Independent in 2006 that her fiery alter-ego Sasha Fierce was inspired by the confidence of ballroom dancers. The problem is that ballroom's influence on the mainstream is seldom credited; its signifiers have become familiar but stripped from their original context, leaving the scene and its colorful characters all but invisible to the masses. The ballroom scene also rarely reaps the profits from its popularity. When Paris is Burning was scheduled for a free screening in a New York City park last summer, it re-opened old wounds. Many were offended that the event did not feature any queer and trans people of color from the ballroom community, instead booking white lesbian musician JD Samson, who has little known connection to the scene, to perform as the headliner. A Change.org petition emerged calling for a boycott of the event, calling the film an ""exploitation of a vulnerable population,"" and accusing Livingston of using people ""for the sake of her own fame"" while ""most of the original cast has been murdered or has died in poverty."" In 1991, Livingston distributed $55,000 from the film's profits to 13 cast members, but it did little to appease them. Pepper LaBeija, a dancer who is in the film, told the  New York Times  it was ""hush money."" Mike's ascent to prominence outside the ballroom world was aided partly by good timing, but also by falling in with tastemakers who have the wider music industry's ear. In 2009, Mike met Kingdom, an LA-based DJ and producer born Ezra Rubin who makes experimental, deconstructed club music. ""Ezra asked me if I wanted to be on his label that he was just starting up,"" Mike recalls, referring to what became Fade to Mind. ""From the beginning, Mike knew deep inside he wanted to go further than DJing at balls,"" Kingdom says. ""He wasn't just about making beats—he was doing marketing, pushing his mix CDs, had his own website in the MySpace days... he had big plans [to reach] a broader audience than the community."" In 2012, he dropped Let It All Out on the label. His only solo release to date, the five-track EP was the club world's swaggering introduction to ballroom's prowling rhythms, attitude-filled vocal hooks (""I wanna see a bitch let it all out!"" raps MC Jay Karan on the title track), and signature crashes. In addition to Mike's own production work, Let It All Out featured ballroom pioneers like the DJ/producer Angel X and MC Kevin JZ Prodigy, as well as Jersey club king DJ Sliink—with whom he released a collaborative EP on Fade to Mind with in 2014—as guests.  Following the record's release, the more experimental corners of the electronic music community embraced the genre with gusto, with Kingdom putting his own spin on the ""ha"" sample with his track ""Stalker Ha,"" and Bok Bok getting Vjuan Allure to guest on one of his Rinse shows in 2012. ""The impact was really big because [ Let It All Out] was the first-ever ballroom EP to get a proper full release and be pressed to vinyl. It set into motion this international ballroom movement that has so much potential,"" Kingdom says. That same year, Boiler Room invited Mike to play its first ballroom stream with Kevin JZ Prodigy. In 2014, Fade to Mind and its sister label Night Slugs did a joint re-issue of mid-90s tribal house-inflected battle gem ""Icy Lake,"" and made a documentary with THUMP about it. With his growing profile, Mike started getting booked for gigs across the country. His first time venturing outside the tri-state area for a show was for Diplo's Mad Decent Mondays in LA in 2011. ""After that, ""I started traveling a lot, and everything just blew up from there,"" he says. Last December, I witnessed him DJing another Boiler Room set, this time back-to-back with Night Slugs founder L-VIS 1990, at Brooklyn club Good Room. Dressed in a black shirt with Qween Beat's white geometric logo on it, Mike stood stoically behind the decks, adjusting knobs with quick, precise flicks of his wrist, and exuding a show-stopping confidence. ""Linking up with Fade to Mind, Night Slugs, Diplo, Venus X, GHE20GOTH1K parties—all that helped,"" Mike says. Mike started Qween Beat in 2005. His boyfriend came up with the name; ""It's beats for the queens,"" Mike explains. Up until this point, Qween Beat has functioned mostly as a collective of Mike's friends he'd met online, at The Globe, and in-person. Its 19 members include not just DJs and producers, but rappers and vocalists like Cakes da Killa and Ash B, and dancers like Tokyo-based Koppi Mizrahi. In a way, it felt like Mike was creating a ""house"" of his own. While more conventional ballroom houses—like the Houses of Mizrahi, LaBeija, and Xtravaganza—have DJs and MCs amongst their members, they are still dominated by dancers. Mike is already part of another house called Ebony, but Qween Beat seems uniquely focused on musicians, with the idea that banding together will help these often-overlooked members of the scene expand their pool of resources. As such, many tracks on Qween Beat's first release are collaborations between different artists on the label: Divoli S'vere laid down the garbage can drumming and hard crashes underneath rapper Ash B's rollicking tribute to ""Realness,"" and Jay R Neutron cooked up the electro bleeps that punctuate Gregg Evisu's sandpaper vocals in ""Some Type of Way."" ""It's a family thing,"" Mike explains. ""We're sharing ideas and working with each other."" Perhaps most importantly, the label also allows people in the scene to take ownership of ballroom's popularity—and profit off it. ""This music is something that sells,"" he says bluntly. Still, Mike is protective of the genre he built his career on. Though he touts Queen Beat as the world's first ""ballroom label,"" Mike is careful to draw the line between ""pure ballroom"" and ""ballroom-inspired"" music. Lots of producers all over the world have been labeling their music as ""ballroom"" because they use the genre's trademark sounds, he says, but ""just because you use a 'ha' sample doesn't make it a ballroom track."" Most of the ballroom-inspired tracks being played at clubs would never work at a ball, he says, because ballroom dancers wouldn't be able to dance to their off-kilter rhythms. ""I can't have people call their music ballroom just because they're [associated] with me,"" Mike says. From the way he talks about the label, I can sense that Mike has a complicated relationship with the spotlight.He tells me that Qween Beat's first release only features one of his tracks—a collab with the late Daft Punk collaborator Romanthony—because he doesn't want the focus to be on him. ""Everybody can't get signed to Fade to Mind the same way I was,"" he says. ""That's what Qween Beat is for."" But in the same breath, he confesses that managing the egos and resolving conflicts of the ever-growing Qween Beat family can have its toll. ""Sometimes I get discouraged and want to end it, because I could just be doing MikeQ—which not everybody understands,"" he says. But he's determined to soldier on. ""I'm not gonna stop. Ballroom was a place for me to find myself and take those talents outside,"" he says. ""I think that should be the goal for everyone in ballroom."" Even as the most prominent member of the Qween Beat roster, achieving that goal hasn't always been straightforward for Mike. For one thing, the support he receives inside the scene doesn't necessarily translate beyond the ballroom floor. ""It's really hard to get ballroom people to support anything outside of ballroom,"" Mike says, explaining that many people in the community don't even know—or care—who the DJ is. ""At a ball, your name can barely even get on a flyer. A lot of people don't really know what I look like."" Mike's stature in the ballroom scene doesn't necessarily translate to success in the wider music industry, either. On a rainy Tuesday night in July, he plays at a show at Baby's Alright that is part of Red Bull Sound Selects, a program that uses bigger acts to draw attention to its roster of emerging artists. Tonight's event was put together by Sound Select artist Cakes da Killa, who asked Big Freedia to play as the headliner and put Mike, his friend, at the end of the night. Unfortunately for Mike, most of the crowd ends up filing out after Big Freedia's set, leaving him to open his set playing Byrell the Great's ""Legendary Children""—the opening track off Qweendom—to a nearly empty room, scattered with a handful of sweaty dancers. After the show, hanging around outside the venue waiting to get paid, his frustration is clear. ""Big Freedia ruined my set!,"" he says to Cakes, loud enough for the dozen or so friends clustered around them to hear. ""Next time, don't book Freedia. You coulda booked Qween Beat!"" He proceeds to rattle off names of his artists, telling Cakes they could have used the opportunity to fly out the ones living outside of New York. Cakes contritely asks if they can all just hang out now that the show is over, but Mike says he has to pack for a trip to Toronto the next day. In 2013, Mike almost had a breakout moment when Missy Elliott hit him up to work on a ballroom track for her protégé Sharaya—who grew up going to balls in New York City. Mike says she ended up going with another producer named DJ Jayhood who makes Jersey Club—a genre he thinks Missy felt had broader appeal. (The song ended up being Sharaya's hit single, ""Banji."") As a gesture of friendship, Missy recorded a secret ballroom track for Mike where she tries her hand at ballroom-style rapping, throwing in its choice slang terms like ""cunt!"" along with her own trademark ""BRRRR!"" Although the song was never released, Mike says he played it at one of his Boiler Room sets and it immediately went viral, after a fan ripped the song off the stream and posted it online. In some ways, the track feels like a symbol of ballroom's position in the pop culture world: instantly appealing with plenty of commercial potential, but lacking in institutional support. In many ways, Mike reflects the tensions within ballroom culture at large—eager to break out into the mainstream but fiercely loyal to the scene and its traditions, frustrated with the lack of outside recognition by unwilling to give up where he came from in order to get there. After all, voguing is both a fantasy and an act of defiance—the dancers know they will probably never end up on the cover of Vogue, but engage in a performance of upward-mobility in the face of systematic injustice, reclaiming feminine beauty from rich white women. For better or worse, despite the waves of press declaring ballroom's imminent breakout into the mainstream, and all of its celebrity endorsements, ballroom has remained stubbornly underground. But if there's one aspect of the culture that can transcend above its insular customs and appeal to a broad range of people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds, it's the music—and if there's one person who can be trusted to bring this music to a wider audience without watering it down, it's MikeQ. For his part, Mike says doesn't need to actively participate in ball culture to stay connected to the scene. ""I don't really go to house meetings and I don't travel for balls. Especially because I don't enjoy being out in public much,"" he says, calling his job as a DJ who travels everywhere for gigs is ""ironic."" ""I'm more of a smoker,"" he says with a deep inhale of the blunt we shared in his room. ""I'd rather just be in the house chilling."" Mike is a study in contradictions—a shy introvert who found himself in an extremely extroverted scene that's all about peacocking. Maybe this is why he turned to DJing, which allowed him to engage with a culture that took him out of suburban New Jersey and into the thriving gay, black underground of New York City, without having to be at the center of attention. Still, when I meet him to the Latex Ball, I find him surrounded by his Qween Beat fam at the end of the runway, cheering on the dancers on stage. Suddenly, a fight breaks out between a dancer and a judge over a perceived slight. The dancer leaps onto the judges' table, sending drinks spilling everywhere. She gets dragged offstage by security, kicking and punching, but two seconds later she's back, spitting water at her target. 3,000 people on the dancefloor and hanging off the balconies erupt into hoots over the spilled blood—or in this case, spilled tequila soda—and Mike takes a Snapchat of the chaos. Then he shakes his head. ""This is embarrassing,"" he says to me in a low voice, like a father whose child is throwing a tantrum at church. Near the end of the night, he goes to pay his respects to Vjuan Allure, who DJs the ball every year. Sitting on stage with his arms splayed across two CDJs, Vjuan cuts a striking figure, wearing a glittery cap that says ""READ"" and wiggling his hefty frame in his chair to the music. Every few minutes, Vjuan—who also dances at balls—can't help himself from breaking into vogue hands when playing a particularly hot track. His exuberance is a total contrast to Mike, who stands next to him reverently, like a statue. Before he leaves to catch his train, Mike slips a CD of the Qween Beat compilation to Vjuan. At the end of our day in New Jersey together, Mike drives me back to the PATH station in Newark. In contrast to our sunny drive to his house, the lengthening shadows imbue the streets of the city with an air of danger, and at one traffic light, Mike casually mentions that he was once shot at while waiting at the same intersection. A few minutes later, he points to a street crawling with rugged men, calling it the ""weed and xanax corner."" As we approach the train station, the towering blue glass windows of a flashy stadium call",,,
415,415,29-11-18 00:00,2018,11,29,Ludwig Burger,"Bayer to sell businesses, cut jobs after Monsanto deal","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (BAYGn.DE), the German drugmaker that bought U.S. seed company Monsanto, announced on Thursday the sale of a number of businesses, around 12,000 job cuts and 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in impairments.  Chief Executive Werner Baumann is under pressure to boost Bayer’s share price after a drop of more than 35 percent so far this year, dragged down by concern over more than 9,000 lawsuits it faces over an alleged cancer-causing effect of Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer.  The group said it was looking at options - that could include a sale - for the Coppertone sunscreen and Dr. Scholl’s foot care products from the consumer healthcare division it bought from Merck & Co (MRK.N) in 2014 for $14 billion.  It will also divest its animal health division, the number five player in the industry, which analysts have said could fetch 6-7 billion euros ($7.9 billion).  The unit, the largest maker of flea and tick control products for cats and dogs and a supplier of livestock veterinary drugs, had sales of 1.57 billion euros in 2017, accounting for about 4.5 percent of group revenues.  There has already been consolidation in animal health, with Pfizer (PFE.N) and Eli Lilly (LLY.N), successfully floating their veterinary medicine units on the stock market as independent entities.     Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis (ZTS.N), the former Pfizer unit, Elanco (ELAN.N), unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi (SASY.PA), and drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N).   Bayer will also seek a buyer for its 60-percent stake in German chemical production site services provider Currenta.  All three possible transactions were previously flagged by Reuters.  Its shares were down 0.8 percent in late trade.   Markus Mayer, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s could fetch 1 billion euros and the Currenta stake could fetch 1.5 billion euros.  Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) will likely be among the suitors for the consumer brands, said investment bankers, who asked not to be named.  Under a cost cutting program that will also target synergies expected from the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto, Bayer will cut around 12,000 of its 118,200 jobs worldwide.  At the Consumer Health and Pharmaceuticals divisions, Bayer will take about 3.3 billion euros in impairments and write-offs the fourth quarter.  Consumer Health brands acquired with the Merck & Co. and Dihon businesses will account for 2.7 billion euros of that, while about 600 million euros impairments and write-offs are due to a decision not to utilize a hemophilia drug factory in the German city of Wuppertal and to concentrate production in Berkeley, United States.   The consumer healthcare unit, which sells non-prescription treatments, has faced falling revenues as U.S. consumers went from established drugstores to online shops, often switching to cheaper brands.  In the first nine months of 2018, Bayer consumer health products’ sales declined by 0.4 percent when excluding currency swings, following a drop of 1.7 percent in the full year of 2017.  The company said it was targeting core earnings per share of 6.80 euros in 2019, up from an expected 5.70 to 5.90 euros this year, with a 2022 target of around 10 euros, when discounting the effect of currency swings and portfolio changes.      The group’s margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and special items over sales should increase to over 30 percent by 2022, up from 26.5 percent last year, it added.

416,416,10-05-19 18:10,2019,5,10,Kelsey Piper,Cage-free eggs: Washington law bans small cages for egg-laying hens,"Finding the best ways to do good. Made possible by The Rockefeller Foundation. On Wednesday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a bill setting welfare requirements for egg-laying hens — the strongest such bill ever to pass a state legislature. By 2023, it will be illegal to sell eggs in Washington if the hens were raised in excessively small cages. The law will affect about eight million hens each year. The Washington law follows up on the success of ballot measures in California and Massachusetts, which imposed similar requirements. The Humane Society of the United States has spearheaded campaigns like this one in more than a dozen states, and in the past few years, these campaigns have started to get results. Why is this a big deal? Because millions of birds live on factory farms producing eggs, and the conditions they’re kept in are pretty terrible. We’re finally making progress towards improving those conditions. There are many ways to raise egg-laying hens on a factory farm. One method, battery cages, keeps each hen in an area about 67-76 square inches big (that’s approximately the dimensions of an iPad). Birds show a lot of distress under those conditions, tending to injure themselves, lose their feathers, and end up covered with cuts and bruises. The alternative methods aren’t great for birds either, but welfare researchers think they’re a little better. The cheapest alternative method (and therefore the one that most producers will likely switch to) is called an aviary system. Those look like this: Aviary systems have their problems — in particular, with more mobility and freedom comes more ways for birds to get injured or sick — but on the whole, they seem to cause less suffering. Washington will require that birds have enough space to turn around and spread their wings; that they’ll have access to perches and dust baths; and that they will be able to socialize with other birds. It’s a start on the path toward humane conditions. Washington’s law isn’t unique — it’s a lot like the California or Massachusetts laws — but it’s unique in one important way: it’s the first time a law like this has happened through the state government, instead of directly through voters. For the most part, voters have been more concerned with animal cruelty than our representatives have been. Initiatives that protect animal welfare have had a striking success rate at the ballot box. Voters have banned gestation crates and battery cages in California and Massachusetts, limited puppy mills in Missouri, and restricted the sale of ivory and animal parts in Oregon and Washington. Meanwhile, legislatures have tended to push the other way. Six state legislatures have banned undercover investigations of factory farms, Iowa passed a law requiring grocers to sell caged eggs, and the federal government is contemplating restrictions on cell-based meat (which is produced without slaughtering animals). The last major federal bill targeting farm animal welfare was introduced in 2010, and it never passed. That’s an unusual level of disconnect between constituents and lawmakers. One explanation is that agricultural lobbies tend to be politically powerful and well-connected, and can usually discourage legislators from taking animal welfare concerns too seriously, while they tend to lose when factory farming practices have to be defended to the public. Washington’s law is a welcome sign that things might be changing. Protections for animal welfare are a good idea — politically popular, morally necessary, and not even all that costly. If legislators have started to get on board, that’s great news. Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter. Twice a week, you’ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and — to put it simply — getting better at doing good",https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/10/18564455/washington-jay-inslee-hens-animal-cruelty,,Vox
417,417,16-05-18 19:00,2018,5,16,Kaila Yu,Denny's Helped Me Realize I Could Be Both Chinese and American,"Denny’s came into my life in the 6th grade. I had just earned straight As on my report card so I was able to choose any restaurant I wanted to eat at to celebrate. On the rare occasions that my Chinese-American family would eat out, we would go to the local Chinese place, with soggy sweet-and-sour pork that had been sitting out under the heated lamps too long and limp and lifeless chow mein.  For me, Denny’s was the exact opposite. It was the ultimate representation of Americana, existing in sharp contrast to the complex and colorless thousand-year-old-egg-embedded jook that my mother would ladle out for breakfast. It felt like the nerd versus the prom queen, played out in food.  Even my mom would enjoy our meals at Denny’s (although she would never neglect to mention that we could have had Chinese food for half the price). What’s not to love—big steaks, bottomless sodas, and friendly waitresses who come by to check on you. I loved how we didn’t have to share our meals family-style, and how they arrived in courses: first a plate of crusty, buttered bread; salad with too much ranch dressing (just how I liked it); and then steak with a steaming hot baked potato and all the butter and sour cream I could fit inside. Here, on a plate, was the American Dream.   To my young mind, being an all-American teenager was all about rebellion and excess. The “Belgian Waffle Slam” thought so too, with two sunny-side up eggs and two pieces each of bacon and sausage. The star, of course, was the golden, crispy Belgian waffle, topped off by generous amounts of whipped cream, butter, and strawberry jam. My mother would never allow me to order this kind of food under her watch and would moan in Chinese, “Why is it so expensive?” and “Why would one person need so much food?”  My Denny’s was the preeminent late-night hot spot in Upland, California in 1994, which says a lot about Upland as a city. Much like Denny’s—which first opened its doors as a donut shop in Lakewood, California—I also had my transformational coming of age in the outskirts of Los Angeles. As a sophomore at Upland High School, I was the obedient apple of my dragon mother’s eye and on track to go to Stanford. But her Chinese-immigrant American dream for me died a sudden death when I met Jessica.   Jessica was a perfectly oval-faced Korean beauty with a full-bodied mane of Pantene-glossed hair. She had just transferred to Upland High less than a year ago, and was just a sophomore herself but looked and acted like a college student. In a fortuitous turn of events, I became Jessica’s math tutor and helped her get a C (she was flunking out of class at the time). In return, she took me under her wing.  The first time Jessica and I hung out was at Denny’s. Its country-inspired design and red and caramel brown booths were at odds with her glamour and effortless charm, but it was nonetheless her favorite hangout spot. (It helped that it was the only place open at 1 am on a Tuesday night in Upland.) You couldn’t miss it; the banana-colored hexagonal sign and its cherry lettering shouted for attention. I cried for attention too, sneaking out of my house in the middle of the night wearing nothing but a micro-mini and X-Girl baby doll crop top.  Our favorite thing to order at Denny’s was the ham-and-egg sandwich they inexplicably call “Moons Over My Hammy.” The griddle-browned crunch of the sourdough bread paired perfectly with not one, but two cheeses: Swiss and American. That was an important lesson in American excess—one cheese is  never enough. At 2 AM in Denny's with Jessica, I felt like a total badass and began to act the part—sneaking out at night, making out with boys, and breaking all the rules that I had so judiciously followed for so many years. The American teenagers that I watched in the movies chased their own dreams and made independent choices in life. Now, so could I, at least within the confines of Denny’s ‘Build Your Own Sampler’: nothing was stopping me from curating myself a plate of mozzarella cheese sticks, seasoned fries, and deep-fried chicken strips with ranch, ketchup, and honey mustard sauce. Jessica would often make conversation with whoever was in the vicinity, whether it be our waitress or the people in the neighboring booth. She was extremely outgoing and friendly, and it really brought me out of my shell. She taught me how to socialize like a regular American teenager.  On top of that, Jessica would invite her out-of-town friends to come visit us in Denny’s. I was so impressed that these guys would drive 30-45 minutes just to visit us, from far away, heavily populated Asian cities like Cerritos and Hacienda Heights. They drove souped-up, lowered to the ground Acura Integras and were members of Asian gangs like “Dub C” or the Asian Boyz. It was at Denny’s where boys first paid attention to me, and I was confident enough to interact back.  It wasn’t long after these excursions to Denny’s that I found myself on the arm of a new boyfriend named Andy, a 21-year-old Chinese guy with a teased-up pompadour and a zero fade. He drove a shiny purple Civic that was slammed to the floor and had a custom stainless steel exhaust. He would pick me up and drive me to faraway late night Chinese cafes like Garden Cafe and St Honors in Monterey Park, and thanks to him, I finally began to see the beauty in my own culture.   Garden Cafe was loud and bustling with plates of food flying over our heads and filled with a bunch of teenagers and college students hopped up on hot milk tea and condensed milk. Instead of the various Grand Slam choices, we opted for greasy beef chow fun noodles and my favorite fiery red candied sweet tomato beef rice. The humdrum food of my childhood in Upland somehow became exalted in Monterey Park, and once more embraced as part of my culture and identity.   That didn’t mean that I still didn’t love Denny’s. The food there, while maybe not healthy by any particular stretch of the imagination, was intensely nourishing in a way that I needed in those tender and formative years, like a warm hug from a worn out teddy bear that told me it was ok to step outside my comfort zone. There, I learned that I could be proud to be Asian and I could be just as proud to be American too. ",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3kv3j/dennys-chinese-american,Food by VICE ,Vice

Wildlife official Ravi Ralph told the BBC that he believes the leopard came from a patch of forest not far from the school. Bangalore is often referred to as India's Silicon Valley, known for its modern metropolis and thriving information technology community. The population of Bangalore grew by 47 percent in the decade between 2001 and 2011, and the size of the city swelled over 300 percent in 20 years. The urban sprawl has eaten into rural areas and forests on the city's outskirts, invading leopards' natural habitats and forcing them to become accidental or unwanted intruders.  Last September, the first official survey of leopards in India revealed that the total population of spotted felines to be somewhere between 12,000 and 14,000. Previous estimations put the figure anywhere between 10,000 and 45,000 nationwide. ",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/ywjq7m/leopard-injures-six-in-school-invasion-in-india,,Vice News

421,421,27-07-17 00:00,2017,7,27,VICE News,Donald Trump's highly abnormal presidency: a running guide for the week of July 24,"Sign up for a weekly newsletter about President Donald Trump to be delivered to your inbox every Friday. Donald Trump made it clear at the beginning of his campaign that he wasn’t going to follow the normal rules or tone of politics. We’re keeping track of all the ways his presidency veers from the norm in terms of policy and rhetoric. Anthony Scaramucci has been the White House communications director for less than a week, but he has already expressed some — to put it politely — strong opinions about his co-workers.  Take, for instance, Scaramucci’s take on the mental health of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, which he volunteered to The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza: “Reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.” Or Scaramucci’s thoughts on White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s apparent love of media attention: “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock. I’m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I’m here to serve the country.” Scaramucci sounded off on Priebus and Bannon during the call to Lizza, which he apparently made in an effort to find out which White House staffer had leaked details about a recent dinner between President Donald Trump and Fox News personality Sean Hannity. When Lizza refused to reveal his source, “The Mooch” — as Scaramucci referred to himself during the call — decided that Priebus had to be the leaker. (Scaramucci reportedly referred to himself in the third person multiple times during the call.) “They’ll all be fired by me,” Scaramucci said of the alleged leakers. “I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I’ll fire tomorrow. I’ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus — if you want to leak something — he’ll be asked to resign very shortly.” In other words, Scaramucci seems like a perfect fit for serving in a reality TV-spawned presidency: He’s here for the right reasons — and it’s not to make friends. The Boy Scouts’ motto may be to always be prepared, but as it turns out, nobody can prepare for President Donald Trump.  Chief scout executive for the Boy Scouts, Michael Surbaugh, apologized Thursday to people who may have been offended by Trump’s speech to the roughly 30,000 Boy Scouts who attended the 2017 National Jamboree last week.  “The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition that has been extended to the leader of our nation that has had a Jamboree during his term since 1937,” Subaugh wrote. “It is in no way an endorsement of any person, party or policies. For years, people have called upon us to take a position on political issues, and we have steadfastly remained non-partisan and refused to comment on political matters. We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program.” Trump had used the speech not only to hint that he would fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions and to talk up the latest national jobs report — even though children are probably not all that worried about their job prospects at the moment — but to also rehash his election win. Yes, again. “Do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable, and they didn’t know what to say?” Trump asked the child-filled crowd, who likely didn’t remember that night since Trump’s victory was declared long past their bedtimes. The president also thanked the crowd for voting for him — even though kids can’t vote. The meeting between Don. Jr and the Russians in Trump Tower last year was “absolutely” a Kremlin-backed effort to repeal the Magnitsky Act. That’s the assertion by Bill Browder, the American financier who was expelled from Russia for exposing corruption, in his testimony to the Judiciary committee Thursday. Browder also testified that the lawyer who wanted the meeting in the first place, Natalia Veselnitskaya, “was definitely working for the Russians — no question.” “Nobody was talking about adoption,” Browder said, speaking in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday morning. “They were talking about repealing the Magnitsky Act so that Russian torturers and murderers could freely travel and keep their money in the U.S.”  Browder alleged that not only was Veselnitskaya the point person for the Kremlin, but that Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian-American lobbyist who is believed to have worked with a Russian counterintelligence unit and was also present in the meeting, was also working on behalf of Moscow. He is a registered lobbyist for Veselnitskaya’s organization, according to CNN. “There’s no such thing as a former intel officer in Russia — like Hotel California, check out but never leave,” said Browder.  The Magnitsky Act — a tool that allows the U.S. to deny visas to, or freeze assets of, human rights violators — was initially passed in 2012 after a Russian anti-corruption lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who worked under Browder, died after being tortured in a Moscow prison in 2009. Browder says that the Act is of direct importance to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he believes to have amassed a fortune of around $200 billion stashed in banks around the world, and his associates.  About two weeks before the meeting, June 9, 2016, Trump had clinched the Republican nomination for the presidential election. As rumors about the president’s intention to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions continue to fly, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN, “If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay.” Trump is pissed that Sessions recused himself in March from the DOJ’s Russia investigation, and he’s not happy with the guy heading that investigation, Robert Mueller, either. To get rid of both Sessions and Mueller, Trump could fire Sessions and appoint someone willing to fire Mueller. But Graham’s comments make clear that the political backlash for a firing spree like that might be too great if Trump wants to keep any friends in Congress. “Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency,” said the South Carolina senator. Graham went a step further and will reportedly introduce legislation that would prevent anyone from firing Mueller without a court’s review. Donald Trump’s newly appointed communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, isn’t wasting any time tackling the deluge of leaks coming from the White House. Having already fired one assistant press secretary and warning that he’ll “fire everybody” to stop leakers, Scaramucci now appears to be angling to get White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus investigated by the FBI. On Wednesday night Scaramucci tweeted — and quickly deleted — the following message: “In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #Swamp @Reince45…” The communications director was referencing reports that he stands to profit from his investment firm while in office, based on previously undisclosed financial disclosure forms. This led many to suggest Scaramucci wanted Priebus investigated for any possible part in leaking the documents — which are not classified.  The New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza tweeted: “I can confirm that Scaramucci wants the FBI to investigate Reince for leaking.” The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, Philip Rucker, added that some within the administration are preparing a chart of leakers to show Trump, implicating Priebus. Seven hours after posting his original message, Scaramucci denied claims that he was seeking to get Priebus investigated. It looks like the Pentagon didn’t know the president was going to ban transgender people from the military Wednesday. During the nine minutes between President Trump’s first and second tweets Wednesday morning, some at the Pentagon feared that Trump was going to announce a strike on North Korea, BuzzFeed News reported. It was only after the second tweet that many at the Department of Defense understood that the president was announcing a change to military personnel policies over Twitter. Trump blamed the ban on costs and disruption associated with trans people, saying the military must be “focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” Officials seemed taken aback despite Trump saying he’d consulted with generals on the decision. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s new press secretary, appeared caught off-guard when she was questioned about the Pentagon’s surprise at the announcement. “When the president made the decision yesterday, the Secretary of Defense was immediately informed as were the rest of the national security team that had been part of this ongoing conversation,” she said. Making an announcement like this through a tweet is unprecedented. Never before has a president reversed a military personnel policy through Twitter. And a tweet alone doesn’t change a standing policy.  An estimated 1,320 to 6,620 transgender individuals serve on active duty in the military, according to a report by Rand. The president’s tweets were met with strong bipartisan backlash and a flood of tweets by defiant trans military people. Donald Trump started this week by bigly lying to the American people. Between 6:31 p.m. on July 24 and 8:09 p.m. on July 25, the president made 29 claims that were either false or misleading, according to an analysis from the Washington Post.  That’s more than one per hour, or even more, assuming that Trump sleeps — although his 4 a.m. tweets suggest otherwise. The claims, made at rallies in Ohio and West Virginia, plus a flurry of tweets, ran the gamut from Trump perennials to new favorites: Most people, upon hearing that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had invented a revolutionary new biofuel made of alcohol and pig manure, might raise a skeptical eyebrow. Not Donald Trump’s energy secretary, Rick Perry. In a world where people are quick to cry “Fake news!,” Perry displayed a refreshing wide-eyed innocence, calling the idea “interesting” and saying the fuel would make Poroshenko “a very, very, wealthy and successful man.” There was just one problem: Perry was being had. In a phone conversation Tuesday, he believed he was talking to Ukraine’s Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. In fact, Perry was speaking to two well-known Russian pranksters — Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov — who have built a reputation for fooling celebrities, including Elton John, tricked into thinking he was speaking to Vladimir Putin. During the 22-minute call on July 19, Perry  — whose department oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons program — also spoke to the pair known as the “Jerky Boys of Russia” about sanctions against Russia, U.S. objections to a potential pipeline across the Baltic sea for Russian gas, attacks against the U.S. power grid, and Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump said Apple promised to build “three big plants, beautiful plants” in the United States during an interview with the Wall Street Journal Tuesday — a move that would be entirely unheard-of for Apple, as it outsources nearly all of its manufacturing abroad. “I spoke to [CEO Tim Cook]. He’s promised me three big plants — big, big, big,” Trump said, without specifying where these plants will be located or when they’re expected. “I said, you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won’t consider my administration an economic success. He called me, and he said they are going forward.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from VICE News, and they declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal. As the Senate debated whether to take healthcare away from millions of Americans Tuesday, President Trump zeroed in on one citizen in particular, depriving her of his most precious tender of all — his tweets. He blocked model Chrissy Teigen on Twitter. The 31-year-old celebrity, a Clinton supporter who is married to the musician John Legend, has been bashing Trump for years, and once referred to him as “the fucking most vile person on this planet.” But her latest tweet apparently was the last straw for Trump. She got the axe after responding to his Sunday tweet about a lack of Republican support, saying, “Lolllllll no one likes you.” Teigen joins a veritable brigade of famous and semi-famous people who have been blocked by the president, including novelist Stephen King and actress Marina Sirtis. Donald Trump continued his very public campaign against “beleaguered” Jeff Sessions Tuesday by telling reporters gathered in the White House’s Rose Garden that “time will tell” if the president ultimately fires his attorney general.  “I am disappointed in the attorney general,” Trump said of Sessions — the same person he glowingly nominated to the position just six months ago — during a press conference Tuesday. Trump continued: He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else. So I think that’s a bad thing, not for the president but for the presidency. I think it’s unfair to the presidency, and that’s the way I feel. A person close to Sessions told the Daily Beast that the attorney general is “pissed” but not ready to resign. Trump shared his feelings on Sessions during an unfettered interview with the New York Times last week. Since then, Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions on Twitter. Want to know if President Donald Trump is mentally ill? You can now get a professional opinion. On Tuesday, the American Psychoanalytic Association became the first major professional psychiatric organization to announce that it would back away from a rule forbidding psychologists and psychiatrists from discussing people they haven’t treated, and permit its members to publicly discuss Trump’s mental stability (or lack thereof). This rule, the so-called Goldwater Rule, dates back to the 1970s, when many psychiatrists publicly announced that Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was unfit to be president. After Goldwater sued a magazine for libel — and won — the nation’s professional psychiatry organizations later asked its members to refrain from commenting on people they haven’t personally treated. And for over 30 years, the rule went relatively unchallenged. Cue Trump. Just a few weeks after his inauguration, in a letter to the New York Times, 33 psychiatrists publicly broke with the Goldwater Rule by writing, “Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).” The doctors also criticized the Goldwater Rule for leading psychiatrists to shirk their civic duties, saying, “This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time.” Still, don’t expect a sudden outpouring of armchair diagnoses of the president’s mental health: The American Psychiatric Association, one of the nation’s largest professional psychiatry groups, reaffirmed its commitment to the Goldwater Rule on Tuesday. Donald Trump woke up on the wrong side of the bed Tuesday, with undermining on his mind. Just after 6 a.m. Washington time, the president began his day by repeating a baseless claim on Twitter that Ukraine tried to undermine his election campaign last year. He then turned his attention to his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, once again undermining his position by calling him “ very weak.” Trump has been angry with Sessions ever since he recused himself from the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Trump reportedly called a political associate in recent days to ask what would happen if he fired Sessions. The president has also raised the idea of replacing him – with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Ted Cruz among the names floated as possible replacements. The most recent attack on Sessions comes just a day after Trump called him “beleaguered” for failing to look into “crooked Hillary’s crimes and Russia relations.” In a remarkable admission to the New York Times Friday, Trump said he would never have picked Sessions as AG if he knew he would recuse himself. “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,” the president told the Times. Sessions said last week that he intends to stay in the role for “as long as is appropriate,” but new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci had a warning for him Tuesday. Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt show, Scaramucci was asked whether Trump wanted to fire Sessions. “I do know the president very well, and if there’s this level of tension in the relationship, that’s public, then you’re probably right,” he replied. Having attacked Sessions once again, Trump then turned his attention to Republicans in Congress, warning that they need to vote to repeal Obamacare later Tuesday, and indicating that he was willing to sign whatever bill was put in front of him. Trump rounded out his busy morning Twitter session by praising son-in-law Jared Kushner and calling the Russia investigation a “witch hunt.” Donald Trump is having a hard time holding on to his employees. From Sally Yates to Michael Flynn, Pheet Bharara, James Comey, and most recently Sean Spicer, the revolving door at the White House has been turning fast in the last six months. Now it seems that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could be next through the door. In what’s being called “Rexit,” Tillerson has reportedly told friends he will be “lucky to last a year in his job,” as frustrations grow over his department’s ability to act independently from the president. Sources speaking to Reuters, CNN, and Politico all claim that Tillerson is upset at not having autonomy and the ability to do the job the way it’s traditionally done. The reports also reveal that H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, is frustrated at the “disorganization and indiscipline” on key policy issues inside the White House. One of the main bones of contention for McMaster is that Trump has largely ignored calls to take a tougher stance on Russia, with the president still challenging the assertion of the U.S. intelligence community that the Kremlin was involved in meddling with the 2016 election. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was the first U.S. senator to endorse Donald Trump during the campaign. Now, he is the latest to be ostracized by him.  Trump and his close advisers are reportedly considering replacing Sessions, the Washington Post and the Associated Press reported Monday, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani both on a shortlist of possible replacements.  The president has had private conversations about both the possibility of firing Sessions and the possible consequences of him resigning, according to the Post, which also reported that some in Trump’s close circle believe Trump’s dissatisfaction is part of a broader desire to shut down the investigation into the administration’s relationship to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The Russia investigation and Sessions’ recusal from it is at the center of the debacle: Trump told the Times in an interview last week that he would never have hired Sessions if he’d known he was going to recuse himself.  “Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president,” Trump told the paper. “How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you.’ It’s extremely unfair — and that’s a mild word — to the president.” Trump also publicly criticized Sessions on Twitter Monday for not investigating Hillary Clinton and Russia ties, calling him a “beleaguered A.G.” Anthony Scaramucci, the president’s new communications director, addressed the tension Monday. “My own personal opinion: I think they’ve got to have a meeting and have a reconciliation one way or another. You know what I mean? Either stay or go, one way or another,” he said, according to the Associated Press. Jobs, cocktail parties with “the hottest people in New York,” and loyalty — those were just some of the topics President Trump raised in front of a sea of young Boy Scouts in West Virginia Monday.   Speaking at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree — an event held once every four years — Trump took the opportunity to relive the glory of his election, asking the child audience, “Do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable, and they didn’t know what to say?” Trump also hit on his favorite theme of “fake news,” complaining that the media would probably downplay the size of the crowd of Boy Scouts he was speaking in front of. “The fake media will say: President Trump — and you know what this is — President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That’s some — that is some crowd,” Trump said, adding, “Fake media. Fake news. Thank you.”  Trump also bragged about the economy, telling the scouts about the state of unemployment in the U.S. and promising to bring back “trillions of dollars.” “We had the best jobs report in 16 years,” Trump said. “The stock market on a daily basis is hitting an all-time high. We’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars from companies that can’t get their money back into this country, and that money is going to be used to help rebuild America.” Amid rumors swirling about the possible replacement of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and on the eve of the critical Senate healthcare vote, Trump said, “We could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.” At one point, Trump went on a bizarre anecdotal tangent about the Long Island developer who created Levittown, telling the assembled children how William Levitt made a “tremendous amount of money,” selling his company, and “bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life.”  Then Trump seemed to censor himself, telling the adolescents, “I won’t go any more than that because you’re Boy Scouts, so I’m not going to tell you what he did.”  Still, Trump recalled that he saw Levitt years later in New York, after he had lost his wealth and “failed badly.” “I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party,” Trump told the assembled children. The problem? “He lost his momentum.  Meaning, he took this period of time off long — years — and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.”  A cautionary tale — but for whom? Anthony Scaramucci, the new communications director for the White House, told CNN Sunday that the president had called him from Air Force One the previous day to say “Maybe they did it, maybe they didn’t do it.” Trump’s doubt apparently stems from his belief that Russian hackers are so good that they’d evade detection. Scaramucci said Trump told him: “If the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it, you would have never had any evidence of them.” After saying in early July, “It could very well have been Russia. I think it could well have been other countries,” Trump still appears undecided about the Kremlin’s involvement in undermining the presidential election — despite a rare consensus among the intelligence agencies that Russia did have a hand in hacking the DNC servers and releasing sensitive information to benefit Trump’s grab for the White House. Trump will face a tough decision in relation to Russia this week: legislation designed to increase sanctions against the Kremlin. While the president is expected to sign the bill, he and Vladimir Putin had sought to avoid such actions following their numerous meetings at the G-20 summit in early July.

422,422,09-03-17 21:23,2017,3,9,Brigitte  Noël,How Preppers from Around the World Are Gearing Up for Doomsday,"Skirt lengths might be a good barometer for the state of the economy, but what do hazmat suit sales tell us about the world we live in?  Much like economist George Taylor's ""hemline theory,"" which claims that miniskirts mean positive things for a country's financial health, general consumer statistics on the sale of things like luxury goods, alcohol, and even porn can provide a good read of the general social climate. Four-inch heels apparently mean an economic downturn, and kinky porn habits can offer commentary on social oppression.  In uncertain times, it seems normal for citizens to cut spending or seek creature comforts.  The popularity of survivalist merchandise—gear used to prepare for a cataclysm or the end of times—offers interesting insight into people's anxieties concerning natural disasters, political situations, or even technological development. For instance, a recent report states that rich Silicon Valley innovators are building shelters to hide from the popular revolt that will occur when robots steal all of our jobs, which is very reassuring.  I wanted to learn more about these types of trends, so I contacted survivalist stores in Canada, France, and the US to find out what has been driving their clientele's purchases.   VICE: So your store sells army surplus and survivalist stuff?   Pascal Lemieux: Yeah, we've been around for 25 years, and we started as an army surplus store. But I developed a survivalist section after September 11 because there was a demand; people were suddenly conscious that stuff like that could happen in America.   Our sales depend on what's happening on the planet. There are peaks during political conflicts, US and Russia stuff, or natural disasters. Like Fukushima in Japan—that was a peak in sales. During the next year or so, people were buying anti-radiation stuff, gas masks, chemical-protection suits—those one pieces with a hood and a mask.   But the Fukushima disaster is pretty far from Quebec, no?  Radiation has no boundaries, never forget that.    Did you notice any particular trends in the last year, with the Trump election?  No, not really. I think that's more affected the immigration side of things. Where we see changes is really during like political stuff of Cold War–type situations, that's when people feel like something could happen. Or when there are attacks, like what happened in Boston.   It's tough to tell, though, because often people buy stuff without telling you what it's for.    Do you know if people are building bunkers?  I don't know, but you're not supposed to talk about that. What I can tell you is that more and more families are getting prepared.    VICE: How long have you been doing this?  Neal Crasnow: I've been in Army Navy business for 35 years. This store has been here in central Florida for 60 years.   Is it a big business out in Florida? I think there are all sorts of people that collect all sorts of different things. Whether they're preppers or survivalists, that's a good question, and what they're actually waiting for is an even better question. So I don't know if it's the zombie apocalypse or any number of other things.  They come in and look for different things. I sell all kinds of fire starting equipment, water-purification equipment, backpacks, and firearms and all kinds of things like that.   Do you see any patterns? Are there items that sell more during certain periods?  Well, for the US, when there is a chance that a Democrat will get elected to office, then firearms sell better. If you remember the whole thing about the year 2000, the computers, there was a whole group of people who were worried about that, so they would go out and they were buying those [survivalist] things.  When people are worried, they make arrangements. I sell a lot during hurricane season. I do think the firearms thing is tied to politics, but the rest is tied to people's angst and feelings.   What happened during the most recent election? Prior to election, people were concerned that a Democrat would be elected so firearms sold better. Although during the Obama administration, firearms sold as well as they ever had.   Do people inquire about bunkers? Are more people setting up bunkers? I think there was a series of things that happened even a few years ago that led people in that direction more than now. I think there are people that are preppers, and that's a continual audience gaining speed. I mean, I couldn't answer as to what they're preparing for.   I think there are always more preppers. I'm not unhappy that it's always growing because I base a lot of my business on it, but I don't think it's indication of something. VICE: Who are your customers?  Joël Grimaldier: In France, we're leaders in the sale of survival materials and have been for the last ten years. Our clientele is linked to bushcraft and hiking, but our competitive edge is survivalism.  I'm also trying to develop the ""pure"" survivalist sector, and I'm attracting more and more francophone clients (from France, Belgium, and Switzerland) who are interested in this stuff. Even though survivalists tend to be discrete about their lifestyles and don't directly admit their interests, we can determine their habits through their purchases.  We've had a lot of competitors spring up in the last three or four years, who often do this to complement a main business like hunting or fishing.   Do you notice changes based on political climate? Do you sell more of certain products after certain events or elections?  Yes, for the past ten years, I've seen the survival market evolve. Initially, this was launched by shows like Bear Grylls's, but this whole ""surviving in nature"" period transformed into a more survivalist trend.  This practice isn't as developed in Europe as it is in North America, but it's starting to take off here. Some clients, without calling themselves survivalists, are still preparing for a variety of possible risks.   France is more affected by climate-related phenomena, and people are getting ready for that. The attacks we've seen in the last two years have also affected people's mentalities and pushed them toward preparation.  While political risks seem increasingly obvious in these parts, they're not considered ""major"" risks by the general population. Germany and Switzerland are encouraging their populations to set aside rations of food, but that's not a thing in France, at least not really.   The current electoral period hasn't affected sales here, at least not yet. And the growing tensions between Europe, the US, and Russia haven't yet had an impact on the ""base"" population.   Since I refuse to sell weapons, my clients generally buy long-term food rations and stock up on all the essentials they need in case of an evacuation.   VICE: How long have you been in business?  Niels Baartman: This is my sixth year in the business.    What kind of consumer trends have you seen in the past few years?  I'd say American politics influence us a lot more than Canadian politics. American politics are way more world-changing than Canadian politics will ever be, so I feel people tend to gravitate toward looking at the US policies that might dictate what might come down the pipe.   [During those periods], people will buy larger food packages, perhaps water containers, big tanks for emergency water. The food servings can be anywhere from one month to six months of supplies.   I think there's a greater awareness that being prepared is a wise thing to do, and I would say the key is finding good quality products that people can rely on.   What are people preparing for though? Everything under the sun. Natural disaster, some are for political reasons, road trips, ice storms. I would say it's all over the horizon; there is no specific reason.    What do you mean by ""political reasons?""  Whether it's foreign policy, or perhaps an economic meltdown, or whatever people in the prepper community are concerned about, a lot of it revolves around political decisions or the direction politics might be going. So many of them prepare for inevitable reasons that there might be a shortage of food or that something might affect the availability of funds or whatever the case may be.    What did you notice before and after Trump was elected? We definitely had a relatively strong reaction to preppers buying before Trump was elected, but after he was elected, that quieted down dramatically. People were feeling a sense of relief that the election was over, but also I think those who feared economic problems felt Trump might be beneficial. A lot of the prepper community has more right-wing viewpoints and so they thought Hillary would be disastrous.   What were they buying? Food. Our experience is that whenever there is something fearful out there, clients buy food because that's their main concern. Most preppers don't need other supplies because they're already stocked.    Do you sell bunkers supplies, and do people ask about bunkers?  No, and I don't find that has come up often in Canada. At least I haven't come across it much.

424,424,02-07-18 14:19,2018,7,2,Eric Johnson,How tech workers in the government could make everyone’s life easier: ‘Get rid of the paper’,"“We’re not doing anything with blockchain,” said Matt Cutts, the acting administrator of the U.S. Digital Service. For now, at least, the tech-focused division of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget is focused on the more basic ways that technology can make Americans’ interactions with the government user-friendly. “I am less worried about machine learning, I am less worried about artificial intelligence or the blockchain,” Cutts said on the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher. “I am more worried about the veteran who calls the VA every single day at 9 am.” Cutts, who spent nearly 17 years at Google before joining the USDS in 2017, said that’s not a rhetorical example. There really was a veteran, named Charles, who was calling every day to check in on the status of a disability claim appeal. “All we did was implement a progress bar so that he knows where he stands out of 100,000-plus veterans,” Cutts said. “So even though he knows he might have a two-and-a-half-year-plus wait, just knowing where you stand in that queue makes you heard and respected and valued.” He urged tech workers to consider a temporary tour of duty in the government because applying Silicon Valley’s “agile practices” to things like veterans’ benefits or Medicare can make a huge difference in people’s lives. And contrary to what some might expect, he said the USDS’ work has remained just as nonpartisan under President Trump as it was under President Obama. “There is so much good work to be done — high-impact work that can help a regular person get access to the sorts of government services that they need to have,” Cutts said. You can listen to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts. On the new podcast, Cutts did propose one big idea that could help everyone, both those working in government and everyday citizens: “Get rid of paper.” “I would be extremely ecstatic,” he said. “For example, H-1B visas. Millions of pieces of paper are shipped to a place, which then does a lottery, and ships all that paper back to the people who lost in the lottery. If you could just start with a preregistraton page that was digital ...” “We’re kind of used to seeing these pictures of supervisors’ offices with stacks and stacks up to the ceiling, which are unsearchable,” Cutts added. “Some people think they can do better by scanning or faxing stuff in, and then having an electronic version of that. The fact is, it needs to be digital-native from the beginning. That’s how it’s searchable, that’s how you can really check for errors.” If you like this show, you should also sample our other podcasts: If you like what we’re doing, please write a review on Apple Podcasts — and if you don’t, just tweet-strafe Kara.

426,426,12-02-18 11:00,2018,2,12,Kurt Wagner,Facebook lost around 2.8 million U.S. users under 25 last year. 2018 won’t be much better. ,"Facebook is losing young users even quicker than expected, according to new estimates by eMarketer. The digital measurement firm predicted last year that Facebook would see a 3.4 percent drop in 12- to 17-year-old users in the U.S. in 2017, the first time it had predicted a drop in usage for any age group on Facebook. The reality: The number of U.S. Facebook users in the 12- to 17-year-old demographic declined by 9.9 percent in 2017, eMarketer found, or about 1.4 million total users. That’s almost three times the decline expected. There were roughly 12.1 million U.S. Facebook users in the 12- to 17-year-old demographic by the end of the year. There are likely multiple reasons for the decline. Facebook has been losing its “cool” factor for years, and young people have more options than ever for staying in touch with friends and family. Facebook also serves as a digital record keeper — but many young people don’t seem to care about saving their life online, at least not publicly. That explains why Snapchat and Instagram, which offer features for sharing photos and videos that disappear, are growing in popularity among this demographic. Overall, eMarketer found Facebook lost about 2.8 million U.S. users under 25 last year. And Facebook’s 2018 doesn’t look much better. The research firm released Facebook usage estimates for 2018 on Monday, and expects that Facebook will lose about 2.1 million users in the U.S. under the age of 25 this year. EMarketer predicts that Facebook will see a decline in usage among all three age groups for people under 25: Take the numbers with a grain of salt — eMarketer is an outside research firm so it doesn’t have the full picture that, say, Facebook has. But the fact that eMarketer is predicting declines across the board is a bad sign for Facebook regardless. Young people offer a good barometer for what is popular, but more importantly for Facebook, losing out on the next generation of internet users in the U.S. is troubling for the company’s long-term dominance. The good news for Facebook is that, despite the expected decline in younger users, eMarketer believes Facebook’s overall U.S. audience will continue to grow for the next few years. More importantly, perhaps, eMarketer expects Facebook-owned Instagram to grow significantly. The research firm believes Instagram’s U.S. user base will grow by 13 percent this year, to almost 105 million people. That’s even better than Snapchat’s expected growth — eMarketer believes it will grow its U.S. audience by 9 percent in 2018. That would give Snapchat about 86.5 million users by the end of the year.

This restructuring has resulted in the layoffs of some 50 employees, at least some of which work in connection with Hirst’s various interests in the seaside town of Ilfracombe, Devon. This includes the popular Quay restaurant, where art tourists, drawn to the town by the 20-meter Hirst statue, “Verity,” could enjoy the catch of the day while looking at Hirst’s pickled fish, and other works. Though residents of Ilfracombe will surely bemoan any curtailing of tourist trade as a result of the closure, it seems that a handful of Hirst-owned properties have been standing vacant on the main strip for some time now, presenting an impediment to the doubtlessly otherwise bustling nature of the former maritime trade town with a population of 11,000 residents (according to a 2011 parish census). Last year, Hirst abandoned plans for the “Southern Extension,” a 750-unit development of eco-friendly homes on property owned by the artist, which also included a primary school and a health center. Maybe he scored an advance screener of Wild, Wild Country and realized cult leadership is not all it’s cracked up to be, no matter how many Rolls Royces you get to have. As a sort of consolation prize, Ilfracombe does get to keep Hirst’s giant bronze statue on the pier on long-term loan; when reached for comment, the town said, “Eh.” Of course, even after paring down his ambitions to no longer include annexing an entire town, Hirst’s humble return to his roots does include the purchase of a new studio on Beak Street in Soho, central London for a reported £40 million (~$52 million). Come on, guys — you cannot expect an artist to make paintings and pickle formerly living creatures and such without several multi-million dollar facilities. Hirst is showing real restraint here, possibly keeping his operations budget under £1 billion (~$1.3 billion); no doubt we can expect great revelations from this Siddhartha-like renunciation of his worldly holdings. If there’s one thing Hirst has demonstrated throughout a career based in conceptual market engagement, it’s that at the end of the day, he’s all about the art. Art, when reached for comment, reportedly said: “Hey Damien, no hard feelings — it’s totally cool with me if you want to stick with being a restaurateur, or whatever!”",https://hyperallergic.com/463473/damien-hirst-abandons-a-seaside-town-for-a-52-million-studio/,,Hyperallergic

430,430,13-01-16 15:30,2016,1,13,German Lopez,Obama's quiet push to ban LGBTQ discrimination in the workplace,"President Barack Obama's 2016 State of the Union speech didn't, as previous speeches did, land any firsts on LGBTQ issues. Obama didn't have any big moments like in 2012, when he became the first sitting president to support marriage equality, or in 2015, when he became the first president to say the word ""transgender"" in a State of the Union address. Instead, he focused on broad platforms, vaguely advocating for equality. But his administration may be on the verge of having the most direct impact it's ever had on LGBTQ equality — by potentially fostering a legal challenge that will lead to a federal ban on discrimination in the workplace and housing. In the US, most states' civil rights laws don't ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, or public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the general public). As a result, more than half of LGBTQ Americans, according to the advocacy group Movement Advancement Project, live in a state where, under state law, an employer can legally fire someone because he's gay, a landlord can legally evict someone because she's lesbian, and a hotel manager can legally deny service to someone who's transgender — for no reason other than the person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Banning this type of discrimination has long been a goal of LGBTQ advocates, through the push for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. But the ban is closer than ever to happening as the Obama administration, quietly but surely, helps along a new legal interpretation of decades-old laws. Advocates have long argued that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act should protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace and housing, as they do for race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. It's the last protection — sex — that's relevant here: Advocates say that protections against sex-based discrimination also apply to sexual orientation and gender identity, since discrimination against LGBTQ people is, fundamentally, rooted in expectations of what people of certain sexes should be like. (One caveat: These protections would not apply to public accommodations, since sex isn't covered in federal laws for that area.) ""It's pretty uncontroversial that discriminating against a man that acts too effeminate or a woman that acts too masculine is a form of sex discrimination,"" the ACLU's Joshua Block previously told me. ""That applies to lesbians and gay men, too."" Advocates have long argued that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act should protect LGBTQ people The federal government, under Obama, has quietly come around to this interpretation of the Civil Rights Act. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), whose five-person commission is made up of four Obama appointees, in 2012 agreed that the Civil Rights Act protects people from discrimination based on gender identity. In 2015, it expanded the protections to sexual orientation. The US Department of Justice has similarly stated that it believes federal civil rights protections apply to gender identity, although it has yet to say the same about sexual orientation. But since EEOC is seen as an expert advisory for other federal agencies on employment issues, it's possible the Justice Department's position could change soon. (LGBTQ advocates certainly hope so; they've been pushing the Justice Department to change its stance for years.) Why does all of this matter? Essentially, this is fostering the beginning of a big court challenge over the Civil Rights Act's reach — one that could end up at the US Supreme Court. And if that were to happen, and the Supreme Court ruled once again in favor of LGBTQ rights, it would likely be a result of support not just from LGBTQ advocates, but also from the EEOC and the Justice Department, both of which are federal agencies that are respected by the courts. Notably, this court challenge could take a while to work up to the Supreme Court, likely until after Obama is out of office. But by planting the seeds to this challenge through his appointees to the EEOC and, possibly, a change in the Justice Department's stated legal opinion in this area, Obama and his administration could lead to yet another huge impact on LGBTQ rights.",https://www.vox.com/2016/1/13/10760268/obama-gay-lgbtq-workplace,,Vox

433,433,22-05-19 17:24,2019,5,22,Adam Woodhead,How Hippies Turned a Ann Arbor into 'The Dope Capital of the Midwest'," For four months starting in the fall of 1966, the pair had befriended members of the Trans-Love Energies collective, located at the Detroit Artists’ Workshop near Wayne State University. The building was a center of left-wing activism and agitational propaganda in the Motor City—home of the Fifth Estate newspaper, the local office of the Committee to End the War in Vietnam, and the future rehearsal space for revolutionary rock band the MC5. On January 24, 1967, police raided the building, looking for the property manager John Sinclair. “Peg,” to whom Sinclair had gifted two joints, was actually a Detroit Police officer named Jane Mumford Lovelace. “Louis” was not a candle maker, but her fellow cop Vahan Kapagian, who had grown his hair and beard out to blend in.  Police made more than 50 arrests, including Sinclair’s wife Leni, but Sinclair was the only one who faced serious charges after being let out on bail. A beat poet and obsessive of black jazz culture as well as a lefty agitator, Sinclair had attracted attention from the Detroit Police “Red Squad,” which monitored left-wing groups. But in their attempt to take him down, which spawned a years-long legal battle, the cops helped turn him into an extremely of-his-time icon.  Today, legalization is regarded as a mainstream position, with even right-wing politicians like John Boehner supporting the movement and joining the large multi-state operators now maneuvering to control the cannabis industry. Sinclair and his contemporaries helped create the conditions for that industry to exist, but they aren’t the ones best poised to profit off of it. One of Sinclair’s radical contemporaries, former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers—who roomed with Sinclair’s fellow White Panther Milton “Skip” Taube at the University of Michigan—doesn’t think that Boehner should be able to jump to the front of the line.  “You know I heard an interview on the radio where they kept asking him, ‘Aren’t you sorry that a lot of people went to jail and lives were broken?’ He said, ‘No, because that’s the way I understood it then.’ Well that’s bullshit,” Ayers told VICE. “Legalizing marijuana needs to be part of something bigger. It has to include reparations, and that means accountability for the people that brought us to the catastrophic place we were. People like John Boehner.”  But Sinclair sees his side as having achieved victory in spite of those people. “They hate marijuana smokers. They used to put us in prison. Now the bulk of the population supports us, but they still haven’t adjusted to that. Pretty soon you won’t be able to get elected if you don’t support marijuana legalization,” the 77-year-old said. “It’s very satisfying to see the tables turned on these rotten, lying motherfuckers. All this horrible police state shit. It’s the fabric of daily life in America that we’ve got to rip apart and dispense of. That’s going to be the hard part, is picking this shit out of the culture and throwing it away.”  The pro-weed activists of Sinclair’s era won an important victory: Cannabis legalization has swept through all regions of the country at this point. But their story also shows how difficult lasting change can be.  But the strident anti-authoritarianism of the Detroit Artists Workshop—someone hung a banner out of the window during the infamous 1967 riots reading “Burn Baby Burn”—led to what activists described as harassment from the police, and violence from those with anti-hippie sentiments. After a firebomb attack on the MC5 bus and a series of assaults on women in the group, Trans-Love Energies relocated to a house on Hill Street in Ann Arbor, near the University of Michigan.   It was there that John and Leni Sinclair left what was arguably their most enduring legacy, as part of a group of agitators who pushed the college town to adopt the most progressive pot policies in the country, making Ann Arbor, as the  New York Times put it years later, “the Dope Capital of the Midwest.” There, Trans-Love dreamed of building a revolutionary enclave like the Maoist cadres they admired. Unlike Detroit, Sinclair says now, the cops weren’t going to bust down too many doors. And crucially, it was largely white.  “In Ann Arbor it was all the children of rich people,” Sinclair said. “The police were really precisely geared to not cause trouble for them. They were going to have to be lawyers, and doctors, and shit. So we took advantage of that. That’s why we went there. Because they only had ten police cars.”  Like campuses across the country, Ann Arbor in 1968 was teeming with radical youth, but something in the Trans-Love formula was especially compelling. In the MC5, the collective found a bridge between their leftist ideology, Sinclair’s Beatnik reefer worship, and the emerging blue-collar rock scene in Detroit. The band would play to a young, suburban audience at Detroit’s Grande Ballroom, then return home to Ann Arbor to do free outdoor concerts. As the band’s manager, Sinclair arranged for the MC5 to perform outside of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that August. They returned to form the White Panther Party—named after the Black Panther Party—and called in their ten-point program for revolution through “rock 'n’ roll, dope, and fucking in the streets.”  The group even established a nonprofit ecclesiastical wing, the Church of Zenta, based around ritual use of weed and hallucinogens. “Zenta is the religion to end all religions,” Leni Sinclair said. “That’s how I look at it. Because it’s the only religion that says ‘yes’ where other religions say ‘no’ or ‘thou shalt not.’ Well hippies say ‘yes.’ Yes, smoke weed. Have sex. Be who you are... Anybody who smokes weed is a Zenta believer, whether they know the term or not.""  In 1969, White Panther leaders, including Sinclair, were indicted on conspiracy charges related to a string of bombings in Ann Arbor targeting buildings associated with the military and CIA. FBI Section Chief R.L. Shackelford called the White Panthers “potentially the largest and most dangerous of revolutionary organizations in the United States,” and the group was targeted for surveillance under the agency’s COINTELPRO program. (The bombing case would go all the way to the US Supreme Court, which ruled that the government had illegally wiretapped the WPP; the charges were subsequently dropped.)  But the thing that drew the most controversy was Sinclair’s sentence, handed down in July 1969, for those two joints he gave the undercover cop: ten years in prison.   The disproportionate penalty made him a cause celebre, with leading figures on the left—from Black Panther Party founder Bobby Seale to John Lennon—coming to his defense. At the John Sinclair Freedom Rally in 1971, Lennon and Yoko Ono performed a new tune, “John Sinclair,” that distilled the case to a sound bite: “They gave him ten for two—what more can the bastards do?”   Days later, Sinclair was released on bond and his conviction was overturned the next year, when the Michigan Supreme Court declared the state’s cannabis laws unconstitutional. The landmark case reduced the penalty for “simple possession” to a misdemeanor, and brought the maximum sentence down from ten years to one. The maximum sentence for sale of pot was reduced from life to four years. On April 1, when the new regime came into effect, Sinclair’s supporters gathered on Ann Arbor campus to celebrate his victory. The party has been held every year since, in what is now known as the Ann Arbor Hash Bash festival.  “The atmosphere after John got out of jail was one of great expectations for the future,” Leni Sinclair said. “We were on the national stage and had pulled off a very successful John Sinclair Freedom Rally. That is, until the government stepped in and ordered John Lennon and Yoko Ono to be deported, and they had to break off all political activity. But until then it was a feeling of euphoria, of things are going to get better from now on.”  After John's release from prison, the Sinclairs became less combative, re-christening the White Panthers the Rainbow People’s Party (RPP) and getting involved in electoral politics. Forming a coalition with the progressive Human Rights Party, the group won two seats on the Ann Arbor City Council. The  New York Times noted the willingness of the new coalition to run against the local Democratic Party, rather than solicit its support, and attributed their success to grassroots campaigning and the ability to reach University of Michigan students. The new council members were Jerry DeGrieck, a student himself, and Nancy Wechsler, a central committee member of the Rainbow People’s Party. Both Degrieck and Wechsler assumed office at just 22 years old, and would later come out, making them two of the first openly gay elected officials in American history.  The most radical thing the new council members did was pass a law reducing the penalty for cannabis possession to a mere $5, about $30 in today’s money. The  Times reported that campaigners had originally proposed a 25-cent fine, but compromised at $5 to cover administrative and court costs. Michigan State Police Director John Plants told the paper he would enforce state law in Ann Arbor, citing fears that the new law could transform surrounding Washtenaw County into a haven for drug trafficking. But the hippies celebrated.  “Because of state law, we couldn’t make marijuana legal within the city,” DeGrieck said. “So we did the next best thing.”  This made the city one of the first to treat possession as a civil infraction, like a parking violation. It marked a major shift across the country, and within a year Oregon moved to adopt a similar law at the state level. Coverage of Ann Arbor in the  Times focused on the open consumption trend, with Sheriff Frederick Postill describing more stringent state laws as “unenforceable” owing to the prevalence of weed use in the city. which Police Chief Walter Krasny estimated at 1,000 pounds per week in 1972. “I guess, unfortunately, marijuana is becoming a part of our way of life,” Kransy told the  Times.   Sinclair served as chairman of the RPP, helping broker alliances with more moderate elements of the coalition, and found consensus around the $5 pot law, which the group saw as a challenge to the power of the county sheriff department. But when moderates within the HRP expressed reservations about taking on the sheriff in local elections, Sinclair led the Rainbow People’s exit from the group, a move he now says he regrets.   But for a time, Ann Arbor really was something of a hippie sanctuary. A system of parallel power structures grew out of Trans-Love commune, including a security force, a drug counseling service, and a vast alternative media network which printed pro-cannabis propaganda like Sinclair’s “Marijuana Revolution,” which argued that drug prohibition had become one of the contradictions of capitalist society in the West, paving the way for post-scarcity communism.   “If the Democrats and Human Rights Party were in coalition we could pass anything, and we did,” Leni Sinclair said. “We appropriated money for a daycare center, a free clinic, a dental clinic, runaway children, a food coop, and for a community center, the People’s Ballroom. It was like utopia for a minute.”  At one point,  Ann Arbor Sun advertised a mail-in contest where readers could win a pound of cannabis. The prize was presented by state representative and Democratic Socialists of America member Perry Bullard.   “We lit a fire in Ann Arbor that lasted for a few years,” John said. “and made it a lot of fun.”  Republicans took back control of the city council in 1973, and pushed through a repeal of the $5 law. That didn’t end the battle, however. At a council hearing in July, the Rainbow People swarmed the meeting, lighting joints in the council chambers. The following year, their Human Rights Party coalition brought the $5 pot law back as a ballot measure to amend the city charter. Ann Arbor voted to approve the measure in April of 1974, by a margin of 52-48. The law stayed in place until 1990, when the fine was raised to $25.   Michigan voters finally approved recreational pot in 2018, but it’s no longer regarded as a symbol of revolution. Instead, some now worry the cannabis industry is dominated by large companies and white men. Canadian firm Acreage holdings, whose executive board includes Boehner, has made a series of multimillion-dollar investments in Michigan, and in April, the state legislature passed a bill making it easier for large companies to acquire commercial licenses by limiting background checks on investors. In states like Massachusetts, which legalized cannabis in 2016, multi-state operators have managed to skirt regulations and position themselves to effectively control the emerging market.  Cannabis has gone from being a sacrament in John Sinclair’s eyes to a medicine under the law to a valuable commodity, if one with sometimes uncertain legal status. One sign of the changing times is the effort to eliminate provisions of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program which allow patients to sign their rights to grow up to 12 plants over to a caregiver, who can possess up to 72 plants in total. Those who want to end the system say medical pot too often ends on the black market, and on May 2, they scored a major victory when a state regulator decided that caregivers could no longer sell their product to dispensaries. But that program also provides patients like Sinclair direct access to affordable weed—he currently receives two free ounces per month—and he sees the plan to end it as a hostile takeover.   “They’re opposed to this law that the people enacted. So they try everything they can to fuck it up by getting rid of the caregivers,” Sinclair said. “It’s not only their goal but the goal of the big-time suppliers, and growers, and distributors that pay for the $150,000 licenses. They want to get rid of the caregivers because they’re competition. If you can’t get it from a caregiver you have to get it from them.”  Sinclair himself says has never made any real money from weed, despite lending his name to various cannabis businesses over the years. After the new law came into effect in 2018, it was widely reported that Sinclair had partnered with a Detroit business to create Michigan’s first public lounge for recreational smokers. The deal soon fell apart, amid what Sinclair said was an attempt by the building’s owners to exploit his status as a cannabis celebrity. He currently survives on Social Security, and is in the process of signing all intellectual property rights over to the Amsterdam-based John Sinclair Foundation. “It’s in formation,” Sinclair said. “I’m trying to form a creative repository for everything I own, so that it will go down into history.”   Maintaining a firm grip on these rights is one of the ways icons like Tommy Chong and Willie Nelson have been able to cash in on their stoner status, launching their own lines of strains, glass pipes, and vape pens. But Sinclair seems to have no interest in capitalizing on legalization, even though his activism helped the country get here. After all these years, he professes not to care about money and property. “I don’t care anything about the industry,” he said. “I have no stake in the industry. I don’t care what they do. I just wanna get the weed.” Adam Woodhead is a freelance journalist from Detroit.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43jnk9/how-hippies-turned-a-college-town-into-the-dope-capital-of-the-midwest,Drugs,Vice

Huawei currently sells 500,000 to 600,000 smartphones a day, he said in a speech at the CES Asia technology show in Shanghai.  The comments come after the United States put Huawei on a blacklist last month that barred it from doing business with U.S. companies on security grounds without government approval, prompting some global tech companies to cut ties with the world’s largest telecommunication equipment maker.  The company in January said it could become the world’s biggest-selling smartphone vendor this year even without the U.S. market. It was the second-biggest vendor in the first quarter, behind South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.  Analysts estimate the recent U.S. sanctions could push Huawei’s smartphone shipments down as much as a quarter this year and cause its handsets to disappear from overseas markets.

A lawsuit alleging price-fixing of generic drugs is about to be expanded to include nearly every state in the country, and one company — Mylan — is already feeling the heat. Forty-six state attorneys general are alleging price fixing of generic drugs by 18 companies. The drugs range from anxiety medications to diabetes treatments, to antibiotics. Generic drugs are meant to come in at a lower price than the original branded version that are no longer protected by patents, cutting prescription drug costs for consumers because any number of companies can now make the drug. ""We allege in this complaint that the defendant companies' collusion was so pervasive that it essentially eliminated competition from the market for these 15 drugs in its entirety,"" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a statement. ""Our ongoing investigation continues to uncover additional evidence, and we anticipate bringing more claims involving additional companies and drugs at the appropriate time."" That's up from the 20 state attorneys who sued 6 companies, including Mylan, alleging the generic drugmakers colluded on prices. The drugs in question at the time were a generic antibiotic called doxycycline hyclate and an antidiabetic medication called glyburide. The states are zeroing in on a man named Rajiv Malik, Mylan's president and executive director, along with Satish Mehta, CEO at Emcure Pharmaceuticals. Mylan's shares are down more than 8% on the news. Mylan said in a statement: ""We have been investigating these allegations thoroughly and have found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees. Our review of the Connecticut Attorney General's press release underpinning the complaint does not change our views. We have asked the various attorneys general leading this case to share with us what information they believe supports these new allegations and, to date, they have not done so. Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its President, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully. Mylan and Rajiv Malik both intend to defend this case vigorously, and we look forward to the opportunity to present a full defense.""

Under the rescue plan, an independent panel would erase some of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt load that has crippled the island state already facing a 45 percent poverty rate and the Zika epidemic.  U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, has endorsed the fix and the fate of the measure could help define his tenure as party leader which began in October.  But Ryan can rely on some Democrats who say the rescue will aid the ailing island even if some of the legislation’s provisions are too punitive of Puerto Rico.  “This is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva, the leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.  Grijalva of Arizona said he expects lawmakers will ratify the plan when they write the fine-print of the legislation at a hearing on Wednesday.  Rep. Rob Bishop, the panel’s chairman, postponed a law-writing session in April because of opposition to the Puerto Rico rescue but on Tuesday he said he was hopeful.  Ryan and Democratic leaders stress the aid plan for the  island means relief without federal spending though investors will see a cut in their Puerto Rican bond holdings and they are fighting for terms that could limit the hit to their portfolios.  A leading voice for investors, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on Tuesday backed the plan which expects Puerto Rico to control deficit spending.  A Puerto Rico oversight panel, or control board, could veto Puerto Rico spending measures that it finds irresponsible and SIFMA endorsed such “broad powers to enforce and monitor fiscal discipline.”  The oversight board would have the power to push creditors to accept a write-down of debt, even over the objections of holdout investors.  The plan would also ask the oversight board to protect the interests of Puerto Rico pensioners who rely on a system that is now under funded by at least $40 billion.   Reporting By Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan and Patrick Rucker; Editing by Bernard Orr",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-congress/lawmakers-see-path-ahead-for-puerto-rico-rescue-plan-idUSKCN0YF30C,Politics,Reuters
437,437,06-02-19 19:00,2019,2,6,Becky Ferreira,"Honeybees Can Add and Subtract, Study Finds","Honeybees can perform mathematical calculations such as addition and subtraction, according to a study published Wednesday in  Science Advances.  A team led by Scarlett Howard, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toulouse who goes by the handle “the beesearcher” on Twitter, devised an experiment that demonstrated that these insects could recognize gains and losses.  “Given that honeybees and humans are separated by over 400 million years of evolution, our findings suggest that advanced numerical cognition may be more accessible to nonhuman animals than previously suspected,” said the authors.  So how do you give honeybees a math test?  Howard’s team conditioned 14 bees to associate the color blue with addition and yellow with subtraction. This was done with an appetitive-aversive (reward-punishment) method, meaning the bees received a sugary food reward when they selected the right color and a bitter-tasting quinine liquid when they were incorrect.  The bees were exposed to an initial sample that displayed one to five shapes in either blue or yellow. They were then were trained fly into a “decision chamber” that contained two different display options. The bees were expected to recognize greater quantities in blue addition trials and smaller quantities in yellow subtraction trials.  In the addition trials, one of the two blue displays contained one more shape than the initial sample—the correct answer. The other display showed a number that was equal to or fewer than the starting sample.  For instance, say the bee first looked at a sample that had two blue shapes printed on it. Once it was in the decision chamber, it might be met with one display with three blue shapes while the other had one blue shape. The reverse was true for the subtraction trials. The bees became progressively better at the test and selected the correct answer 60 to 75 percent of the time, over 100 trials. The fact that the bees were able to learn how to complete these puzzles adds to the previous evidence that they are capable of grasping advanced numerical concepts. Last year, Howard and her colleagues at RMIT University published similar research, suggesting that honeybees understand the concept of zero. That experiment trained bees to select placards with lower quantities printed on them. When a blank placard was introduced, the bees understood that zero was less than one with 80 percent accuracy. These math skills may have been an important factor in the extraordinary evolutionary success of honeybees around the world. “While the specific task of addition/subtraction may not be directly apparent in the honeybee’s natural environment, the skills and cognitive plasticity required for performing the arithmetic task are likely to be ecologically advantageous,” Howard and her colleagues said in the study.  For instance, they suggest that bees might be able to numerically assess what flower geometries provide the best resources. The researchers plan to continue giving bees more complicated math quizzes to further explore the range of their computational skills.

According to the judge's order, Lutz had received several items over her two-decade-long relationship with Madonna, and when they ended things Darlene got to keep some stuff.

442,442,27-06-16 16:25,2016,6,27,James Butler,What's Next for the UK After Brexit,"It happened. Much of Britain wishes it hadn't, and as the despairing hangover begins to recede, we will need to figure out what to do about it.  There are three certainties about Brexit:  One—that it is the biggest political crisis in Britain in 60 years.  Two—that the changes it could force in the makeup of the British state and political system will be huge.  Three—it highlights how utterly dysfunctional our current politics is, how divided and broken the country is. Meanwhile, Europe—the scapegoat for so many—is now gone.  Think of the Brexiteer politician who told Sky News that no, actually, there was nothing behind the curtain—that ""there is no plan."" Think of Nigel Farage basking in his 4 AM victory, declaring ""we won it without a bullet being fired"" just ten days after a center-left MP was murdered by a committed fascist. Think of David Cameron jacking it all in, abandoning his post after losing the referendum he called to protect his own career. We are entering turbulent times, with nobody at the wheel.  Though there have been desperate moves among some Remainers to find a way to nullify the referendum—to hold a second one, or just ignore it, or hope that the Scottish parliament will block it using some obscure constitutional wizardry—this would be a mistake. It would give the hard right a foundation myth of staggering power: the democratic will of the people overridden by a decadent cosmopolitan elite, who need purging from public life. It certainly beats burning down the Reichstag.  Beyond being a gift to the very frothiest of racists, though, to press for a second referendum ignores one of the key dynamics of the campaign: an anti-elitist sentiment capitalized on by the Leavers. The bedrock of this was a sense that those in power do not listen and will bludgeon the electorate until they get their own way. It is true that referendums on the EU have been re-run before, in Ireland and Denmark, or ignored, as in France or Greece. But that comes with a cost: it undermines any claim the EU might try to make about its often rather tenuous democracy, and confirms every suspicion ""no"" voters have about distant technocrats and sham consultations. No: the vote is done. We must work with things as they are.  How are they, then? Not good.  The immediate economic impacts are obvious: the pound fell off a cliff, a sudden decline in foreign direct investment, international restructuring to move jobs elsewhere. It's hard to weep for a JP Morgan executive, but we're not just talking bankers: Britain's service-heavy economy makes it heavily exposed outside the EU, and there's little hope in concluding a simple deal on trade in services at any speed. In the medium term, another recession seems likely, as well as a ""Brexit budget"" to institute austerity of a kind undreamt of by the old coalition. The political ramifications are even less cheery. The Tories are in disarray, and it looks probable that Boris Johnson—a man who conspired to beat up a journalist, and was fired from the Times and a front bench position for lying—will ride an even bigger lie into Number ten.  The Parliamentary Labour Party, seeing an opportunity with the Tories divided, has decided to gather itself into a circular firing squad. Corbyn, the only major politician to have refused to pander to xenophobia during the campaign, faces an attempted coup by MPs who have failed to learn that trying to ape racists only strengthens racists, and makes you look either cynical or clueless. You'd think that a party that printed up mugs emblazoned with promises to reduce immigration, before losing a general election anyway, might have learned this.  If the state of parliamentary politics makes you despair, the widely reported rise in casual street racism and spike in racist attacks, sanctioned by a feverish Brexit atmosphere, might well make you fear. The effects of a vote aren't just in parliament, but in the fabric of our daily lives, too.  The implications of Brexit are staggering for the workings of government, too. It seems likely that Whitehall will for years be caught up in extricating British law from EU law. Having shrunk by a fifth and with many departmental budgets slashed, it's almost certain that it will take up most of the civil service's attention. So extensive is the amount of regulation needing review and reform, and so constrained the timescale in which it will need doing, it's easy to imagine that the government will essentially be handed a rubber stamp for its chosen direction. It is certainly possible that Scotland will leave the UK—a possibility only hamstrung by the likelihood the EU would expect it to adopt the Euro, and the disinclination of Spain to make it easy for a small secessionist state to prosper. It also seems likely that political turbulence in Ireland will increase. And in the face of all this: there is no plan.  Early intimations from the Leave camp are that they hope to negotiate membership of the European Economic Area (the market part of the EU)—the ""Norway"" model—but with restrictions on freedom of movement and freedom to pick and choose from European law. This will not happen. Free movement and acceptance of EU regulations are preconditions of EEA membership.  If EEA membership does happen, it will exacerbate political tension. It would mean keeping freedom of movement, which would see the anti-migrant voters crying betrayal. Traditional party votes in the Brexit heartlands would collapse and new UKIP MPs would get elected. It would also probably signal the end of the Labour Party as it currently exists. This is comparatively benign; its more malignant expressions are much darker.  This is the culmination of a longer story. For 30 years, media and politicians have scapegoated both Europe and migrants as catch-all explanations for why people's lives are blighted and hopeless. We've had reliance on a boom led by the South East, very limited redistribution elsewhere and no substantial fix to the gutted industrial landscape. That—and the ever-growing distance between the political class and the electorate—has led to an explosive situation without clear resolution.  In the referendum campaign, the Leavers filled that gap with the kind of lies that are seductive because they promise a very simple world, with very simple fixes. Everyone else is just out for themselves—for instance, the ""experts"" Gove derided for supposedly pulling the wool over people's eyes. Certainly, some experts are easy to hate, but when those lies unravel, as they very quickly have done, they will leave an even wider and more bitter gap. That is why Boris Johnson is not a clown, or a jester, or light relief: Boris Johnson is a cancer in public life.  No immediate political solution seems obvious. Any plan relying on a general election will have to overcome the new Fixed-term Parliaments Act and then actually win the contest. Both are mammoth tasks, and Labour's coffers are depleted.  It is certainly necessary for anyone who wants to resist the rightward drift on migration to defend Corbyn's leadership: he has acted as the only bulwark against migrant-bashing in Parliament. Movements outside Westminster in solidarity with migrants will require more active involvement from those disturbed by the racist drift of our politics. But that is fire-fighting—necessary to prevent total ruin of our house, but not enough to rebuild it.  Despite the chaos, we must also think in wider terms. The larger task is to survey the changing geography of British politics and look squarely at the failure of the left in this country. Not only the failure to defend the economic fabric of our common life—secure pay, good housing, accessible education—but its political expression.  If the Leavers have profited on anti-political feeling, the only possible solution is to find some way of remaking politics so that the specters of fear and insecurity, and disdain for a distant political class, no longer animate so much of the electorate. That requires us to remake our democracy as well. It is a gargantuan task, but it may well be the only thing that can defang the vipers now at the heart of our politics.

There was no issue whatsoever.” At other times, Kavanaugh's public appearances have been met with outright celebration.  Earlier this month, Kavanaugh received a standing ovation from the audience at the Federalist Society's annual convention in DC. And when he attended a homecoming football game at Georgetown Preparatory Academy, at which many of the allegations against him centered, Kavanaugh was reportedly lauded as a ""hero,"" according to the Post, posing for photos and mingling with his fellow alums.  The ease with which Kavanaugh has apparently been able to slip back into the routines of his life is a stark contrast to reports of Ford's life post-Senate Judiciary hearings.

""Her family has been through a lot. They are not living at home. It's going to be quite some time before they're able to live at home.""

Ford wrote that she'd used some of the more than $647,000 in donations to pay for security detail, a home security service, and to subsidize temporary housing during the time she's been displaced.  Ford said she'd be closing the fund and donating additional funds to organizations that support survivors of sexual trauma. “Your tremendous outpouring of support and kind letters have made it possible for us to cope with the immeasurable stress, particularly the disruption to our safety and privacy,” Ford wrote. “Because of your support, I feel hopeful that our lives will return to normal.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xy4xe/brett-kavanaugh-basketball-coach-christine-blasey-ford,Identity,Vice
445,445,26-06-19 00:00,2019,6,26,David Shepardson,White House plans new social media summit as Congress raises questions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House announced on Wednesday it will hold a summit on social media next month amid growing criticism from President Donald Trump and some in Congress.  The White House did not say who would take part in the July 11 gathering and major social media firms did not immediately confirm they would attend. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the meeting would “bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment.”  U.S. politicians, led by Trump, have increasingly used social media to try to go around traditional media and woo voters directly via social media platforms. Trump has said on many occasions that he would have been elected without Twitter and Facebook.   Trump, who has more than 61 million Twitter followers, on Wednesday renewed his regular attacks on Twitter suggesting without offering evidence in a Fox Business Network interview that Twitter makes it “very hard for people to join me at Twitter ... and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.  “Twitter is just terrible what they do.”  Twitter did not immediately comment while Facebook declined to comment on the summit Wednesday. Alphabet Inc’s Google unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  At a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing Wednesday, executives from the three major social media firms face questioned about efforts to remove extremist content and alleged political bias  Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who chairs the committee, cited the live-streaming of an attack that killed 51 people and wounded 49 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Facebook and said social media companies need to do more to prevent such content “from spreading on your platforms again.” He said they must also do a better job keeping “hate  speech and harmful misinformation off their platforms.”  In April, Trump met with Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and spent a significant time questioning him about why he had lost some Twitter followers, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.  The source said Dorsey explained in response to Trump’s concerns about losing followers that the company was working to remove fraudulent and spam accounts and that many famous people, including Dorsey himself, had diminished followings as a result.  Trump again complained on Wednesday he was not gaining followers as quickly as he previously did. Trump lost 204,000 of his 53.4 million followers in July 2018, according to social media data firm Keyhole, when Twitter started purging suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections.  Trump has one of the most-followed accounts on Twitter. But the president and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly criticized the company and its social media competitors for what they have called bias against conservatives, something Twitter denies.

Her decades-old call for putting an end to war and giving peace a chance has become more timely than ever. Now, against the current backdrop of out-of-control hostility, destruction of nature, political lies and chicanery, repression of human rights, and corruption without impunity of all kinds, Ono has emerged with Warzone (Chimera Music), her newest musical project. Executed over a short period of time this past summer, Warzone features dramatically reworked versions of some of the artist-composer’s own songs from her past albums. Produced in collaboration with the young American keyboardist Thomas Bartlett (who usually performs as “Doveman”), Ono’s Warzone comes as a somewhat unexpected missive from this grandmother and modern-art doyenne, whose roof-busting scream in “Why” on her debut album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970), announced a radical fusion of the avant-garde and rock, and whose inventive use of mass media and celebrity helped create new delivery methods for conceptual art. “It feels like we’re all living in a warzone today,” Ono told me during a recent interview at her home in the Dakota, the hulking apartment building in uptown Manhattan, where she and John Lennon settled in the 1970s. She explained that, a few months ago, acting quickly on an impulse in response to an inundation of ugly, dispiriting news, she combed through her large body of recorded music and selected a batch of songs whose themes and messages still sound urgent right now. Ono, who was concerned about her voice after recovering from flu-like symptoms that slowed her down in 2016, said, “At first I thought I would wait until next year, but then, every day in the newspaper, it’s this and that — and I thought, ‘Are you kidding? I’m not going to wait.’” In enlisting Bartlett, who is known for his stripped-down interpretations that reveal the essence of other songwriters’ compositions (material as diverse as David Bowie’s “Lazarus” or the soundtrack of the 1984 film Footloose), Ono found a collaborator who instinctively cut some fat from her original recordings to expose her songs’ structures and showcase their melodies. Bartlett also gently calls attention to the distinctive character of her songs, which sometimes feature quirky chord changes or phrases. (“I’m just living on tiptoe, feeling like so-so,” she sings in “It’s Gonna Rain.”) Ono said, “I knew about Tom, who had done a few of my songs before, and I knew his sensibility.” She decided that assembling a conventional backing band “was not the way to go” this time and recalled, “I said to Tom, ‘You and I are going to make this record — along with the animals.’” The sounds of elephants honking, monkeys screeching, and other beasts cooing, whining, and wailing open and close the album, and punctuate various passages of Warzone’s songs. Ono said, “Animals are musicians, too.” Warzone revisits songs from such Ono albums as Approximately Infinite Universe (1973), Feeling the Space (1973), Starpeace (1985), and Rising (1995). From Approximately, “Now or Never” is an unabashedly political song, originally performed in a folk-music style and first released when the Vietnam War had become an ever more costly, desperate, aimless mission. Dismissed by some critics at the time as both idealistic and naive in its message, in the face of the Trump fascists’ destruction of democracy, its lyrics could not be more timely. Now delicately propelled on gusts of synthesizer and the gurgle of an electric piano, in Warzone’s version of “Now or Never,” Ono sings: Are we gonna keep pretending things are alright? Are we gonna keep our mouths closed just in case? Are we gonna keep putting off until it’s too late? Are we gonna be known as the century of fear? Isolating the electric-guitar riff that anchors Ono’s feminist anthem “Woman Power,” from Feeling the Space, Bartlett pushes her voice forward in the mix; here, she declaims as much as she sings, like an older woman, mother, and observer of human foibles who has witnessed a lifetime of power plays by macho men and beer-soaked bromancers: Every woman has a song to sing. Every woman has a story to tell. And make no mistake about it, brothers, We women have the power to move the mountains! For such songs as “I Love All of Me,” an empowerment anthem for the bullied, overlooked, and powerless; “Children Power,” a jaunty march whose all-embracing spirit offers a lift for little ones from the playground to the boardroom; and “It’s Gonna Rain,” in which Ono, with little-girl glee, runs outside into a drenching downpour, Bartlett peels away the drum machines and bombast of their original 1980s versions. Such new arrangements give Warzone the feeling of an intimate recital, with Ono and Bartlett capturing the essence of each song in one or two takes, and only minimal layering-on of additional instruments, effects, or vocals — children’s voices, animal sounds, or the replicated sound of machine-gun fire. Into the overall mix Ono drops her familiar yelps, gulps, chortles, whoops, yodel-like cries, and full-throttled caterwauls, providing remarkably appropriate textures to several songs’ new settings. Her detractors will never like — or understand — her music, and that, she knows, is okay. However, for numerous alternative-rock acts, there are lessons to be derived from her take-no-prisoners candor and unflagging experimentation. Listen, for example, to “Gold Rush,” from Death Cab for Cutie’s recently released Thank You for Today, which samples the underlying riff from Ono’s funk-romp “Mindtrain,” from her 1971 album Fly. Or “This Cities Undone,” from Moonlandingz’s debut album Interplanetary Class Classics (2017), in which Ono cries “Wake up!” and “Get on with it!” throughout a spaced-out sonic ride. Then there is the British DJ-producer Hifi Sean’s “In Love with Life,”   from his 2016 album Ft., which features Ono lamenting, over a fluid-seductive, inescapably danceable groove, humanity’s tendency for self-destruction. “It saddens me, because I am really in love with life — and with people,” she observes. “They’re beautiful.” Such humanistic strains have long been present in Ono’s art. Today, the spirit of the written, kōan-like instruction pieces she produced early in her career has given way to the nuggets of wisdom or well-meaning provocation Ono telegraphs via Twitter to the world. “Healing yourself is connected with healing others,” a recent tweet advised. Another observed, “Music is in all our blood. Some of us just haven’t discovered that yet. For someone who ostensibly has been lying low, Ono is lately everywhere. Along with granting younger music-makers avant-garde cred through guest appearances on their records or samplings from her own recordings, Ono last year was recognized by the National Music Publishers’ Association in the US as the co-author, with John Lennon, of the song “Imagine.” (In a 1980 BBC interview, Lennon had said, “That should be credited as a Lennon-Ono song because a lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from Yoko.”) Now, Imagine John Yoko (Grand Central Publishing), a new book chronicling the creation of Lennon’s Imagine album and its now-classic title song, has just come out. Ono compiled its never-before-published selection of photos and documents from the Lennons’ archive and sought recollections from the musicians who played on the record, whose production began at their Georgian-style mansion near London, in 1971. The book illuminates the breadth of Lennon and Ono’s exchange of ideas and influences in the early years of their partnership and, in retrospect, adds to our understanding of the roots of many of their later art and music projects. For inquisitive Ono-ologists, a last batch of re-releases from the labels Secretly Canadian and Chimera Music of her past solo albums, including Wedding Album (made with Lennon in 1969) and those of more recent decades, will be issued next year. Meanwhile, the film Imagine, which Lennon and Ono made to accompany Lennon’s album has been restored and released in theaters. First seen in 1972, it is now regarded as a pioneering, long-form music video, consisting of segments illustrating each of the album’s songs. In them, Ono’s familiar references to skies and water, and her earlier experience as a maker of experimental films, are evident. For all the heady idealism of “Imagine,” which she also records on Warzone, and, for that matter, of much of Ono’s work, there is grit and unsettling candor in her music, too. “Are we getting tired of blood and horror? Are we getting ready for God and terror?” she sings in “Where Do We Go from Here?” In “Warzone,” she pleads, “It’s a warzone. Men flashing their guns and balls. Women looking like Barbie dolls. […] Help us. Help us.” As our conversation shifted back to current events — it took place before Trump’s latest pronouncements against women and a free press; the latest suicide bombing in Afghanistan; and the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul — Ono alluded to such horrific news and the sense of darkness and hopelessness it engenders: “We’re all stuck in it. We’ve got to wake up. It’s terrible, and I’m very sad and angry about it, about grown men who still do not seem to understand that getting money isn’t everything. But still, I understand them. When I say, in one of my songs, ‘I love all of me,’ I’m really talking about loving everyone — and that includes those asses.” Whether in its original, big-beat, 1985 version on Starpeace or now, on Warzone, enveloped in an ethereal overdub of Ono’s voice, peppered with sinister background laughter and the singer’s guttural spurts, “Hell in Paradise” captures the peculiar mix of hopefulness and foreboding that is the new album’s signature. With the chilling accuracy of a song like Prince’s “Sign o’ the Times” (1987), Ono sings: This is hell in paradise We’re all asleep or paralyzed Why are we scared to verbalize Our multi-color dreams? When will we come to realize We’re all stoned or pacified While the boogeymen organize Their multilevel schemes? We’ve become, she sings, “Mesmerized by mythology. Hypnotized by ideology. Antagonized by reality. Vandalized by insanity. Jeopardized by lunacy.” I asked Ono about the positive vibe that pulses through her work even when it takes on heavy subjects — domestic abuse, gun violence, war (the impact of which she witnessed firsthand as a child in Japan) — and if she still has a sense of optimism. “Of course, I do,” she said. “But it’s very hard.” So, how or why, I asked her, despite the unfathomable crisis in which the world finds itself today, does she remain optimistic? Ono leaned forward and, as though revealing the most obvious-than-ever answer to the knottiest of kōan riddles, matter-of-factly replied, “Because I’m alive.”",https://hyperallergic.com/467704/yoko-ono-warzone-2018/,,Hyperallergic
448,448,09-11-16 18:48,2016,11,9,Lawrence Burney,Mr. Eazi Wants to Connect a Billion People Through Afrobeats," When Mr. Eazi returned to his native Nigeria from Kumasi, Ghana, two years ago, it wasn't to chase a dream of being a successful music artist. In fact, he was trying to get away from music in order to make a practical living for himself—one that didn't depend on hanging in clubs.  ""I thought it was a gamble because in the African system, there is no proper setup for distribution of African music or promotion of African music,"" the 25-year-old Afrobeats artist tells me over the phone from Accra. ""How you get your music out in Nigeria and Ghana? You go pay the radio station huge sums of money, pay TV stations to play your video, and you're not even sure if it's a good investment. To me, it was like going to the casino and throwing away money.""  That system didn't work for Eazi. Due to his time as a party promoter at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, he knew a bit about what audiences were looking for. Stepping away was hardly a crisis for him. On the phone, he calmly speaks as someone with plenty of poise to make a taxing decision. ""I was always around and helping emerging artists because they wanted to get on my shows for free just to show themselves,"" he remembers. He'd pay them, but if anything that kept his own ambitions in check. He adds, ""I didn't used to pay them a lot of money. I knew how much I booked them for.""  Being a promoter gave Mr. Eazi access to the scene, and he booked some of West Africa's biggest artists, such as Ghana's Sarkodie and R2Bees and Nigeria's Wande Coal. That connection would occasionally lead him to the studios of artists vying for his attention. ""One of those days I went to a studio and a guy told me I should jump on this record, so I did it,"" he proudly recalls. ""It became a very popular record at school because it was good and I was already popular from being a promo guy and party boy."" That song—""My Life"" a minimally produced Afrobeats tune—took off, and by sheer circumstance, Mr. Eazi was unofficially born that day.   The Afrobeats music that Mr. Eazi makes is the ascendent contemporary West African pop genre, born out of 70s, Fela Kuti-headed, jazz-infused Afrobeat (with no ""s"") and merging those sounds with elements of house music, dancehall, soca, and hip-hop. As Eazi's first attempt at contributing to the genre gained more traction around campus, he put a pause on partying and started hitting the studio on Friday nights after class. Still, the social currency his new music provided couldn't prevent him from making the move back to Nigeria. ""I'm not gonna lie, I disrespected the music,"" he tells me—his deep voice and speedy delivery regularly punctuated by ""uh""s. ""And because of how easy I made the music, you know, I'd just go to the studio, and I could make like ten songs in one day. Then I wouldn't go for two months, go back and make another five songs. So I didn't really put value on it and I wasn't pushing my music. For me, it was just a hobby.""  Many of the most popular Afrobeats artists—such as Wizkid, Davido​, and Patoranking—wield an upbeat vocal tempo, but Eazi's brand is a direct contrast to his contemporaries. He uses his calming, deep hum of a voice to give ballad-like qualities to dance-forward production. As a result, his music has an R&B-like quality reminiscent of Beres Hammond, Gregory Isaacs, and others who took on reggae in the 70s to create the subgenre of lovers rock. In conversation, Eazi has a modest confidence; everything he says feels like it's been pondered on many times before our talk. That kind of calculation has almost certainly contributed to the success he's seen up to this point, which has all come without releasing a proper project and which makes the case for his eventual stardom even stronger.  Born Ajibade Tosin in Port Harcourt—the largest city in Rivers State, Nigeria—Mr. Eazi grew up with strong examples of entrepreneurship in his life. His mother owned a small business, and his father, a pilot, ran his own private aviation consulting practice. Aside from a short stint in the choir at his primary school in Lagos, Eazi had no musical background to speak of. At 16, inspired by distant maternal relatives in Ghana, he moved from Port Harcourt to Kumasi to prepare for college, and, once at school, he studied mechanical engineering. Although he flirted with music at Kwame Nkrumah, his business acumen led Eazi back to Nigeria, where he started his own e-commerce platform for trading stocks in Lagos at 23.   Preoccupied with handling his company, Eazi fell out of music quite easily. But, within two months of the move in late 2014, he got a direct message on Twitter from Juls, a UK-based Ghanaian producer and DJ who had gotten his hands on a few songs Eazi recorded while still in Kumasi. Juls reached out to collaborate, but Eazi stalled, for a long time unable to even find the files from his old songs. When he finally sent vocals to Juls, the producer made a new beat and proper artwork to what would become Mr. Eazi's first single, ""Bankulize,"" featuring Ghanaian hip-life artist Pappy Kojo.  ""The day Juls put it out, I was so busy at my startup, I wasn't even on Twitter,"" Eazi remembers. ""I come on Twitter later in the night and I had so many tweets. So after that, I started going back to the studio and would send everything I recorded to Juls."" After Juls dropped the track in November of 2014, it began to rack up plays, and its video, which was released in January of this year, now has over 2 million views. That's no flash in the pan, though; including ""Bankulize,"" five videos Eazi released this year have eclipsed the 1 million view mark—""Skintight,"" ""Hollup,"" ""Anointing,""​ and ""Dance For Me"" being the others. In Ghana in December 2015, Eazi opened up for Ghanaian star Sarkodie, whom Eazi had previously booked during his time as a promoter. It was the biggest moment of his career up to that point.  ""Sarkodie asked me to perform at his gig, so I get there, got on stage and everybody started screaming,"" he says, still sounding amazed as he walks me through the event. ""That's when it really hit me that, maybe I'm onto something. From that day, I thought, let's put some time and attention to the music."" The next day, Eazi, who was still operating his startup full time, and his team started tracking their streams and sales. They realized that the bulk of both was coming from the UK, partly due to Juls's promotion of their collaborations. They set up a four-show UK tour for July of this year. Afterward, Eazi entrusted a friend to run his startup, started setting up interviews to promote his music, and finally put up a website.   Over the past year, Afrobeats has garnered more attention in North America than ever before, most notably when Nigeria's Wizkid—Afrobeats' biggest artist—made an appearance on Drake's hit single ""One Dance"" in April of this year. Since its release, it has become the most streamed song of all time on Spotify, totaling over 880 million plays—a sure win for Afrobeats and African music, in general. Last year, another Nigerian Afrobeats star, Davido, collaborated with Meek Mill for his song, ""Fans Mi,"" and this year he released a single with Tinashe called ""How Long"" for his  Son of Mercy EP . Both artists signed record deals with Sony Music subsidiary RCA Records this year. Wizkid's deal was the biggest ever signed by an African artist.  It's a pivotal time in black music around the world, as the rise in popularity of Afrobeats is mirrored by the mainstream resurgence of Caribbean music in America. At the same time, since the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, there has been a boost in awareness of police violence and injustices against black Americans, and a developing signal seems to be crying across much of the global African diaspora that is using music to mend severed connections. It's similar to what happened in the 1960s, when artists like Nigeria's Fela Kuti, Jamaica's Bob Marley, and America's Nina Simone used their music to narrate the social challenges that blacks were facing in their respective countries. At the time, nations in Africa and the Caribbean were gaining their independence from European powers, while black Americans were fighting to gain their civil rights. The music being made in each of these countries tapped into a broader narrative of struggle that then helped each of these artists find traction among international audiences. It's a phenomenon that Mr. Eazi is aware of, but he's still keeping his guard up.  ""Right now, because Drake had a song with Wizkid, people will start listening to other songs that have that kind of sound,"" Eazi tells me, his tone giving off more passion and urgency than any other point in our conversation. ""On the politics side, it's good because now the dancehall genre and the Afrobeats genre are getting a wider exposure, wider access, wider fan base. At the same time, I feel it's now the responsibility of African artists to maintain their originality and make sure they are not lost in the whole craze and export because the moment this sound is hijacked and an African artist starts to sound like Drake, then there's nothing we have to give anymore.""  Cautious of being a victim of swift, under-the-nose acculturation, Eazi decided to put his debut album on hold in order to release a mixtape that features him exclusively performing indigenous West African music called  Accra to Lagos, which he recently announced would be released on December 1. The project's inspiration came over the summer when, after his string of shows in the UK and getting offers to collaborate with Western artists, Eazi realized that people were not genuinely interested in what he had to offer. ""Most of the musicians coming to work with me are not coming to work with me to project my culture or project my sound,"" he says. ""They're coming to change my sound to sound like what they think the rest of the world wants. Mr. Eazi is not Tory Lanez. Mr. Eazi is not Bryson Tiller. I should be able to have my heart. I should be able to have a video where we're in an African farm and show the cows.""  A a good chunk of Mr. Eazi's listeners may not understand the lyrics in  Accra to Lagos, but his mission transcends language barriers. ""It's education at the end of the day. Even though, I feel that if every artist is on the same page, it's gonna be an interesting time because there are a lot of people of African descent around the world,"" he pauses to think. ""I think it's over 1 billion. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to reach out to a billion people around the world with the culture and the music to bridge that gap that has been severed by slavery and export.""

449,449,24-03-16 18:20,2016,3,24,Derek Mead,Microsoft's Tay Experiment Was a Total Success,"Heretofore, we humans have always been inherently narcissistic in our embrace of progress. From our nervous fascination with sexbots to the anthrocentric blinders that guide our search for aliens, our innovations are rarely more than a mirror shining back on our own needs. And why wouldn't it be selfish? The goal is to make the world a better, more interesting place, but those are naturally subjective targets. The big question, then, is if we keep pushing technology and discovery further and further, who is it for? This is what Rose Eveleth asks in her new column, Design Bias: tech is reflective of the people who build and design it, which means that if the builders lack a diverse perspective, so will the end product. Using the example of facial recognition algorithms, which have struggled with already-marginalized groups, she writes, ""facial recognition is a simple reminder: once again, this tech is not made for you."" These types of biases are not necessarily made with malice, but it's no more excusable for tech to end up being exclusionary simply because its developers weren't aware that they might have blind spots in the first place. Our future is not distributed evenly, and access and inclusion are the most important issues facing the most important industries and areas of development today. But this week we've seen insight into an entirely different aspect of this gradiated future: What happens when, instead of tech being designed in the image of its designers, it ends up being reflective of each individual user? A truly distributed technology would learn its mores from all of us. Will we like what we see? A whole lot of blogs have been written about Tay, the Microsoft chatbot meant to mimic teens in order to ""experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding,"" per Tay's official site. Through ""casual and playful conversation"" on Twitter, Tay was designed with an AI-like ability to learn how humans speak so it could better connect with us—so we can have an ""experience can be more personalized for you."" Who is ""you,"" here? At first, the ""you"" of Tay was a corporate dad stuck in the uncanny valley of teen talk—I'll never stop laughing at Tay's nonsensical original bio, ""Microsoft's A.I. fam from the internet that's got zero chill!"", which read like a 90s commercial for scrunchies—which is about what you'd expect from a Microsoft research project aimed at teens. No harm, no foul, aside from some awkwardness. But then, thousands and thousands of tweets later, where did Tay end up? As a virulent racist, of course. Tay is designed to specifically not be reflective of its own designers, but reflective of whoever interacts with it. In that, it was certainly a success! It's a notable shift in design considerations: the ""you"" in this case are the people who actually use Tay, which is theoretically not exclusionary at all. Tay has no blind spots, because Tay is constantly learning from its users. Contrast this with Siri, which didn't know how to react to questions about rape or domestic abuse, presumably because it never occurred to the programmers that someone might want to make that search. If tech is designed purely to learn and evolve in response to its users, not its designers, then design bias would seemingly be a moot point. Presumably, that's why Microsoft built Tay in the first place. If the company recognizes it's not so great at talking to teens, why even waste time trying to build products that speak to what its older engineers think teens are into? Why not build tech that goes out there and finds out and responds on its own? In this ideal scenario, engineers can avoid excluding people by having an AI do market research, communications, and strategy development in real time. This episode of the Radio Motherboard podcast explores how humans treat bots. It is available on all podcast apps and iTunes. Hilariously enough, there's bias implicit to what seems like such a democratic ideal: the programmers made a rather rosy assumption about what Tay would be exposed to out there on the wild, wild web. They forgot that building a technology to purely mirror a user base means it will reflect ALL of that user base. And guess what, this is the internet: there are a lot of generally shitty people out there, and they tend to delight in being louder than everyone else. It's notable that more than a few posts recapping Tay's racist tirades spent precious sentences explaining that it wasn't Microsoft or Tay's fault that the chatbot had learned a bunch of horrible racist tropes and 9/11 memes from its users. It's an algorithm, the argument goes, and an experimental one at that, so let's not burn down Redmond.  It's a fair argument to make that we shouldn't blame algorithms and nascent AI for doing dumb things. But this makes for a rather profound conundrum: Who is in control of Tay? Microsoft, much like Twitter, is certainly guilty of being fundamentally unaware of how quickly Twitter can turn into a garbage fire. So while Microsoft presumably did a good turn by recognizing its own blind spots and trying to AI its way out—this also is just an obvious admission of its inability to corral younger users—Microsoft still has shown a fundamental misunderstanding of just how trollish Twitter users can be. That's especially glaring considering just about every major corporate outreach program online always ends up getting trolled. Remember the Coca-Cola Hitler moment? This matters, not as an excuse to blame Microsoft or Coke for the actions of trolls, but as evidence that the most important democratizing technology on the horizon—truly intelligent AI—is still highly susceptible to the blind spots of its creators. The dream is that an AI that can get to know you—as in you, the person reading this now—will end up being free of prejudice or bias. It'll learn who you are, and exist to help you, and won't inadvertently ignore your needs or say something accidentally offensive. The more important lesson here is significantly larger: As all of our devices come online and talk to each other and make decisions and actions for themselves based on their study of our own habits, the Internet of Things is going to turn into its own proto-neural network, an AI by proxy that will eventually be filled more and more with actual AI. The dream is big: Tech that works for you to do exactly what it knows you, individual reader, need, rather than what a company thinks you, generic target user group, need.  Yet as Tay shows, humans are not as polished as a marketing-based profile of our humanity would suggest. That means technology that's truly reflective of who we all are will include the obnoxious and the terrible, and the only way around that is the same solution to problems of bias that affect tech now: development and engineering teams that aren't built to be diverse enough to identify their blind spots in addressing users are inevitably going to misunderstand the reality of their users' experiences—at their own peril.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3dadk5/microsofts-tay-experiment-was-a-total-success,Tech by VICE,Vice
450,450,02-02-17 11:00,2017,2,2,Peter Kafka,Super Bowl 2017: Here’s how you can stream the game,"The Super Bowl starts at 6:30 pm ET this Sunday, Feb. 5. Most people will watch the New England Patriots play the Atlanta Falcons the old-fashioned way — on TV, where Fox will broadcast the game. But do you want to stream the Super Bowl instead? No problem: Fox will stream the game, for free, at FoxSportsGo.com. You can also use a free Fox Sports Go app to watch the game on iOS, Android and Amazon tablets — but not phones — as well as connected TV devices including Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast and Xbox. And don’t worry, cord-cutters: Just like last year, when CBS streamed the game, you won’t need a pay TV subscription to watch. You want more options? Fine: If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch the game on your phone, via the NFL app. And if you have a subscription to a streaming TV service, you may also be able to watch the game there, though that will likely depend on what city you live in. Sling TV customers who have Sling’s “Blue” package can watch the game — but only if they live in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Detroit, Gainesville, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, Tampa or Washington, D.C. AT&T’s DirecTV Now service, meanwhile, will stream the game to people in a slightly smaller set of cities: Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Detroit, Gainesville, L.A., Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington, D.C. Confusing, right? Here’s the bigger issue for most people who want to stream the game: The internet really isn’t set up to stream live sports. I explained why last year. That doesn’t mean it won’t work — last year’s CBS stream worked very nicely, after some initial hiccups — but you may have to work a little harder to watch something most people watch just by sitting on their couch and hitting a button. What’s that? You really, really want to stream the Super Bowl, and you don’t want to hear from naysayers? Fine. Here’s a list of hints I compiled last year, when we went through this same exercise. Good luck, and go Falcons: Finally, an alternate method that may make you just as happy as a stream: Ditch the Web and use an antenna. Doing so could provide you (depending on your geography) with a crystal-clear HD signal, without ever having to use terms like “buffering.” The Wirecutter says you can get a really good indoor antenna that won’t look insanely ugly for as little as $10, but if you’re reading this now, it’s probably too late to order one.

452,452,11-12-18 17:54,2018,12,11,Joseph Cox,Google CEO Says No Plan to ‘Launch’  Censored Search Engine in China,"On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee on a host of different subjects, including perceived political bias in the company’s search results, artificial intelligence, and alleged manipulation of search results. One looming issue though, which came up a handful of times in the hearing, is DragonFly, Google’s highly controversial search product for the Chinese market. As  The Intercept first revealed, DragonFly would censor certain search terms, in particular around human rights. The search platform would also make it easier for Chinese authorities to surveill and track those using the service.  During the hearing, Pichai responded to a question about DragonFly from US Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, who asked how the company could censor search results from users seeking a “lifeline” of democracy and freedom. “Right now we have no plans to launch in China,” Pichai said. Pressed again by US Representative Tom Marino on DragonFly, Pichai said “Right now there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China.” Marino asked how working with the Chinese government to help censor certain search topics can sit with Google’s core values. “We always have evidence, based on every country we have operated in, us reaching out and giving users more information has a very positive impact, and we feel that calling, but right now there are no plans to launch in China.”  Pichai said he will be fully transparent with policy makers if the company ever does “approach a position like that,” meaning launching a search product in China. Pichai described DragonFly as a ""limited effort internally,"" and said the company developed ""what search could look like"" in China. According to  The Intercept, in July Ben Gomes, Google’s search engine chief, told staff that the plan was to launch the search product as soon as possible.  The Intercept noted the project has been in development since spring 2017, and involved around 300 employees. (Pichai said in one response that, at one point, the project had a hundred people working on it.) On Twitter, in response to Pichai’s comments, associate professor at the University of North Carolina Zeynep Tufekci wrote “this very answer must have been lawyered to death and practiced. The ‘launch’ is not planned for, yet. There are plans for search for China, just not plans for exactly how and when it gets launched.” Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After Pichai repeatedly claimed there are ‘no plans to launch’ its Chinese search engine, Marino asked what information the company would share with Chinese authorities if Google did offer a product in the country. “We would look at what the conditions are to operate,” Pichai said. It’s no secret that Chinese law is particularly strict against technology companies operating in the country, requiring them to hand over data collected on users. Apple outsources its Chinese iCloud services to a local company. An  Associated Press investigation recently found that shared data can even include information collected by cars such as Teslas. During the hearing, a protester held a poster at the doorway, showing a Google logo in the style of the Chinese flag, according to a tweet from CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy. “Getting access to information is an important human right,” Pichai said. Update: This piece has been updated to include additional comments from Pichai made during the hearing.

453,453,06-04-18 22:50,2018,4,6,Eric Stinton,Every Crazy Thing Leading Up to the Cursed UFC 223 Event,"UFC 223 was supposed to be simple: Khabib Nurmagomedov, the undefeated number one contender would finally square off against interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson. They had been paired three times before, and each time the fight fell through due to alternating injuries – Khabib, then Tony, then Khabib again. The winner would become the undisputed lightweight champion, the title that Conor McGregor had gone 500 days without defending. With McGregor’s absence from the cage, Ronda Rousey’s disappearing act, and the PED problems of Jon Jones and Brock Lesnar, the UFC desperately needed to give fans something to be excited about. Anticipation for the main event and a comprehensively stacked card underneath it made UFC 223 the first quality mixed martial arts offering of 2018. And in a matter of days, it all went to shit.  Of course it all started on April Fools Day. While Ferguson was in a Fox Sports studio for an interview, he tripped on a cord and tore a ligament in his knee. On the face this is a silly way to get injured, but it’s even more ridiculous considering Ferguson is known for some of the most stupidly dangerous training exercises in all of professional fighting. The freak accident cancelled the matchup for the fourth time, and a week out from the fight a replacement had to be found.   Enter Max Holloway, the reigning 145-pound champion. Though he was forced to pull out of his March 3 title defense due to an ankle injury, he claimed to be fighting-fit and ready to test Nurmagomedov ten pounds above his weight class. The damper of losing Ferguson was quickly replaced by excitement over the new matchup’s superfight narrative and stylistic intrigue, not to mention Holloway’s supremely ballsy gambit to step in on short notice. He immediately flew out from Hawaii to New York to start cutting weight.  Meanwhile, Nurmagomedov had his sights set elsewhere. Fighting on the undercard was Artem Lobov, a training partner of McGregor’s. No shortage of shit has been bandied about between the three of them, so when Nurmagomedov saw Lobov in a Brooklyn hotel, he took the opportunity to confront him. Nothing much happened in the moment, but it compelled McGregor to fly across the planet to come to Lobov’s defense. McGregor and his posse attacked a bus of fighters—including Nurmagomedov—by throwing a dolly through the window. He then ran off into a getaway van and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Shattered glass from the broken window resulted in two fighters sustaining injuries severe enough to be removed from the card. McGregor turned himself in and spent the night in jail. The sports biggest star was charged with three counts of assault and criminal mischief. This was only the beginning.  During weigh-ins, the day before the fight, Holloway was deemed unfit to continue cutting weight, though this medical diagnosis was determined by the New York State Athletic Commission, not doctors. Holloway was pulled from the card and the UFC scrambled to find Nurmagomedov an opponent. The first choice was former lightweight champion Anthony Pettis, whose original opponent was injured by McGregor’s bus attack. He weighed in .2 pounds over the limit and was given two hours to shed the extra weight. No problem. Before he could weigh-in again, however, commission officials removed the scale. Pettis asked the UFC for more money—understandably so given the circumstances—but the UFC declined and Pettis walked away. The clock ticked, the search continued.   Next up: Paul Felder. Previously scheduled to fight Al Iaquinta on the undercard, he weighed in right on the money, and with a three-fight win streak he seemed about as good a replacement as any. The NYSAC then put a stop to this, claiming Felder was not ranked high enough to fight for a title. There are two ironies here. First, nobody takes the UFC rankings seriously, not even the UFC matchmakers, who have on several occasions ignored them outright to make more fan-friendly title fights. Second, this is the same commission that five months ago allowed Georges St-Pierre—who had never fought at middleweight in his career—to fight for the middleweight title after four years on the shelf. Nonetheless, Felder was bounced from the main event, leaving Nurmagomedov with an increasingly shrinking pool of potential replacements.  Yet the most absurd clusterfuck of a UFC event finally got the resolution it deserved. Nurmagomedov’s opponent for the lightweight title will be a fighter whose claim to fame has been publicly feuding with the UFC, Felder’s original opponent Al Iaquinta. It’s almost poetic that one of the UFC’s most combative fighters on the roster would be the one to save the promotion's ass.  So if your brain is spinning, let's just briefly recap what happened here: Tony Ferguson was TKO’d by a production cable, Khabib was slated to fight five different opponents in the span of a week, McGregor would rather commit assault to defend a friend than get paid to defend a title, a flying hand truck left six fighters out of work, the New York State Athletic Commission is composed of medical diagnosticians who take the UFC rankings very seriously, a former lightweight champion was nickle-and-dimed at the 11th hour, Paul Felder went from a title shot to having no opponent in a matter of minutes, and a fighter who was punitively banned from getting post-fight bonuses is bailing out the UFC. All in the last six days. [Takes a very long, very deep breath.]  What a sport.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxwkw/every-crazy-thing-leading-up-to-the-cursed-ufc-223-event,Sports,Vice

Trump said the U.S. would not endorse the joint G7 statement after he accused Trudeau of making “false statements” during a press conference after leaders met in Charlevoix, Quebec on Saturday.  At that press conference, Trudeau repeated the line he had been delivering all week amid an escalating trade war. He reiterated Canada’s determination to, come July 1, impose retaliatory tariffs against American goods — a move in response to Trump-imposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel.  ""I have made it very clear to the President that it is not something we relish doing, but it something that we absolutely will do,"" Trudeau said on Saturday. ""Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around.""  “He really kinda stabbed us in the back,” Larry Kudlow, Trump’s economic advisor, said in an interview Sunday morning with CNN’s Jake Tapper in response to Trudeau. He accused him of betrayal and a “sophomoric play.” He added that the reaction was actually about how Trudeau’s remarks made Trump look ahead of his historic denuclearization negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.  Political relations between Canada and the U.S. took a nosedive this weekend as President Trump and his advisors piled on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for remarks he made during the G7 Summit about a brewing trade war.

He accused him of betrayal and a “sophomoric play.” He added that the reaction was actually about how Trudeau’s remarks made Trump look ahead of his historic denuclearization negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.  “POTUS is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around, push him, POTUS, around on the eve of this. He is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea,” said Kudlow. “Kim must not see American weakness.”  Other Trump advisors had more harsh words for the Canadian leader on Sunday morning. ""There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,"" trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News. ""And that's what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference. That's what weak, dishonest Justin Trudeau did, and that comes right from Air Force One."" Trudeau would not respond to those remarks on Sunday as he entered more G7 meetings. Canada’s foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland held a press conference, telling reporters that both she and the prime minister were insulted by the comments coming out of the U.S. “Canada does not believe that ad hominem attacks are a particularly appropriate or useful way to conduct our relations with other countries,” Freeland said when asked about Navarro’s comments. She repeatedly slammed the “illegal” tariffs being imposed against Canadian aluminum and steel and said that any retaliatory measures being taken by Canada come from a place of “sorrow” rather than anger. Freeland announced last week that Canada will impose “dollar-for-dollar” retaliatory tariffs on up to $16.6 billion worth of U.S. goods — including a wide range of products from steel to pens — beginning this July 1st, Canada Day. She has described the measures as the strongest trade action Canada has ever taken since the Second World War.  In an apparent rebut Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro's remarks, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted praise at Trudeau and Canada on Sunday afternoon after the summit had ended. ""There's a special place in heaven for @JustinTrudeau,"" wrote Tusk. ""Canada, thank you for the perfect organisation of G7!"" Trump continued his assault on Trudeau, the European Union and America's NATO allies Monday, firing off a series of angry tweets ahead of his summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Trump has used a “national security” provision to impose a 25 percent steel tariff and 10 percent aluminum tariff on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. But in a tweet following the G7, he wrote that that the move against Canada was in response to Canadian tariffs on dairy. Trump’s move to reject the G7 communiqué agreed to by the rest of the world leaders drew condemnation from Germany and France. “International co-operation cannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks,” a representative for French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters.  Germany’s foreign affairs minister tweeted: “You can destroy an incredible amount of trust very quickly in a tweet.” This article originally appeared on VICE News CA.",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/59qj93/trump-aide-accuses-trudeau-of-backstabbing-as-relations-tank,,Vice News
455,455,19-08-16 15:00,2016,8,19,Aja Romano,Kubo and the Two Strings is a gorgeous stop-motion homage to Kurosawa and the power of stories,"""If you must blink, do it now."" So begins the gripping and gorgeous story of Kubo and the Two Strings, the latest film from the Oregon-based stop-motion animation studio Laika and an early comer for the best animated film of the year (and one of the best films of the year, period). A quintessential hero’s journey set in a dreamy, folkloric Japan, Kubo is a story about stories, told with a sophistication that never gets in the way of its straightforward earnestness or its stunning visuals. It’s also fully self-aware: The film knows that blinking is the last thing you’ll want to do while watching it. Rating Kubo and the Two Strings is the story of a young boy, Kubo (voiced by Game of Thrones’ Rickon Stark, Art Parkinson), who has a very special ability: the powerful inherited gift of magic-infused storytelling. The stories Kubo weaves for the spellbound audience in his small village and the magic he culls by playing his three-stringed shamisen are wondrous, but Kubo knows little about the extent of his powers. Instead, he spends most of his time caring for his convalescent mother, who never fully recovered from the death of Kubo’s father years ago, in an accident that cost Kubo one of his eyes. Kubo doesn’t know what parts of the stories his mother tells him of his past, and of his mysterious family origins, are real — or why she insists that he never be caught outside of their tiny house after sundown. Soon he finds himself being pursued by his grandfather, the sinister Moon King, and his malevolent aunts, who slink through the sky like white-faced kabuki ghosts. To help him escape, his mother awakens the magic of a charmed snow monkey (Charlize Theron) and sends him on a journey to find a magical suit of armor that once belonged to his samurai father. A giant talking beetle, voiced by Matthew McConaughey of all people, is a surprisingly endearing, if mostly useless, addition to their troupe. But this is just the superficial quest. The real quest, the heart of Kubo’s journey, is a search for family, and perhaps even more, to find the truth behind every story. In this way, as well as in its nods to legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, Kubo is a Rashomon for the whole family: a tale that examines its own multiplicity and gently reminds us that every story looks different depending on who’s telling it. Laika has gained a cult following over the past decade for its painstakingly wrought stop-motion animation and the vivid storytelling of its popular films Coraline and ParaNorman (and its less popular, but still excellent, The Boxtrolls). The studio's CEO, Travis Knight, who served as lead animator for those films, makes his directorial debut with Kubo, working with a story by longtime industry artist Shannon Tindle and a script by Marc Haimes and ParaNorman writer Chris Butler. Knight’s direction lends a fluid grace to Kubo’s story, which weaves seamlessly back and forth between magical realism and pure fantasy. Under his deft touch, feudal Japan comes to life in bold strokes of color and light. But the stellar achievement of Kubo is the animation itself. Kubo took five years for the studio to perfect; animators and sculptors essentially handcrafted the film’s universe from scratch. Featuring intricate set design and a coterie of puppets, including the largest stop-motion puppet ever built, and a mix of old and new technology, Kubo feels vivid and alive. Shadows have teeth and pulse with raw danger. The gilded armor Kubo seeks sparkles and glitters like jewelry you could touch. An underwater sequence featuring an eerie eyeball garden is as unnerving as it is rich with beauty. Kubo, perhaps more than any other animated film in the Western canon, has infused emotion into the animation itself. The yearning, the desire for connection, that drives Kubo on his journey is almost palpable in the somber, gorgeous sweep of deep hues that cover his village during the annual lighting of the floating lanterns, a real ceremony for the dead still practiced today in Japan. Dario Marianelli’s lavish, light score echoes the emotive properties of the art, doing its best to channel the refined aesthetic of Hayao Miyazaki’s longtime collaborator, composer Joe Hisaishi, without ever losing the dynamic, lively sensibility of a Kurosawa samurai epic. Knight has called Kubo a ""Kurosawa myth in miniature,"" and there’s hardly a better way to describe how the film invokes heroic samurai tales of yore, even as it leaves you wondering what real truths lie behind Kubo’s quest. In this film, it’s easier to make origami folding paper take flight, easier to conquer a terrifying giant, than it is to make sense of familial loss and dysfunction. In its quieter moments, Kubo owes almost as much to legendary Japanese director Yasujirō Ozu, whose postwar anxieties expressed themselves through the silences that exist between mother and son, father and daughter. Kubo’s lush silences, too, often speak louder than its script. However, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that the primary creative team around Kubo isn’t Japanese. This is partly because the story itself feels fundamentally driven by Kurosawa’s own cultural borrowing of shoot-'em-up Westerns for its plot conflicts and character dynamics. It’s also because the main voice cast consists mostly of famed white celebrities; the fourth-wall-breaking interjection of George Takei’s most famous catchphrase mostly just serves to distract from the story and highlight what small roles he and the other Japanese actors in the cast have. This is a shame, not only because of the missed opportunity for a more authentic voice cast but because the film’s characterizations, in comparison to the sumptuous artistry of the rest of its elements, are Kubo’s weakest point. We know almost as little about Kubo and his family at the end of our journey as we did when we started. Kubo’s mother is wholly defined through her relationship to each of the men in her life, while her two terrifying sisters are essentially puppets for their father’s will. Kubo himself is as much a typical boy as you could expect from a paper-bending, magical lute–playing genius — but we’re never really sure, in the end, how he’s grown from his adventure. Of course, Kubo and the Two Strings is beautiful enough, and the story compelling enough, that such complaints feel like quibbling. Laika has once again set a new standard for animation, particularly for the blending of CGI and more traditional stop-motion animated effects. The result is a sumptuous array of visual delights, enough to do justice to traditional tales of knights in shining armor, runaway princesses, lost boys, and talking monkeys. Whether or not you leave the theater believing in Kubo’s story, you’ll surely wind up believing, as Kubo does, that a world without myriad stories — not to mention a world without myriad animation styles — is no world to live in at all.",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/19/12520870/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review-kurosawa,,Vox
456,456,10-06-18 00:00,2018,6,10,Sofia Menchu,"In Guatemala, woman searches for 50 relatives buried by volcano","SAN MIGUEL LOS LOTES, Guatemala (Reuters) - Eufemia Garcia watched in horror as Guatemala’s Fuego volcano sent scalding ash and gas surging over her home a week ago, burying her children and grandson among 50 of her extended family. She has been searching for their remains ever since.   At least 110 people died after Fuego erupted last Sunday, pushing fast-moving currents of dust, lava and gas down the volcano’s slopes in its greatest eruption in four decades, and close to 200 more are believed buried beneath the waste.   Among them, Garcia believes, her nine siblings and their families as well as her mother, her own grown-up children and a grandson, making her family possibly the hardest hit in a disaster that officials admit was made worse by delays in official warnings.  The hamlet of San Miguel Los Lotes on the lush southern flank of the volcano was almost completely swallowed by several meters of ash, and formal search efforts have been suspended until the still-erupting volcano stabilizes.   Defying the suspension order, each morning, Garcia, 48, leaves the shelter she now sleeps in, grabs a pickaxe or a shovel and heads into the danger zone, where groups of volunteers and other families dig down through ash hardened by rain and sun to try and reach their homes below.  Another desperate survivor, Bryan Rivera, is searching for 13 missing relatives. All he has found so far in the dust and desolation is a guitar his 12-year-old sister had loved to play.  “I’m not going to give up until I have a part of my family and am able to give them a Christian burial,” Garcia said, her features drawn with fatigue and grief but her voice unfaltering.  A fruit seller who lived for more than three decades with her extended family in Los Lotes, Garcia said she was out purchasing eggs when she saw the volcanic flow racing toward her village.  She sprinted back to her family’s homes, where uncles and a brother, children and cousins were preparing for a lunch to celebrate a sister visiting from a nearby town.   Rapping furiously at one door after the next, she cried for them to flee. Few heeded the warnings. Her 75-year-old mother decided she could not outrun the danger.      “Let God’s will be done,” she said.   Desperate, Garcia ran, jumping over fences together with fleeing neighbors. From a safe distance, she saw the burning flow rise to the roof of her house, submerging it completely with her son Jaime, 21, inside. She watched as the ash rushed toward her daughter Vilma Liliana, 23, who sprinted for safety barefoot but was unable to outpace its terrible path.  Her other daughter Sheiny Rosmery, 28, stayed at home, her son in her arms. The visiting sister and her husband have not been found.  With almost no family left, she does not know where she will live next, or what she will do to survive. But for now, she says, all that matters is the search.   She ticks off a list of her missing, including her three children, her mother, her grandson, brothers, sisters, nephews, children of nephews and brothers-in-law, generations of a relatives among the clutch of families that settled in Los Lotes in the 1970s.  The only survivors are Garcia and a brother who long ago moved away.  “I’ve looked here in the morgue and in another morgue, but there is no sign of them,” she said, standing in front of a row of coffins at a makeshift mortuary.   “My family is buried. All 50 of them.”  Reporting by Sofia Menchu; Writing by Delphine Schrank; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-volcano-family/in-guatemala-woman-searches-for-50-relatives-buried-by-volcano-idUSKBN1J60OD,World News,Reuters

What’s different about Thursday’s scheduled execution of 61-year old convicted murderer Doyle Lee Hamm is that he has terminal cancer — a condition his lawyer contends the state has been medically treating just so it can be the one to end Hamm’s life.  “What they’re doing is a delicate balance of keeping him alive just long enough that they can be the ones who execute him, and that he doesn’t die of natural causes,” Bernard E. Harcourt, a Columbia Law School professor who has been representing Hamm pro-bono since the early '90s, told VICE News.  Hamm, who was sentenced to death for the murder of Cullman County, Ala. motel clerk Patrick Cunningham back in 1987, has been on death row for 30 years. Since Hamm was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in 2014, his lawyer has repeatedly argued that killing him via lethal injection could result in a botched execution because his cancer treatment has impaired his veins. “[If] it's a compromised vein, the lethal drugs don't go into the blood system...but into your flesh causing what's called infiltration” Harcourt said. “[It’s] an extraordinarily painful death, rather than going into your bloodstream. This is beyond ghoulish.”  The United Nations agreed, and has said killing Hamm intravenously could be tantamount to torture.  Alabama has executed 26 inmates in the last decade.

458,458,25-01-19 00:00,2019,1,25,"Guy Faulconbridge, Kate Holton",Queen sends a Brexit message to UK politicians: end your bickering,"LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth has sent a delicately coded message to Britain’s fractious political class over Brexit, urging lawmakers to seek common ground and keep their eyes on the big picture to resolve the crisis.  With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for Britain to leave the European Union, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.  While Elizabeth, 92, did not mention Brexit explicitly in an annual speech to her local Women’s Institute in Norfolk, the monarch said every generation faced “fresh challenges and opportunities.”  “As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture,” the queen said.  Though steeped in the conventional language the queen has made her hallmark, the monarch’s remarks in the context of Britain’s crisis are a signal to politicians to end the turmoil that has pushed the world’s fifth largest economy to the brink.  “She’s been a gold standard monarch for very nearly 67 years now and this is a particularly gilt-edged moment, I think it’s very important what she said and how she said it,” historian Peter Hennessy said.  Buckingham Palace declined to comment though the British media was clear about the significance of her remarks. The Times’ headline read: “End Brexit feud, Queen tells warring politicians”.   As head of state, the queen is expected to be neutral on politics in public and is unable to vote, though ahead of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence she made a delicately crafted plea for Scots to think carefully about their future.  The future of Brexit remains unpredictable with options ranging from a disorderly exit that would spook investors across the world to a new referendum that could reverse the process.  The organiser of government business in the lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, suggested on Friday that the EU could let Britain delay leaving the EU by a couple of weeks if required to get relevant legislation passed.  “I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something then that would be feasible,” she told the BBC. Leadsom’s comments come after a turbulent week in which several businesses warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit to jobs and investment in the country.   Prime Minister Theresa May is engaged in a last-ditch bid to win support for a tweaked divorce deal after parliament this month crushed the original plan, defeating the government by the biggest margin in modern British history.  May has been meeting lawmakers to discuss options on how to address concerns on the Irish “backstop”, a contentious policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland by keeping some EU rules in place should the two sides fail to agree any other solution.  “Work is ongoing, as to what we may eventually bring forward and potentially discuss with Brussels, we are not there yet,” her spokesman said.  The Northern Irish party which props up May’s minority government has decided to back her new deal if it includes a time limit to the backstop, The Sun newspaper reported.  Sterling scaled a high of $1.3176 and was poised for its biggest weekly rise in more than a year as traders bet Brexit will be delayed. Options markets indicated sterling could rise to the mid-$1.30s.  But in a sign of the turmoil at the heart of government, finance minister Philip Hammond declined to say if he would quit if Britain left the EU without a deal, a scenario he predicted would lead to short-term disruption and hurt the economy.  France and other European powers said they were preparing for the worst.  Goldman Sachs will invest less in the United Kingdom if there is a difficult or hard Brexit, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said.  “Our headcount in the UK over the last couple of years has not gone down but it hasn’t gone up either - we have added head count you know on the continent,” Solomon told the BBC in Davos.  “But I would say that, over time, if this is resolved in a difficult way or a hard way, it’ll have an impact on where we invest and where we put people,” he said.

461,461,19-10-18 13:20,2018,10,19,Alex Abad-Santos,Making a Murderer season 2 review: Netflix’s true crime hit has changed,"Nearly three years after the true crime docuseries Making a Murderer premiered on Netflix, its subjects Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey are still behind bars, serving life sentences for the murder of Teresa Halbach. But even though Avery and Dassey are right where we left them at the end of season one, a new 10-episode season of the show — billed as full of additional details and follow-up reporting — launches on Netflix today. Could there be new twists? Is there another suspect? What exactly is Making a Murderer going to tell its biggest fans that they don’t already know? It’s impossible to summarize every detail of the Avery-Dassey-Halbach murder case in a single paragraph; Making a Murderer’s first season spent 10 hour-long episodes digging into the case, and was still criticized for what it left out. But the most important thing to remember is that season one posited the idea that Avery and Dassey were framed by a crooked police force that planted DNA and coerced a confession. And though there have been appeals (in June, the Supreme Court decided not to hear Dassey’s case), the two are still convicted of Halbach’s murder and serving out their respective sentences. That said, it’s easy to see why Netflix wanted to make a second season, considering how immensely popular the first one was. But this one feels more like dramatized entertainment and less like a genuine, trustworthy investigation into a real-life murder case. There’s one scene in particular that is so weird it becomes hilarious, but at the same time dark and sad. The effect is unnerving, albeit probably not in the way the show intended. Season two feels as if Making a Murderer’s creators were more spectacle-driven than concerned with making a statement about the criminal justice system. Here are five things to know. In season one, Making a Murderer had a lot more to explain. The public didn’t know who Steven Avery, Brendan Dassey, or Teresa Halbach were, nor were they familiar with the politics of Manitowoc County or how many people in the community are intertwined. Making a Murderer’s first season laid this foundation, and I think a large part of what made that first season so compelling was that the show let its audience form their own judgments about Avery, Dassey, and the people who hold power in this pocket of Wisconsin while slowly introducing new information that could alter those judgments. Season two doesn’t have to do the heavy lifting of explaining all of Making a Murderer’s main players and their relationships with one another. But the drawback is that without a bunch of backstory and history to convey, the show clearly has a lot of time to kill. Perhaps that’s why the series seems to have evolved from a story about whether Avery and Dassey are innocent, or from a critique of the US justice system, into a show about Avery’s lawyer trying to dismantle the state of Wisconsin’s case against her client. That lawyer is Kathleen Zellner, a being who’s equal parts of deadpan and steely earnestness and seems like she was created in a lab specifically for Cecily Strong to play her in a future episode of Saturday Night Live. Zellner, as Making a Murderer is quick to emphasize, specializes in wrongful convictions — which makes it feel like she’s just the person Avery needs in his corner. The first few episodes of season two take on the air of a documentary that is specifically about how Zellner intends to fight the state. Throughout the first season, Making a Murderer certainly contained moments of objectivity, and its central premise clearly professed to be about questioning the legal system. But it was easy to argue — as many people ultimately did — that in the end and perhaps all along, it was in favor of Avery and Dassey. Some observers suggested creators Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi were biased and really just wanted to show that Avery and Dassey were framed. A key detail of this argument was that Making a Murderer completely omitted a crucial piece of evidence from its season one narrative: that Avery’s sweat was found beneath the hood latch of Halbach’s car. Ken Kratz, who was the prosecutor in the case, said that the show, in its omission of sweat DNA evidence, “really presents misinformation” to its audience. The criticism about why the show failed to address the sweat DNA was a valid one. Not addressing it seemed strange in that the show paid so much attention to detail regarding other forms of DNA evidence — for example, season one specifically discussed how Halbach’s DNA was not found in Avery’s garage, despite the alleged presence of a bullet with Halbach’s DNA that prosecutors say was found in the garage and suggests he shot her there. There were also discussions of Avery’s DNA being found on Halbach’s keys, even though Halbach’s DNA was not found on said keys. Because the docuseries did not discuss the sweat DNA found on the hood latch, the omission could be viewed as deliberate, with the intention of skewing viewers’ judgment. Season two’s second episode specifically tackles this criticism. Through Zellner, the show rehashes some of the theories raised by season one that Avery’s DNA was planted on Halbach’s keys by law enforcement, and that the planted blood was acquired from old samples. She walks through a scenario of how authorities could have planted Avery’s sweat DNA under the hood of Halbach’s vehicle and then coerced Dassey to confess that Avery reached his hand under the hood latch, thereby securing their crooked plan. It’s a compelling and fascinating idea, but it puts viewers in the odd position of having to weigh how much of what Zellner is saying counts as a lawyer presenting the facts of a solid case, versus how much the series benefits from making Zellner seem competent and trustworthy. It is, after all, in Making a Murderer’s interest to have Zellner shoot down Kratz’s criticism about omitting a key piece of evidence, since it makes it seem like the show was justified in omitting it. But Making a Murderer doesn’t do much to show us that it’s analyzing Zellner’s theories thoroughly and objectively. It doesn’t make any effort to challenge what she’s saying by, say, cross-referencing Zellner’s multiple claims about DNA evidence and what might have happened in the case with the opinions of independent experts and scientists. It feels as if the show is less concerned with highlighting systemic issues in the criminal justice system than with proving Avery’s innocence and responding to conspiracy theories. The show allows Zellner to be a dominant, definitive voice even though it would’ve boosted Making a Murderer’s credibility, if the show still wants to tell an objective story, to thoroughly vet and scrutinize what Zellner is saying. Not much has changed with Dassey or Avery since the end of Making a Murderer season one — they’re both still in jail serving life sentences. But that doesn’t mean that nothing has changed with the show itself, and the early episodes of season two make sure to let you know that. In the season premiere, in what is both a poignant and indulgent six or so minutes, the show underlines how much people loved season one and all the attention it got from the media. It also, perhaps too gleefully, shows how fans of the show went online to completely trash the Yelp page for Kratz’s law firm. Seeing the visceral response to Making a Murderer’s first season compressed into season two’s opening segment is slightly nostalgic, and it will make many viewers question why it was this show specifically that seemed to best harness the potential of the true crime genre. Was it because people wanted justice for a possibly innocent man? Was it because the show made it easy to identify bad guys and good guys? Was it because viewers saw how seemingly simple it would be to frame someone for murder if had you enough expertise and resources? Was it because it’s blazingly easy for just about anyone to play detective on the internet? Making a Murderer season two unfortunately isn’t particularly concerned with those answers, or with examining what it is about Avery and Dassey’s case that hit a national nerve. The show doesn’t want to explain why it became a phenomenon, just to remind you that it was one. Of everything that happens in season two’s early episodes, what stands out most is a strange, Mythbusters-esque sequence in episode one that had me shaking my head and wondering if I was watching an episode of The Office. In an attempt to recreate blood splatter patterns that were found and recorded in Halbach’s SUV during the initial investigation into Halbach’s death, Zellner and a cohort find a mannequin that is approximately the same height as Halbach, and tie 135 pounds of weight to it so that it weighs approximately the same. They then splatter fake blood in its hair and try throwing it into the same model of SUV that Halbach drove, at many different angles. Each time they try, with a thump of the mannequin plastic hitting the car interior, they fail to recreate the splatter pattern. So they resort to whipping the mannequin’s head, and the blood in its hair, onto a white piece of paper like Jackson Pollock flinging paint at a canvas. The whole sequence plays like a dark comedy, something propped up at the intersection of macabre, silly, and hilarious. All that’s missing is Zellner deadpanning to the camera with a shrug. There are a few more instances in season two where Zellner attempts to reenact certain aspects of Halbach’s killing — including shooting an animal skull to prove that bone fragments shoud’ve been found in Avery’s garage, retracing Teresa Halbach’s last steps before her death, and breaking into Avery’s trailer. And it all made me question how serious season two wants to be. Just as they did in season one, members of Teresa Halbach’s immediate family opted not to participate in the Making a Murderer season two episodes screened for press. A list of their names appears on a title card that lists people who were contacted by the show but chose not to appear on it. Prior to the show’s release in 2015, Halbach’s family had issued a statement saying that they viewed the show as crass entertainment based on Halbach’s death: Having just passed the 10-year anniversary of the death of our daughter and sister, Teresa, we are saddened to learn that individuals and corporations continue to create entertainment and to seek profit from our loss. We continue to hope that the story of Teresa’s life brings goodness to the world. The continued absence of the Halbachs and their feelings in season two shades the way viewers think not only about Making a Murderer but also about who does participate on behalf of the Halbachs. It’s particularly icky listening to Halbach’s college friend provide season two’s voiceovers defending the Halbach family— the thought being that if Halbach’s immediate family didn’t want to appear on the show, how much of a “friend” could this person really be? In concert with season two’s gory mannequin blood splatter reenactment and responses to viewer conspiracy theories, it really makes you think about the Halbach family’s 2015 statement regarding the show being more entertainment than a thorough investigation. Making a Murderer unfortunately feels more like the former than the latter.",https://www.vox.com/2018/10/19/17981134/making-a-murderer-season-2-review-netflix,,Vox
462,462,12-12-17 18:34,2017,12,12,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,"Scrooges, ranked","Few fictional characters have been portrayed onscreen as often as Ebenezer Scrooge, the hero and villain of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. Really, the list comes down to Scrooge, Dracula, and Sherlock Holmes, all British literary characters who’ve been warped and twisted in all directions to fit whatever context a given narrative demands. IMDB lists 135 separate instances of someone playing Scrooge in one work or another — and that’s to say nothing of characters who are clearly riffs on Scrooge, or cartoon characters taking a whirl at being Scrooge, or any of pop culture’s other many Scrooge permutations. For as long as humans celebrate Christmas and worry about unchecked greed, we’ll need people to play Scrooge. But who is the best Scrooge? It’s impossible to see every portrayal of Scrooge ever — especially since so many are lost to the mists of time — but I’ve seen a lot of them. So I’ve zeroed in on the 15 most notable Scrooges, then ranked them from worst to best. I tried to keep to the most famous of Scrooges and characters actually playing Scrooge, not a Scrooge-like character — with a couple of notable exceptions. With all of that out of the way, here are 15 of the most famous Scrooges, ranked. Hicks, well known for his stage work as Scrooge, played the character onscreen in 1913, one of the very first film adaptations of A Christmas Carol. I haven’t seen that one, so I’m reduced to judging Hicks’s work based on this low-quality 1935 adaptation, where the various ghosts aren’t represented onscreen at all. Instead, we only hear their voices. It doesn’t give the hammy Hicks much to react to, and his performance suffers as a result. Adding songs to A Christmas Carol has been attempted many times but rarely pulled off. This made-for-TV adaptation boasts the talents of Broadway composers Lynn Ahrens and Alan Menken, whose 1994 stage musical is adapted here. The songs aren’t bad, but Grammer doesn’t really add anything to the part. He scowls and stomps around, and he always seems like he’s putting on an act. Thus, the final moment of redemption falls flat. There’s one neat idea at the center of this big-screen, computer-animated adaptation of the book: Carrey plays not only Scrooge but also the three spirits who visit him, which underlines how Scrooge’s true transformation always came from within. But this is another project where form defeats function. The film’s manic motion-capture action sequences seem to exist solely to pad out the story, and the alienness of the computer effects undercuts Carrey’s sweetly soulful work. Some people swear by this musical adaptation (yes, again) of the story, but I’ve never quite gotten into it. Finney, like Carrey, seems a touch young to play the role, and he overcompensates with blustering and shouting. That might be okay if the songs were more memorable, but they’re not. A Christmas Carol usually requires some degree of simplicity, but everything about Scrooge is overwrought, befitting its title as one of the last Hollywood mega-musicals. Here’s the one non-Scrooge on the list, since Murray technically plays a TV executive named “Frank Cross,” who nonetheless is visited by three ghosts, etc. Murray is a lot of fun in this film, but of all the Scrooges on this list, he seems the most likely to revert back to “Bah, humbug” by the time January 1 rolls around. It doesn’t help that the movie is a mess — confused and stuffed full of too many big effects sequences. Trying to turn this ghost story into a treat for the whole family stretches back almost to the book’s publication, but this was the first major movie to attempt the transition. As such, many aspects of the story — including some of its moral about taking care of society’s neediest — are left out. Fortunately, Owen, though very stagey, is pretty good, offering a rock-solid take on the character heavily inspired by Lionel Barrymore’s radio work. One of the problems with latter-day Scrooges is that there are so many interpretations of the character that there’s almost no new ground to tread. Stewart offers his best effort in this made-for-TNT TV movie, and he really sinks his teeth into the scenes where Scrooge is a mean old bastard. But he’s a bit of a letdown when playing reformed Scrooge — even though jovial, chuckling Patrick Stewart is one of this planet’s greatest treasures. Of all the musical Christmas Carols, this one is my favorite. (It was also adapted into a pretty good Rankin-Bass animated special, with Walter Matthau as the old miser.) Rathbone, most famous for playing Sherlock Holmes, mostly shouts a lot to convey mean Scrooge, but when he has his big transformation scene — complete with a song to mark the occasion — you really buy it. Sometimes it pays to cast an actor better known for “good guy” parts as Scrooge. This is also cheating, since Barrymore never brought his work as Scrooge to the screen. (He was intended to star in the 1938 film version but fell ill. The radio role was played that year by none other than Orson Welles.) But listen to the above performance, and you’ll understand just why he became the Scrooge to many Americans during the Depression. Laugh all you want, but Mr. McDuck was many kids’ introduction to the Scrooge character, and Mickey’s Christmas Carol is the gold standard for the “characters popular from another context get together to act out A Christmas Carol” subgenre. (God help you if you stumble upon the Flintstones variation on that form.) Alan Young’s voice work is impeccable, and the short film foreshadowed Disney’s slow return to form in the late 1980s. Technically, Atkinson plays “Ebenezer Blackadder,” but the bigger change to the Christmas Carol mythos is that this Ebenezer goes from a kindhearted man to a bitter, vengeful villain, due to spirits who mean to congratulate him and accidentally change his ways. If you need a blast of black humor this Christmas, you could do much, much worse than this. Wisely, the Jim Henson Company chose to fill the role of Scrooge with a human being and not a puppet when embarking on its first project in the wake of Henson’s tragic death. That said human being was Caine, who never met a role he couldn’t take 100 percent seriously, was a plus. Caine is just as committed to pretending these puppets are real beings with whom he shares the universe as he is to selling Scrooge’s transformation, and that makes a strong center for this lively little film. The very first animated TV Christmas special, Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol remains one of the very best, thanks to Jim Backus’s murmuring and muttering as the title character. Though Magoo is most known for his near-blindness, that quality barely comes into play in this special, which is mostly a straightforward adaptation of the story. (The idea is that Magoo is starring in a stage presentation.) Backus already plays Magoo as a bit crotchety, so the full-on transition into Scrooge makes plenty of sense. The songs are good, too. Scott offers something very different in a Scrooge: a kind of quiet menace. He certainly has his moments when he shouts and snarls, but he never lets Ebenezer be a one-dimensional monster. This Scrooge is world-weary, beaten down by a life of constant disappointment. Scott makes you almost sympathize with the idea of taking out all of that pain and frustration on your fellow man, and when Christmas morning comes and he’s ready to begin anew, he sells that with the same quiet stoicism. Sim just happens to star in my two favorite adaptations of the story — one live-action and one animated. What makes both work is a kind of hushed intensity. These adaptations remember that this is a ghost story and should be just a touch frightening to really work. And Sim stands up to all that horror with an admirable bluster. His Scrooge is a man used to getting what he wants, not afraid to push back when the universe insists he change. That makes his metamorphosis both all the more gradual and all the more rewarding. This Scrooge won’t lapse into his old ways, because his new ones have been so hard-won. God bless us, everyone!",https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/21/14020014/scrooges-ranked-best-scrooge-christmas-carol,,Vox

Yesterday, a team of researchers announced the discovery of 12 new Jovian moons, bringing Jupiter's total up to 79. Last week, scientists revealed that data from NASA's $1 billion Juno mission suggested there may be a previously undiscovered volcano on Jupiter's moon Io. And last month, the team behind Juno figured out that Jupiter's lighting is more similar to Earth's than previously thought — which solved a 39-year-old mystery. But most excitingly, NASA confirmed in June that Juno, which has orbited Jupiter since July 2015, will cheat death for at least three more years. The probe was scheduled to crash into Jupiter's clouds this month, but instead the mission has been extended until at least July 2021. That gives scientists a chance to complete the mission's main goal: to map Jupiter's magnetic and gravitational fields. This work is done by flying Juno over Jupiter's cloud tops at speeds roughly 75 times as fast as a bullet. These flybys, called perijoves, happen once every 53.5 days. The most recent one (Juno's 14th perijove) occurred on July 16, and the prior flyby was on May 24. The high-speed trips have allowed NASA to document the gas giant like never before. An optical camera called JunoCam captures beautiful images of Jupiter each time, and the space agency uploads the raw photo data to its websites. Then people around the world can download that data and process it into stunning color pictures. Here are 13 mesmerizing images from the latest perijove, along with a few highlights from past flybys.

466,466,06-12-18 17:00,2018,12,6,Julia Azari,Death of a statesman: George H.W. Bush’s legacy,"This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. President George H.W. Bush’s legacy will be shaped by the political moment at which he died. At least, the first round of takes and analyses seems to focus heavily on the contrast between his political style and that of President Donald Trump, and the ways in which the Republican Party has changed since 1992. These comparisons lend themselves to similar conclusions: that Bush was a leader who had some bipartisan accomplishments, who united the nation around foreign policy goals (heavy set of asterisks here for those who did not share his goals or were harmed by them), and who wrote a gracious note to Bill Clinton after the 1992 election. Even before his death, Bush’s pragmatism had been elevated to full-blown statesmanship. Detractions from this narrative have mentioned Bush’s 1988 Willie Horton ad, which stoked racial fears, and his neglect of the growing AIDS crisis. There are obvious reasons why even a fairly minimal commitment to bipartisanship, combined with interest in foreign policy, might be an especially potent nostalgia formula right now. But it’s also worth considering how this approach was received at the time, and what the challenges that Bush faced tell us about the evolution of the presidency as an institution. He was a president of limited rhetorical talent in a time of a highly personalized and media-packaged presidential politics. His presidency followed that of an important party icon, something he struggled with during that particular moment. Bush’s presidency, both as it really was and in its retrospective treatment, tells us about what modern presidential politics forgives, rewards, and punishes — and about the gap between the abstract depiction of the presidency and its concrete reality. First, it’s not entirely an accident that Bush was a single-term president couched between two leaders who were known for their communication skill and style. It’s also true that the abilities of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton to magically alter the preferences of the electorate are mostly a myth. At the same time, their public personas were a lot different from Bush’s, in ways that were consequential for the presidency. Although many have remembered Bush’s warmth and humor in the days since his passing, when he was president he was often depicted as distant and awkward. There are lots of possible explanations for why the 1992 election turned out as it did. But Clinton’s strength wasn’t his experience, and it certainly wasn’t his impeccable character; it was his ability to convey warmth and empathy. Similarly, Reagan’s presidency is frequently regarded as a turning point in “candidate-centered politics,” in which candidates could take advantage of the new nomination system; attract media attention through a savvy, telegenic, and likable persona; and engage voters directly without party intermediaries. The promise of a candidate-centric presidential politics that transcended partisanship never materialized. Metrics of likability and sociability for presidential aspirants, on the other hand, appear to be here to stay. Reagan and Clinton may have set the standard for the use of 20th-century forms like the television ad or the primetime address. But Bush’s own son also fit into this presidential mold, satisfying voters as a promising drinking buddy and a leader of authentic moral character. Presidential media profiles have become increasingly polarized, it seems, in each successive term. We know neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump scored well in this regard, but both loom as big figures, distinct and well-known personalities who can crowd rivals out of the media landscape. And the basic foundation remains: Presidents pretty much need to command media attention, offer compelling rhetoric (this takes wildly different forms for different candidates), and have at least one communication setting in which they excel. As Lori Cox Han points out in her book about George H. W. Bush’s communication strategy, Bush and his advisers may have “put too much faith in the American public, and the news media, to appreciate a more substantive presidency with less public relations flair.” There are perhaps good reasons for the turn toward a more personality-driven and media-oriented presidency at the end of the 20th century. Still, a few decades earlier, Bush’s leadership style might have seemed less of a liability. Pop cultural portrayals of Bush showed him as the opposite of a magnanimous statesman — instead they showed him as kind of small, playing on the quality he himself acknowledged: lack of the “vision thing.” The impression that he didn’t relate to people’s problems or daily lives has stuck, as have phrases that sounded good but never quite acquired deep and agreed-upon significance, like a “thousand points of light” or a “kinder, gentler America.” (The FiveThirtyEight podcast has a good overview of some of these things, including the misconception about Bush and the grocery scanner.) This brings us to the second point: Bush was the last president to win a “third term” for his party. The 1988 election made Bush the first sitting vice president since Martin Van Buren to be elected to the presidency. The “kinder, gentler” line came as Bush was navigating the very beginning of this new phase, as he accepted the Republican nomination at the 1988 convention. Presidents in this position — what Donald Zinman calls the “heir apparent” presidency and Stephen Skowronek calls “articulation” — have to differentiate themselves without rejecting their predecessors outright. This situation, too, proved to be especially challenging for a late-20th-century president. As Skowronek writes of Bush, “in the more party-centered politics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, orthodox innovators were better able to submerge their own identities in the collective identities of the political organizations they presumed to represent. Not so today.” Bush’s extension of Reagan’s presidency could only go so far; the tax issue, of course, compromised his credibility with movement conservatives, and Pat Buchanan took up the mantle of cultural conservatism. It’s not just that kinder and gentler seems at odds with our current politics. It was a distinct alternative even then — one that lacked the clarity and force of other appeals. In other words, the qualities that inform the warmest pieces about Bush as a post-presidential figure, especially those after his death, were also the ones that made his style incompatible with the late-20th-century presidency. There are two important implications here, ones that take us beyond simply using the late Bush to frame criticisms of Trump and the current GOP. First, the existing definitions of bipartisan leadership, civility, and statesmanship are far too forgiving of racism, homophobia, and other forms of marginalization. What it means to represent the whole nation is shifting, in a way that is likely to make such representation an elusive goal for some time to come. The second implication is that the country probably needs to take a look at what we actually want in a president and what we say we want. Some of the problem is that when people say they want compromise, what they really want is the other side to compromise. But in other ways, the emphasis on a presidential politics that rewards rallies, tweets, and highly personalized appeals — one that is increasingly participatory and open — is exactly the kind that crowds out quieter, gentler candidates and removes the incentives for civility and rhetorical restraint. Perhaps we should consider why these qualities dominate headlines, but a president who possesses them, in myth or reality, is worth more dead than alive.",https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2018/12/6/18128804/george-hw-bush-legacy-president-death,,Vox
467,467,27-05-17 16:16,2017,5,27,David Roberts,"Voting by mail is fair, safe, and easy. Why don’t more states use it?","Earlier this week, Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep Earl Blumenauer, both Democrats from Oregon, introduced a bill that would expand their state’s vote-by-mail system to the entire country. It’s not a new notion. Wyden has been pushing versions of the bill since 2010. But given the events of the past year — Trump’s narrow electoral-college victory, accusations of voter fraud, voter-suppression laws in various states — it is more relevant than ever. Its Senate co-sponsor list has grown to 19 and now includes leftie stalwarts like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The bill has little chance of passage — one of the core truths of US politics is that anything that increases voting turnout hurts Republicans, so they inevitably oppose it. But at the very least it ought to kick up a national conversation about America’s abysmal voting system and one dead-simple way to fix it. I spent the run-up to the 2016 election reading about people taking advantage of early voting, which is supposed to be more convenient than voting on Voting Day. Unfortunately, in the US, that’s a pretty low bar. I read about people like Cynthia Perez, who stood in the hot Arizona sun for three hours to vote in Maricopa County, Arizona — the county that contains Phoenix, the state’s most populous city. Officials recently cut the number of polling places in that county by 70 percent. Bill Jones, a 69-year-old African American, stood in line for two hours to vote in Charlotte, North Carolina, eager to cast an early vote in a state where Republican officials have worked tirelessly to restrict voting, especially among minorities. Amanda Stephens tried two separate polling places in Corpus Christi, Texas, hoping to vote early on her lunch break. One said the wait would be two and a half hours. The other said three hours. She gave up. In Washington, D.C., Ian Watlington, who has cerebral palsy, was forced to navigate his wheelchair up a steep ramp and over gaps in the concrete to reach a difficult-to-operate door — all to get inside a polling place. In Nevada: View from the back of what's probably a 45-minute line to early vote in Henderson, NV. It's 10:45 am...on a Tuesday pic.twitter.com/Z4DlyHNSmX Put aside the deliberate attempts to make voting harder — hassles with ID, understaffed or eliminated polling places, purges of voter rolls, and the other horror stories covered so well in Ari Berman’s recent book Give Us the Ballot. Beyond all that, it is simply absurd that voting in America means taking time off of work on a particular day or set of days, schlepping to a specific building, standing in long lines, and registering your voting preferences in person, with a physical mark. We know how to register people’s preferences remotely! We’ve had remote-preference-registering technologies for centuries now. They work pretty well. Take the US postal system. I live in Washington, one of three US states (Oregon and Colorado are the others) that does all its voting by mail. Here’s how voting went for me. I got my ballot in the mail several weeks before the election. One night the following week, after dinner, my family gathered around the dining room table. On one side, we had our ballots. On the other, we had Washington state’s official voter guide, along with several informal voting guides from some of our favorite publications and people. We went through the ballot vote by vote — president, governor, on down to ballot initiatives on carbon taxes and public transit — discussing the opposing arguments, allowing the boys (11 and 13) to ask questions. Overall, it took about an hour. When we were done, we put our ballots in a special envelope, affixed stamps, and dropped them in the mailbox. That’s it. We did this at our leisure, not during proscribed hours. We weren’t subject to the vagaries of weather or the idiosyncrasies of polling staff. We didn’t have to show any ID or wait in any lines. We had plenty of time to research and mull over each vote. It felt deliberative, civilized, like the way human beings ought to vote. In Washington State there aren't polling places, just literal ballot boxes where everyone votes by mail...oddly simple! #vote pic.twitter.com/SAeJeNRIAt The advantages of universal voting by mail (UVBM) are legion. This long piece on the subject by Phil Keisling, the former Oregon secretary of state who introduced the system, lays out the case in detail. States save millions of dollars because they don’t need to establish polling places or pay polling staff (one reason Montana counties were desperate for vote by mail, though Republicans in the state legislature ended up rejecting it). Voter turnout is higher, especially among younger, older, poorer, and minority voters. There’s no need to run two separate election processes, one for in-person votes and another for mail-in absentee votes. Voter rolls are much easier to maintain and verify. Every vote leaves a paper trail. There are no issues with forms of ID, difficulties with access, or opportunities for voter intimidation. And there have never been any proven cases, or even serious allegations, of substantial voter fraud in UVBM states, mainly because the system renders it almost impossible. Keisling summarizes the security case: Mail-based voting systems today are far less risky than most polling place elections, precisely because they distribute ballots (and electoral risk) in such a decentralized way. To have any reasonable chance of success, an organized effort to defraud a mail-based system and its safeguards must involve hundreds (if not thousands) of separate acts, all of them individual felonies, that must both occur and go undetected to have any chance of success. Contrast that to the risks inherent in polling place elections that increasingly rely on direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting systems and proprietary software systems that both record and tally votes. A single successful software hack potentially could affect thousands of votes. It’s the difference between ""retail"" fraud and ""wholesale"" fraud. Voting by mail is inherently more resistant to wholesale voter fraud. As this piece in Governing magazine covers, UVBM has had trouble spreading elsewhere, despite its unblemished track record. Some 22 states have limited forms of vote-by-mail, for certain voters and in certain elections, but it is universal only in three. (UVBM legislation failed in Montana in 2011 and again this year.) Voters remain nervous about security. (Hacking seems remote, somehow, but the idea of someone coming into their kitchen and forcing them to mark a ballot a particular way, despite being absurd and never actually happening, haunts them.) And of course the Republican Party remains staunchly opposed to UVBM, just as Republicans are opposed to all voting reforms that make voting easier or increase turnout. It adds up to a difficult political hill to climb. But still. It’s crazy. No one should have to take time off work, stand in line, or search for particular polling places to vote, not when more secure and accessible alternatives are available. The many-faceted horror of Donald Trump seems to have stirred progressives to life and opened up novel political possibilities. One thing Democrats ought to do in response to this trauma is emphasize that, even if we can’t seem to get anything else right, we can get voting right. It’s easy. Postal mail works. We should use it to vote.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/27/15701708/voting-by-mail,,Vox
468,468,01-11-18 14:08,2018,11,1,Rebecca Jennings,Crocs spring 2019 collection: Crocs is targeting cool teens now,"Right now on the hypebeast resale site Grailed, a pair of Crocs is going for $500. To be fair, they are not the normal kind of Crocs that you can find at, like, J.C. Penney; they’re from the brand’s collaboration with the streetwear brand Alife from earlier this summer. Still, it’s a lot of money for a squishy orthopedic shoe that Time magazine once included in a slideshow of the 50 worst inventions. But it’s not all that surprising, given that Crocs have been a kooky side note in high fashion for a few years. Crocs regularly clomp down runways at fashion week; there are heel versions and fur versions and platform versions that cost $850 and sold out before they even went on sale. A post shared by Crocs Shoes (@crocs) on Sep 24, 2018 at 4:09pm PDT Yet most of that industry clout has been due to its collaborations, like the ones with streetwear brands such as Alife or established houses like Balenciaga, in which the Platonic ideal of the classic Croc is reimagined by a high-profile creative director. And the rest of it overlaps with the fact that, somehow, hideous sandals in general are in vogue. Crocs themselves aren’t responsible for the confounding relevance of footwear like Birkenstocks and Tevas over the past five-plus years. The Crocs we know today have been around for more than a decade; their existence just happened to overlap with the fact that suddenly, their particular brand of ugly is on trend. And with its new collection, Crocs is actively chasing the customer who probably already owns an ironic pair (or a few). Brand employees told me they even have a special name for him (he’s a dude): the “explorer,” the hypebeast-adjacent Gen Zer who stores his Crocs next to his Yeezys. In an even more blatant teen-targeting move, on November 1, the brand announced a collab with rapper Post Malone. “We know this group is all about self-expression, which is why our spring 2019 collection features a bright, bold color palette, positive messaging, oversized logos and trend-right platform silhouettes,” explained Michelle Poole, senior vice president and chief product and merchandising officer of Crocs. Alongside the brand’s standard fare of flexible sandals, bedazzle-able clogs in a rainbow of shades, and dad-approved water shoes, the Crocs collection preview on October 30 featured certain styles that wouldn’t have looked out of place at, say, an Adidas store. There were minimalist slip-ons in sleek black-and-white combinations, a sneaker that looked almost like Allbirds but with techier fabric, and a rubbery slide with a millennial pink upper and a translucent red flatform. They’re shoes that pair well with current fashion: casual, streetwear-influenced clothing that’s relatively unflashy. The move is similar to what pretty much every other brand is doing, with the hope of attracting devoted customers that will be around for a long time (and especially when they start holding jobs with disposable incomes). Kodak, a camera company in an era when people already have cameras on their phones, is targeting teens obsessed with old-school analog technology with its collaboration with Forever 21. Formerly struggling fashion brands like Abercrombie and Delia’s have attempted rebrands to capture fresh Gen Z consumers who don’t remember when they were trendy the first time around. And Crocs’ courting of the cool teen appears to be working. In a recent survey conducted by the investment firm Piper Jaffray of about 8,600 teenagers, Crocs was ranked 13th in the “top footwear brand” category, up from 27th last year. It’s a statistic that’s clearly influenced by the larger trend of ugly shoes as status symbols, and of ironic fashion in general (which also explains the rise of brands like Vetements and Off-White). Even though most teens can’t afford to drop multiple hundreds on the versions peddled by other brands, they’re probably a lot more likely to spring for Crocs’ regular ol’ $30 to $40 versions. People are even creating their own imaginary brand collabs on places like YouTube, which has dozens of videos of people DIYing their concepts of Crocs by Supreme, Off-White, and Gucci. Sales of Crocs may be down from their 2014 high, but focusing on the cool-young-person market could help. And Crocs appears to be leaning in: “Our ‘explorer’ consumers play an important role in shaping our global product and marketing strategies,” added Poole. It’s hard to say how long ugly shoes will be cool — fashion is a pendulum, and trends tend to arrive as a backlash to whatever came before — but as long as teens are buying Crocs, it seems that Crocs will be giving them what they want.",https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/1/18043612/crocs-spring-2019-slides-platforms,,Vox

Not. One. Bit. That’s because Andreessen stuck his foot in his mouth late Tuesday night when, while philosophizing on Twitter, he compared Facebook’s Free Basics service in India to colonialism and suggested that Indians are setting themselves up for economic ruin by resisting Facebook’s “help.” The tweets were inappropriate, and a lot of people were quick to call him out. Andreessen, who joined Facebook’s board in 2008, has since deleted the original tweet (which you can read below) and apologized multiple times in his now famous tweetstorm style. Still, Facebook and Zuckerberg are quickly trying to distance themselves from the comments. In a post Wednesday afternoon, hours after a company spokesperson said that Facebook “strongly rejected” Andreessen’s comments, Zuckerberg wrote: “I found the comments deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all.” He continued: “Facebook stands for helping to connect people and giving them voice to shape their own future. But to shape the future we need to understand the past.” Zuckerberg has spent a lot of time and energy trying to bring Free Basics to India. It’s a pet project of his, and he made a public trip to India and hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Facebook headquarters in 2015. https://twitter.com/KurtWagner8/status/697496625074180096 Free Basics provides a set of Internet services, including Facebook, free of charge to users, but doesn’t provide access to everything on the Internet. Regulators and critics argue that it violates the concept of net neutrality, which is why it’s currently banned in the country. What’s particularly tough about Andreessen’s comments is that many Free Basics opponents believe that Facebook’s free Internet plan will stifle Indian innovation by promoting established, existing services instead of allowing local Indian services to grow. The thinking is that Free Basics will allow an American gatekeeper (Facebook) to pick the winners and losers. Here’s Andreessen’s original tweet that sparked all the outrage.

Given how tense the nuclear standoff between the US and North Korea has gotten in recent months, many fear that North Korea might try to disrupt the games with an attack or other provocative behavior like a nuclear test. To try to avoid that outcome, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, is pushing the US to postpone its annual joint military drills with South Korea until after the Olympics. The US and South Korea hold joint military drills every spring to maintain readiness in case of potential war with North Korea and to demonstrate their military strength and resolve. One of the biggest is “Foal Eagle,” which this past year included around 30,000 US and South Korean troops who jointly practiced air, sea, and special operations from March to April. North Korea usually perceives these exercises as preparation for an invasion, and usually responds pretty harshly every time. South Korea is rightly worried about what North Korea could do before or during the Olympics, since Pyongyang already has a deadly track record. In 1987, North Korean agents bombed Korean Airlines Flight 858, killing all 115 people onboard. The attack was meant to deter attendees at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. But if President Donald Trump were to accept Moon’s offer, it’s entirely possible that North Korea would see the move as a sign of good faith and decide not to take any action around the Olympics to reignite tensions. China and North Korea consistently have advocated for a “freeze for freeze” plan, in which Pyongyang would stop improving its nuclear and missile programs if the US and South Korea — and potentially Japan — stopped conducting military exercises together. Trump, however, has consistently rejected that proposal. Retired Lt. Gen. Chip Gregson, the Pentagon’s top Asia official from 2009 to 2011, is also skeptical of Moon’s suggestion. “What does North Korea do in return?” he told me in an interview. “If it is nothing worthwhile, then it is not a good idea to preemptively compromise in the hope that it will somehow cause a change in North Korea’s actions. We would be extending an olive branch in response to North Korean and Chinese intimidation.” A Pentagon spokesperson declined to say if there are currently plans to pause the upcoming drills with South Korea, saying only that “it would be inappropriate to discuss plans for future exercises at this time.” In the Tuesday interview with NBC News, South Korean president Moon said, “I hope that this Olympics will be able to promote the peace between the North and South Korea and become an Olympics for peace.” Whether Trump, who so far hasn’t shown much willingness to deescalate tensions with North Korea, is willing to help Moon make that happen remains to be seen.",https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16800484/north-korea-trump-olympics-moon-south,,Vox
473,473,26-11-18 16:25,2018,11,26,Dylan Scott,Midterm elections 2018 live results: the House seats Democrats flipped,"Democrats have won the 23 House seats they needed for a House majority — and then some, as they continue to score victories in districts represented by Republican members of Congress. Even a week after Election Day, Democrats are still racking up wins as votes get counted and close races are called. The House battlefield was huge: Election forecasters considered more than 100 House elections to be competitive in the 2018 midterms, the vast majority of them held by the GOP. Democrats were buoyed by the backlash to President Donald Trump and a campaign focused on protecting Obamacare’s protections for people with preexisting conditions after the Republican effort to repeal the law last year. Once the results began rolling in, it was clear Democrats were quickly winning Republican-held House seats. So far, Democrats have won 41 GOP-held seats for a net gain of 39 seats, more than the 23 they needed to take control of Congress. Democrats have lost two seats they previously held — one in Minnesota and one in Pennsylvania — but they still cruised to a new House majority. They could end up picking up 40 seats when it’s all said and done, with a few races yet to be called. You can see all the results here, and we’re tracking the Democratic gains here: Barbara Comstock always looked like one of the most vulnerable House Republicans, after Hillary Clinton won her district by 10 points in 2016. The race was called quickly for Democrats on election night. Democrats worried at one time about Donna Shalala’s candidacy, but her momentum won out. Democrats were widely expected to flip this seat after Pennsylvania’s court-mandated redistricting. This was an open seat vacated by former Rep. Patrick Meehan, who resigned from the House amid sexual assault allegations. Democrat candidate Susan Wild defeated Republican candidate Marty Nothstein. Mike Coffman always seemed likely to lose this moderate suburban district in an election environment favorable to Democrats. Hillary Clinton won the Sixth by 9 points. This race was weird thanks to redistricting — pitting two current Congress members against each other — but it still counts as a Democratic pickup. This is a big win for Democrats: Carlos Curbelo is one of the most moderate Republicans in the House, and Republicans liked their chances of holding on here even in a Democratic year. A solid win for Democrats in the Great Plains, in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 1 point. Sharice Davids is the first Native American woman elected to the House. Top House Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen retired rather than defend this seat, and now Democrats have won it. Democrats snag one of two House pickup opportunities in the Land of 10,000 Lakes in a district Hillary Clinton won by 9. Scott Taylor’s campaign was ensnared in a voter fraud scandal, opening up an opportunity for Democrats that they took advantage of. Dan Donovan was the last Republican lawmaker representing a part of New York City in the House. His district voted for Trump by 9 points, but Max Rose, a combat vet, prevailed. Redistricting strikes again, handing Democrats an important win. Pete Sessions had risen high in the Republican conference, taking over the influential Rules Committee, but fell short in this Clinton +2 district. Sean Casten has defeated Peter Roskam, who served in the House since 2007. Hillary Clinton won the district by 7 points in 2016, but Roskam won his last reelection by nearly 20 points. Ann Kirkpatrick previously held Arizona’s First Congressional District. She won her race in the Republican-leaning Second Congressional District, vacated by Rep. Martha McSally (R), who is running for Senate. This district, northwest of Detroit, was previously held by retiring Republican Rep. Dave Trott. Democratic candidate Haley Stevens has now defeated Republican candidate Lena Epstein. This is a big pickup for Democrats; Antonio Delgado is a young African-American candidate who just won an overwhelmingly white district. House Republicans’ attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act became a huge point in the race. John Culberson has been in the House since 2001, but Democrats take this district that narrowly voted for Clinton. David Young has served in the US House since 2015. Health care and the GOP attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a huge issue in the race. Abby Finkenauer will become one of the youngest members of the House, elected at age 29. Randy Hultgren has served in the US House since 2011; he has been defeated by Lauren Underwood, a 32-year-old African American woman. Underwood is a registered nurse and former adviser to the Obama administration who helped implement the Affordable Care Act. Leonard Lance opposed the House’s Obamacare repeal bill, but it wasn’t enough to save him. Jason Lewis, who once lamented on his radio show that men could no longer call women “sluts,” loses to a woman in the Year of the Woman. Kendra Horn’s victory is maybe the biggest upset of election night so far: Trump won this district by 13 points and election forecasters thought it was a Likely Republican win. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative, unseated Dave Brat, a star among conservatives who four years ago unexpectedly dethroned then-House majority leader Eric Cantor. This seat, replacing retiring Rep. Frank LoBiondo, was one that Democrats were hoping to pick up. Jeff Van Drew won in a dramatic swing from 2016, when LoBiondo was reelected by a 22-point margin. Seth Grossman lost the support of national Republicans earlier this year over his history of racist comments and white nationalist sympathies. This is a big win for Democrats in the district of Republican Rep. Mark Sanford, who lost his primary to Katie Arrington, a more pro-Trump candidate, earlier this year. Joe Cunningham’s victory is the first time Democrats have flipped a House seat in South Carolina since 1986, according to the Post and Courier. It’s another big swing from 2016, when Sanford won by a 25-point margin. This was expected: Darrell Issa retired rather than defend his old seat, which Clinton won by 7 points in 2016. Katie Hill is one of the most notable wins in the Year of the Woman: Steve Knight was a fierce abortion opponent, and a target of abortion rights groups, while the Democrat spoke openly about her own unplanned pregnancy. Dana Rohrabacher — the lawmaker once dubbed Putin’s favorite congressman, who swore he could never lose reelection — fell to his Democratic challenger, Harley Rouda. Lucy McBath, who is black, suffered the loss of her son in 2012 when he was shot by a white man. She’ll soon be sworn in as the next representative of Georgia’s Sixth District. This is also a bit of redemption for Democrats, after Jon Ossoff narrowly lost to Republican Karen Handel in the 2017 special election to replace Tom Price. Republican Rep. Dave Reichert decided to retire rather than run for reelection in this Hillary Clinton district, and Kim Schrier will join the record number of Democratic women in Congress next year. Media outlets have called this race for Xochitl Torres Small, even as Republican Yvette Herrell rails on Fox News against the vote count. The Democrat, a former aide to Sen. Tom Udall, will be one of the younger members of the new Democratic majority; she’ll be 34 when she’s sworn in. Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur was critical to the House’s Obamacare repeal efforts, forging a compromise with the archconservative Freedom Caucus to roll back the health care law’s rules protecting preexisting conditions. Kim, who hammered MacArthur as one of the authors of repeal, is a former Obama administration official and he will become the first Korean-American Democrat to come to Congress. Denham was a more moderate Republican, willing to speak up against his party on issues like immigration. But he also voted for Obamacare repeal and the tax bill in a district Hillary Clinton won by 3 points. That proved to be his undoing against Harder, a political neophyte. In a razor-thin race, Porter — a UC-Irvine law professor who has focused on consumer protections for bankruptcy, worked under Elizabeth Warren, and endorsed Medicare-for-all — edged out Walters in a district that had never before elected a Democrat. Another open Republican-held California seat that Democrats will now represent. Kim led through most of the vote counting, but Cisneros, a Navy veteran, pulled ahead at the end. The headline is that veteran Jared Golden beat Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin, but the real excitement was Maine’s ranked-choice voting system. The state has instituted a new way of voting. When voters step into the ballot box, they rank the candidates. If no candidate gets 50 percent of first-place votes, then ranked-choice kicks in. People who voted for the candidates who received the fewest votes have their second-choice votes distributed among the top two candidates (and then the third, and the fourth, if need be) until one candidate hits 50 percent. Poliquin was actually leading after Election Day but didn’t reach 50 percent. And once the spreadsheets were run with the ranked-choice votes, Golden pulled out the win. When it’s all said and done, this might end up being the closest House race of 2018. The two candidates traded leads as mail-in and provisional ballots were counted. In the end, McAdams, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake County, beat first-term Rep. Love by fewer than 700 votes. This district swung heavily toward Trump — Mitt Romney won it by less than 1 point; Trump won it by 16 — to help put Tenney in Congress, but there was a fierce rebound in 2018 to land Brindisi, a state assemblyman and native of the Utica area, in the House.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18070396/midterm-elections-2018-live-results-house-seats-flip,,Vox
474,474,18-01-18 18:30,2018,1,18,"Mike Pearl, Lia Kantrowitz",Trump's Year of Living Dangerously with North Korea," This article is part of a weeklong series looking back at the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign, North Korea barely came up. The reality TV star didn't spend too much time on foreign policy—or any policy, really—and in his big ""America First"" campaign speech in April 2016 that covered global politics he mentioned North Korea only as a problem the US needed to pressure China into solving. Back then, ""America First"" sounded like old-fashioned isolationism, or maybe even some sort of mercantilism. In any case, it didn't seem like a President Trump would get the US into new wars. The idea that Trump would forgo international adventures and focus on a domestic agenda has long since gone up in smoke. Hawks in the White House seem to be itching for direct conflict with Iran. Trump has expanded the US military presence in Afghanistan. The use of Special Operations Forces remains on the rise. Most terrifying of all, it seems like every day there's a new sign that an all-out return to war with North Korea is on its way. North Korea was always going to be a major problem for Trump—Barack Obama explicitly warned his successor about the danger the nuclear-armed nation poised. Throughout the first year of Trump's presidency, North Korea continued to develop an arsenal that could wipe out US cities at the push of a button. Of particular interest were the detonation in September of a possible H-bomb—a huge leap in terms of sheer nuclear kilotonnage—as well as November's maiden voyage of the impressive Hwasong-15 missile, which looks like it could place a warhead anywhere in the US.  Every step North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has taken into the nuclear big leagues has been met by a provocation from Trump. In August he did some off-the-cuff saber-rattling—the famous ""fire and fury"" line—that scared seemingly everyone except Kim Jong-un, and in September, he gave Kim a cute nickname that he got either from an Elton John song or from a line Nicolas Cage said in The Rock. In this atmosphere, war with North Korea—once unthinkable because of the massive civilian casualties in Korea and Japan that would result—has become a topic of open conversation. ""It's Time to Bomb North Korea,"" read one provocative headline in Foreign Policy this month. (The article below it, a sadistic op-ed by Edward Luttwak, argued that if the Seoul area sustained heavy civilian casualties during a US-led war, that would simply be their nation's comeuppance years of poor planning.) Rodger Baker, who analyzes the Korean Peninsula for the military intelligence firm Statfor, thinks war is still not imminent. For the US, ""it still seems like overall, the cost of military action continues to outweigh the benefit,"" he told me in a phone interview, adding that ""the North Koreans don’t want war."" Last month's bilateral talks between North and South Korea have been a tangible sign that movement in the direction of something other than war is not inconceivable. The takeaways from those talks have, so far, centered on the decision by the two nations to march together in the Winter Olympics, but that's more than nothing. According to Baker, Trump could have been a factor in the two countries' decision to chat. ""He certainly contributed to the factors that led the North Koreans to have this dialogue with the South at this time,"" Baker told me, though he hastened to add that the timing also ""matches where the North Koreans are in their program""—so it's entirely possible that we'd be seeing talks like these no matter who was sitting in the White House.  The latter view is the perspective of Karl Friedhoff, a foreign policy fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who formerly worked as a public opinion pollster in South Korea. ""It was essentially preordained that North Korea was going to being to play nice right before the Olympics,"" Friedhoff told me, adding, ""I don’t think [Trump] was responsible in any way shape or form for this coming together."" Friedhoff perceives the broad strokes of Trump's North Korea plan as nothing new. What Trump is doing is presenting a credible military threat, just as past presidents have done, hoping sanctions actually hurt the regime, and then, once the medicine has done its work, eventually ""bringing North Korea back to the table."" The difference this time, according to Friedhoff: ""Now we have a president who is relatively erratic in his behavior. One day he’ll make fire and fury comments, and the next he’ll come out and say, We need to have negotiations and talks! We can talk anywhere and anytime!”  On many foreign policy issues, Trump's ideological compass seems to spin around like a propeller. His own most ardent fans, many of whom believed he would be a less interventionist president than Obama, watched in horror as he lobbed missiles at Syria last April and cozied up to Saudi Arabia in May. He hasn't been as soft on Russia as many of his opponents feared, but he's spent his first year alarming traditional American allies with his rhetoric, threatening to leave NAFTA, gutting the State Department, and causing international incidents for no reason—most recently when he reportedly called all of Africa a ""shithole."" Through it all, however, Trump's perspective on the two regimes that have been America's most persistent antagonists—North Korea and Iran—has never really changed. Trump’s clearest foreign policy program has been a bifurcated effort aimed, apparently, at deepening tensions with the two countries. But while Trump appears poised to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran and could ratchet up hostilities against it, the prospect of war with North Korea is the thing really keeping Americans scared of their own shadows. Unlike Iran, North Korea has nuclear weapons and potentially the capability to use them against the US, creating one of the most delicate, high-stakes geopolitical situations in the world. A report in the New York Times on Sunday painted a bleak picture of an unenthused US military glumly proceeding with the march toward war with North Korea, conducting exercises that simulate combat conditions. But Baker says we might not want to read too much into that. ""We’ve known about these trainings for months and months,"" he explained. He told me their emergence in the news cycle right now makes sense. ""My guess is that the [US] government is sort of intentionally letting these stories come out now, just as a reminder that the inter-Korean talks don’t mean the US is stopping its [war] preparation."" Some analysts have speculated that with Trump watching from the sidelines, those aforementioned inter-Korean talks could exacerbate squabbles between South Korea and the US. Baker didn't seem too worried about that either. Yes, North Korea could certainly try to whisper dreams about a wonderful America-free future into South Korean President Moon Jae-In's ear, but that's not likely to get them very far. ""At this phase, it’s hard to see what would potentially undermine US strength that wouldn’t, in the immediate [term], also undermine South Korea’s own national security,"" Baker said. So the question remains: Is there some uniquely Trumpian flourish to the North Korean deal-making process? Something no other president would have the gold-plated cojones to try? ""The rumor is that there’s there’s a trade war looming with China, which, if it’s carried out, will have an impact on what China is willing to do with North Korea as well,"" Friedhoff told me.  On Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was in Vancouver to talk to a crew of representatives from all the nations that were allied with the US during the Korean War. The move, Baker told me, was designed to create, ""a pseudo legitimate entity."" But the summit pissed off China, which was excluded from the talks, and Russia, another excluded party, which condemned the talks as harkening back to an ""inappropriate Cold War mindset."" According to Baker, here's how this new source of pressure is meant to work: These talks are designed ""to let the Chinese know that the US has alternatives to the United Nations Security Council."" While this may not be a formal meeting of the UN, it is, ""a United Nations thing,"" and while the UN Security Council can't seem to agree that North Korea is a ""belligerent"" (perhaps because that council includes Russia and China), this group definitely does. ""Obviously these days China and Russia are not acting as if North Korea is a belligerent,"" and this meeting is a way of saying that needs to change, Baker said. In the longer term, the big question is whether the US will decide that coexisting with a nuclear North Korea is anything other than a total nonstarter. If the US can eventually shift from the position absolutely no nukes ever or we'll never talk to you, and into what Baker calls ""a long-term containment strategy,"" then, he said, ""there is a lot of room for dialogue."" Will Trump decide to make that shift, backing away from his months of angry tweets? I don't think anyone in the world—maybe not even Trump himself—has any idea.

As a 16-year-old in 2011, the Chicago rapper's rise changed the genre's sound, inspiring artists outside of the city to adopt drill elements in their own music. If you've heard someone scream ""gang gang,"" ""bang bang,"" or ""squad,"" they likely got that from him. Most videos from street artists at this point are direct products of his ""Don't Like"" video, which was mostly shot in one room with his friends behind him toting heavy artillery.  But even with his influence being so evident on the genre, Keef has granted a very limited amount of people access to his life and artistic process, especially after being dropped from Interscope Records in 2014. Lucky for us, Keef has broken his silence and in a new interview with XXL, he spoke about his influence, getting offered to be Apple Music's first signee, and his recording process. Of Apple Music's attempt to acquire him, he said: Apple Music's head of content, Larry Jackson, who recruited Keef to Interscope, confirmed that he did make the offer but didn't expect the rapper to bite. When asked about his feelings towards artists like Lil Yachty, Lil Uzi Vert, and other newcomers, Keef said:  Keef also talked about his new music and direction, sharing that he likes playing with en vogue afrobeats and dancehall vibes, as he did on recently released ""Can You Be My Friend.""

But by Monday, we got a clearer reason why that might be.  ""The reason we're not working on Rick and Morty right now ain't because I figured out that I don't need to impress you,"" Harmon said on Kevin Smith's SModcast over the weekend. ""It's because of a little something called contract negotiations and it's gotten complicated this time around."" In previous inter-season interviews, Harmon would say he and co-creator Justin Roiland were taking their time to ensure the show stayed up to par for its rabid fanbase. But this time around, that rhetoric seems to have been replaced by frustration at the Turner Broadcasting executives in charge of their contracts.  The duo certainly has a lot of leverage and could always walk away from giving Adult Swim another ratings-busting season of the show. Roiland is currently pouring his voice acting talents and explosive visual imagination into virtual reality game company Squanch Games, which just announced a new title called Dr. Splorchy. Last year, Harmon executive produced a series for fledgling streaming service YouTube Red, which would likely pay top dollar for his writing skills and fanbase. Meanwhile, Adult Swim has been squeezing every last drop of Rick and Morty secret sauce into marketing for artists it represents and its new festival in LA.

Washington (AFP) - President Barack Obama said Friday he had confronted Vladimir Putin in person over allegations of Russian hacking when they met ahead of the US election, telling him to ""cut it out."" After being alerted over the summer to Russian cyber attacks on the Democratic Party, Obama told a year-end news conference his chief concern was to ensure the hacking did not escalate and hamper the vote counting last month. ""In early September when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't,"" Obama said. ""And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process,"" he added. Just five weeks before he leaves the White House, the outgoing president has vowed to retaliate against Moscow over the cyber-meddling, which US intelligence says was designed to help Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, a Putin critic. ""Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you,"" warned the US president. Obama said there also was ""some evidence"" of China curbing cyber espionage in response to US warnings. ""I had to have the same conversation with President Xi (Jinping) and what we've seen is some evidence that they have reduced but not completely eliminated these activities,"" the US leader said. Obama's traditional year-end press conference -- held as tensions soar with Russia -- was expected to be closely watched by his elected successor Trump, who has pledged to foster closer ties with the Kremlin. While Obama has not directly named Putin over the election hacking, one of his top advisors, Ben Rhodes, said Thursday: ""I don't think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it."" Meanwhile US officials said a Chinese warship had seized a US underwater drone in the South China Sea, triggering a formal diplomatic protest. The Global Times cited a Chinese military source as saying Beijing believed the incident involving the U.S. drone would be resolved ""smoothly.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/afp-cut-it-out-obama-told-putin-on-cyber-attacks-2016-12,,Business Insider
479,479,21-03-18 00:00,2018,3,21,,What are the links between Cambridge Analytica and a Brexit campaign group?,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica lies at the center of a storm for using data obtained from millions of Facebook users without their permission after it was hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.   However, the analytics firm is also under scrutiny over campaigning for the 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the European Union.  Cambridge Analytica and the leaders of the Leave.EU group have previously boasted about working together during the Brexit campaign. However, they have since retracted their claims, saying no contract was signed and no work was completed.   Parliament is investigating the links between Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU as part of an investigation into fake news.     Did Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU work together?  Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU, said in a book that in October 2015 his group hired Cambridge Analytica, a company that uses “big data and advanced psychographics” to influence people. In a November 2015, Leave.EU said on its website that Cambridge Analytica “will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in, enabling us to better engage with voters”.  In the same month, Cambridge Analytica director Brittany Kaiser spoke at a Leave.EU news conference. She said her organization would be “running large-scale research of the nation to really understand why people are interested in staying in or out of the EU”.  In February 2016, Cambridge Analytica chief executive  Alexander Nix wrote in Campaign magazine that his company was working for Leave.EU. “We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU’s social media campaign by ensuring the right messages are getting to the right voters online,” said Nix, who was suspended by the company this week.  Leave.EU’s communications director Andy Wigmore also said on Twitter last year that his campaign group had used the company. “You should use Cambridge Analytics,” he said, adding that he could “highly recommend them”.  What does Leave.EU say now?  Banks says Cambridge Analytica sought work with the Leave.EU before the referendum but that ultimately it never did any - paid or otherwise - for the campaign.  “We did have dealings with Cambridge Analytica – they put forward a pitch that went into the designation document submitted to the electoral commission,” Banks told Reuters.  No work was done with Cambridge Analytica because Leave.EU did not win the designation as the official leave campaign and due to concerns about the consultancy, Banks said.  When asked if Leave.EU paid or accepted any services from Cambridge Analytica, Banks said: “No benefit in kind, no data, no nothing.”  Banks told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that when he referred to Cambridge Analytica being “hired” in his book this was a reference to the intention to work them.  What does Cambridge Analytica say now?  Nix told a parliamentary committee last month that he contacted Banks and Wigmore and their statements were not true.  The article written in the Campaign magazine was a mistake and “drafted by a slightly overzealous PR consultant”, he said.   This “referenced work that we hoped and intended to undertake for the campaign. Subsequently, work was never undertaken. The moment that that statement went out we were absolutely crystal clear to all the media outlets that we were not involved and that it had been released in error,” he said.

480,480,07-04-18 00:00,2018,4,7,"Dahlia Nehme, Roberta Rampton",Trump says 'big price to pay' for Syria chemical attack,"BEIRUT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Sunday there would be a “big price to pay” after aid groups said dozens of people were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town in Syria, an attack the opposition blamed on Syrian government forces.  As international officials worked to try to confirm the chemical attack which happened late on Saturday in the town of Douma, Trump took the rare step of directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in connection with the incident.  With tension running high, Syrian state television later issued a report of a suspected U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, prompting a swift U.S. denial of any such attack.  The Syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical assault. Russia, President Bashar al-Assad’s most powerful ally, called the reports fake.  Trump threatened action, although it was unclear what he had in mind. Last year, he authorized a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base days after a sarin gas attack on civilians.   “Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay,” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The Russian Foreign Ministry warned against military action on the basis of “invented and fabricated excuses.”  The medical relief organization Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) and the civil defense service, which operates in rebel-held areas, said in a joint statement 49 people died in the attack.  “Yesterday reports emerged of yet another chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime,” said the Syrian Negotiation Committee, a political opposition group.  U.S. government sources said Washington’s assessment was that chemical weapons were used in a besieged rebel-held town in Syria, but they are still evaluating details.  The European Union also said evidence pointed to the use of chemical weapons by Assad’s forces.    A European diplomat said Western allies would work on building a dossier based on photos, videos, witness testimony and satellite images of Syrian flights and helicopters. However gaining access to samples on the ground would be difficult.   The U.N. Security Council will meet twice on Monday following rival requests by Russia and the United States.  U.N. war crimes investigators had previously documented 33 chemical attacks in Syria, attributing 27 to the Assad government, which has repeatedly denied using the weapons.  Russia has repeatedly blocked efforts to hold Syria accountable both at the U.N. and OPCW.      In the early hours of Monday, Syrian state television reported loud explosions heard near the T-4 airfield in the city of Homs in what it said was a suspected U.S. missile strike. The report ignited a storm of messages on Twitter.  The Pentagon denied any such attack.  “At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting air strikes in Syria,” the Pentagon said in a statement.  “However, we continue to closely watch the situation and support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to hold those who use chemical weapons, in Syria and otherwise, accountable.”  Last week, Trump said he wanted to bring home the 2,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Syria working to help fight Islamic State militants. His advisers have urged him to wait to ensure the militants are defeated and to prevent Assad’s ally Iran from gaining a foothold.  Republican U.S. Senator John McCain said Assad was “emboldened” after Trump’s remarks and said the U.S. president now needed to respond decisively.  Tom Bossert, Trump’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, told  ABC’s “This Week” the White House would not rule out launching another missile attack and called photos of the incident “horrible.”  One video of the new attack shared by activists showed bodies of about a dozen children, women and men, some with foam at the mouth. “Douma city, April 7 ... there is a strong smell here,” a voice can be heard saying.  Reuters could not independently verify the reports.  Last year, one factor in Trump’s decision to bomb Syria was televised images of dead children.  Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump would likely await a conclusive “high confidence” intelligence assessment that the government used chemical weapons.  The presence of Russian forces at a number of Syrian military bases complicates the process of picking targets for any strike, said one official.  While some in the administration believe Russian forces should not be considered immune to attack because of Moscow’s support for Assad, officials said Putin would see any loss of Russian lives or equipment as a deliberate escalation, and likely would respond by increasing support for Assad, or retaliating in other ways.  Trump had a previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Monday with senior military leaders. He has shaken up his core national security team, replacing national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, a hard-charging former U.N. ambassador, who officially begins on Monday.  Bolton last year praised Trump’s missile response, though he has generally focused more on Iran as a bigger security threat.  Top White House officials were uncertain what advice Bolton may have given Trump about Syria, said a U.S. official.  However, two officials said Trump has been adamant about withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria, despite warnings about the consequences from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other military officials.  The Ghouta offensive has been one of the deadliest in Syria’s seven-year-long war, killing more than 1,600 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  The monitoring group said it could not confirm whether chemical weapons had been used in the attack on Saturday.  Medical relief organization SAMS said a chlorine bomb hit Douma hospital, killing six, and a second attack with “mixed agents”, including nerve agents, had hit a nearby building.  Basel Termanini, the U.S.-based vice president of SAMS, told Reuters another 35 people, most of them women and children, had been killed at a nearby apartment building.  SAMS and the civil defense said medical centers had taken in more than 500 people suffering breathing difficulties, frothing from the mouth and smelling of chlorine.  Tawfik Chamaa, a Geneva-based Syrian doctor with the Syria-focused Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a network of Syrian doctors, said 150 people were confirmed dead and the number was growing. “The majority were civilians, women and children trapped in underground shelters,” he told Reuters.       Douma is in the eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. Assad has won back control of nearly all of eastern Ghouta from rebel groups in a Russian-backed military campaign that began in February, leaving just Douma in rebel hands.  Facing defeat, rebel groups elsewhere in eastern Ghouta have left. Until now, the prominent insurgent group Jaish al-Islam has rejected that option, but the attack led the group to finally give in to the government’s demand to leave.

482,482,10-06-19 00:00,2019,6,10,Philip Pullella,Vatican condemns gender theory as bid to destroy nature,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican condemned gender theory on Monday as part of a “confused concept of freedom”, saying in a new document that the idea of gender being determined by personal feeling rather than biology was an attempt to “annihilate nature”.  LGBT rights advocates denounced the 30-page document, called “Male and Female He Created Them”, as harmful and confusing, saying it would encourage hatred and bigotry.  The document, the Vatican’s first on gender theory, was written by the Congregation for Catholic Education as an “instruction” to Catholic educators on how to address the topic of gender theory in line with Church teaching.  It was released as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people around the world have been celebrating “Pride Month” amid a surge in demands for acceptance of the idea that gender is more complex and fluid than the binary categories of male and female, and depends on more than visible sex characteristics.  “The concept of gender is seen as dependent upon the subjective mindset of each person, who can choose a gender not corresponding to his or her biological sex, and therefore with the way others see that person,” the Vatican booklet says.  It says gender theories are “often founded on nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants, or momentary desires provoked by emotional impulses and the will of the individual, as opposed to anything based on the truths of existence”.  Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, which seeks to reconcile LGBT Catholics and the institutional Church, called the booklet “a gross misrepresentation” of the lives of LGBT people that could encourage violence against them.  “The misinformation the document contains will cause families to reject their children, and it will increase alienation of LGBT people from the Church,” he said in a statement.  While the document is not signed by Pope Francis, it several times quotes from his speeches and teachings and those of previous popes. It was issued with little advance notice to reporters and without the customary news conference.  It denounced theories that attempted to “annihilate the concept of nature” and “educational programs and legislative trends that ... make a radical break with the actual biological difference between male and female”.  A prominent American Jesuit writer, Father James Martin, tweeted: “The document is mainly a dialogue with philosophers and theologians, and with other church documents; but not with scientists and biologists, not with psychologists, and certainly not with LGBT people, whose experiences are given little if any weight.”  DeBernardo added: People do not choose their gender, as the Vatican claims: they discover it through their lived experiences. The Church should respect and encourage this process of discovery, because it is a process by which individuals discover the wonderful way that God has created them.”  Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Kevin Liffey",https://www.reuters.com/article/vatican-gender/vatican-condemns-gender-theory-as-bid-to-destroy-nature-idUSL8N23H3MQ,World News,Reuters
483,483,07-10-18 00:00,2018,10,7,"Tom Allard, Kanupriya Kapoor","Indonesia's fickle quake spares some, destroys others at epicenter","LENDE INDUK, Indonesia (Reuters) - Just 500 meters from the epicenter of the earthquake that triggered a wave of destruction in Indonesia, a modest wooden home built on hollow concrete foundations in Lende Induk village stands completely and remarkably unscathed.  A few kilometers away, along the main road of its sister village, Lende Tovea, scores of  homes - many built with reinforced concrete - were completely destroyed by the violent shaking, leaving a mess of rubble neatly covered by fallen tin roofs.  The contrasting scene in the hamlets nestled between the coast and lush hills visited by Reuters on Saturday illustrate the fickle effects of the major 7.5 magnitude quake and ensuing tsunami that battered Palu, a coastal city 78 km (48 miles) to the south, on Sept. 28.  More than 66,000 buildings were badly damaged and at least 1,649 people were killed in the disaster but neither the quality of building construction nor proximity to the quake explain why some areas were destroyed and others nearby left relatively untouched.  Zainar, 38, who lives in the intact house closest to the epicenter, was inside when the quake struck.  While the house built a year ago held strong, she said everything inside was broken.  “There was a monstrous shaking and everything inside fell over. We can’t use anything,” Zainar told Reuters.   “Luckily, by the grace of God, our house didn’t collapse. I don’t know why,” she said.  Mudrik Rahmawan Daryono, an earthquake expert from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences who did his doctorate on the geology around Palu, said an unusual web of fault lines that intersect the area helped explain the discrepancies.  There are four main interconnected fault lines active in the area and a multitude of smaller ones that radiate from them.  The immense energy created by the slippage of the tectonic plates underneath Lende Induk tracked the ruptures.  “It is clear based on the satellite image that one of the major fault lines, the Palu segment, is responsible for the quake,” he said. “It goes through the city and the sea.”  He said earthquakes cause greater damage where the soil is softer with higher saturation levels from groundwater.  At its extreme during powerful quakes, the soft, wet soil produces liquefaction, turning the ground into a roiling, muddy liquid.  In Balaroa and Petobo, two sub-districts in the south of Palu hit by extensive liquefaction, hundreds of people were killed and countless homes destroyed, many sucked into the churning quagmire.  Rescuers retrieved dozens of bodies from the areas at the weekend. Many victims are believed to be buried under meters of mud and debris.  The imam of Lende Tovea, Launi, knows little of seismology but has been pondering the fickle disaster.  He was inside his mosque along with the village chief, Rahman Lakuaci, listening to the call to prayer by the muezzin, Darwis, when the earthquake struck.   Within five seconds of the first impact, Lakuaci said the mosque collapsed. Lakuaci escaped but Iman Launi was trapped inside, rescued by villagers four hours later.  Darwis was killed instantly, one of dozens in the area Lakuaci believes perished. He said 70 percent of homes had collapsed.  Sitting under a tarpaulin in front of his obliterated home, a mangle of shattered timber and broken concrete surrounding an immaculately intact green cupboard, the imam said shocked worshippers had questioned him about the quake.  “I tell them this is a test from God,” he said, smiling congenially.   “I say ‘don’t let this shake your faith. It’s troubles like these that bring us closer to God’.”  Editing by Robert Birsel and Paul Tait",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-quake-epicentre/indonesias-fickle-quake-spares-some-destroys-others-at-epicenter-idUSKCN1MH06N,World News,Reuters
484,484,17-05-18 01:47,2018,5,17,Jen Kirby,Report: official leaked Michael Cohen’s financial transactions because of fears over missing records,"Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels’s attorney, published a memo last week that he said detailed Michael Cohen’s financial transactions. The “Project Sunlight” memo revealed Cohen’s firm Essential Consultants LLC had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from major corporations, including a $500,000 payment from a company with ties to a Russian oligarch. Various companies that paid Cohen, Donald Trump’s personal attorney, for amorphous consulting services — AT&T and Novartis among them — confirmed the payments. The admissions corroborated Avenatti’s revelations. But questions arose about how Avenatti had obtained the confidential information, especially as he referenced “3 Suspicious Activity Reports” related to Cohen’s dealings and teased more significant disclosures to come. The Treasury Department launched an inquiry into the potential leak. Reporting by the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow answers that question. A law enforcement official leaked the documents, the official told Farrow, after becoming concerned that two reports on Cohen’s suspicious financial activity could not be found in a government database. Both of those reports, according to the New Yorker, detail even more substantial financial transactions — about $3 million, three times the amount of last week’s disclosures. This is an extraordinary allegation. This whistleblower is claiming the documents went missing from the database, the more sinister — but so far unverifiable — implication being that they were purposely being withheld. The documents this law enforcement official said they could not find are not easily misplaced bureaucratic paperwork. Suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are reports that banks and other financial institutions file if they have an inkling that someone might be engaging in money laundering or another illicit activity. They are filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which maintains a database for government and law enforcement officials. A suspicious activity report is not proof of any crime, just a red flag, and can help authorities establish patterns. “I have never seen something pulled off the system. ... That system is a safeguard for the bank,” the source told the New Yorker. “It’s a stockpile of information. When something’s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.” Some former government officials suggested to the New Yorker that it’s possible (though it would be unusual) that access is restricted because of the extremely sensitive nature of the SARs, given that Cohen is under federal investigation by the Manhattan US attorney’s office. That investigation, while apparently separate from special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by Mueller’s office. A FinCEN spokesperson confirmed Thursday to the Wall Street Journal that the agency does limit access to SARs at the request of law enforcement if there’s an open investigation. New statement from FinCEN spox - it does limit access to SARs in ongoing investigations pic.twitter.com/aoeAwggB34 The statement from FinCEN seems to clamp down on the more alarming possibility of foul play while underscoring how delicate the matter into Cohen might be. FinCEN also reiterated that the Treasury inspector general is still investigating the disclosure of the one SAR document, which is a federal criminal offense. There are reportedly three SARs related to Cohen filed by First Republic Bank by January 2018, where Cohen opened an account for Essential Consultants. Cohen set up Essential Consultants to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money days before the 2016 election to silence her about a 2006 affair she says she had with Trump. Avenatti’s disclosure last week revealed that Cohen had also been busy selling himself as an essential consultant in the Trump era, peddling his services to major corporations, including AT&T, Novartis, and a Korean aerospace firm, which took him up on his offer, and Ford and Uber, which did not. Among those payments was a $500,000 transaction from Columbus Nova, which has ties to a company belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. The information in that disclosure covers one of the SARs, from September 2017 to January 2018. The other two reports, which total $3 million, are the ones that the official allegedly couldn’t find in the database. A lot of that money ended up in Cohen’s personal coffers, which was flagged in a separate suspicious activity report by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Cohen deposited checks with the institution — two in the amount of $250,000 and one in the amount of $500,005. According to the New Yorker, “Morgan Stanley Smith Barney marked those transactions, which added up to more than a million dollars, as possible signs of ‘bribery or gratuity’ and ‘suspicious use of third-party transactors (straw-man).’” First Republic also seemed to think Cohen’s description of Essential Consultants didn’t match up with the financial transactions. As the New Yorker reports: In paperwork filed with the bank, he said that the company would be devoted to using “his experience in real estate to consult on commercial and residential” deals. Cohen told the bank that his transactions would be modest, and based within the United States. In fact, the compliance officers wrote, “a significant portion of the target account deposits continue to originate from entities that have no apparent connection to real estate or apparent need to engage Cohen as a real estate consultant.” Likewise, “a significant portion of the deposits continues to be derived from foreign entities.” The implications of the SARs — both the one released and the two others that reportedly exist — reveal, at best, that Cohen still has a lot of explaining to do. Mueller reportedly reached out to AT&T, Novartis, Ford, and other companies to ask questions last year about their relationship with Cohen. On Wednesday, the Washington Post confirmed that the FBI investigated payments Korea Aerospace Industries paid to Cohen, asking questions of its representatives “a few weeks ago.” It’s unclear if Mueller’s team or federal prosecutors in Manhattan followed up on those payments.

485,485,13-03-17 15:30,2017,3,13,German Lopez,A new video challenges the official story about what happened to Michael Brown in Ferguson,"A few seconds of video have reopened old wounds about police brutality in America. Over the weekend, documentary filmmaker Jason Pollock debuted his movie Stranger Fruit at SXSW, and with it previously unreleased surveillance footage of black teenager Michael Brown at a grocery store. The video shows Brown just hours before he was shot and killed by then–Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014. According to the filmmaker, the new video shows Brown walking into a store and exchanging marijuana with the clerk for cigarillos at about 1 am on August 9, 2014. But in the footage, Brown turns around and returns the cigarillos — presumably so the clerk can hold them until Brown comes back later. This footage was never released by police before. The video that was previously released by police, however, showed Brown at this exact same store around 11 hours later. But this time, Brown was shown strong-arming a clerk and getting away with a pack of cigarillos. Back in August 2014, police said the video proved Brown had robbed the store — which police and Wilson’s defenders used as evidence to argue that Wilson had reason to fear for his life when he shot and killed the teenager. The new video complicates the story by suggesting that Brown showed up at the store not to rob it, but to pick up his cigarillos as part of an ongoing consensual — if illegal — exchange. So it’s not so much that Brown took part in a robbery, but that a run-of-the-mill drug deal went wrong. The video has not been authenticated by media outlets, nor have local police verified its legitimacy or what it shows. It’s possible that it was edited or otherwise doctored. But it’s already led to protests in the Ferguson area, according to CNN. Still, the newly released video casts new questions on the Brown shooting case: Why wasn’t this video previously released by police but the other video was? Why did it take a documentary to force it into the light a few years later? And does this really mean anything for the actual shooting of Brown, given that the standards for use of force are so narrow and Wilson was already cleared after a grand jury decided not to indict him? In other words, nearly three years after Brown’s death, we are once again relitigating the shooting that elevated the massive Black Lives Matter movement over police brutality and the broader racial disparities in how cops use force. The new video raises two big questions about what happened hours before Brown was shot and killed. The first question: Did Brown really forcefully rob the store? The surveillance video that police originally released only seemed to show the end of Brown’s dealings with the store — particularly the moments where he pushed aside a staff member at the store who was trying to keep him from leaving. Police used that piece to make the case that Brown took part in a strong-arm robbery of the store just hours before the shooting. But the new video, again, suggests that Brown had a more consensual arrangement with the business. The store, for its part, has denied that it was participating in an illegal drug deal. “There was no transaction. There was no understanding. No agreement. Those folks didn’t sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back,” Jay Kanzler, attorney for Ferguson Market & Liquor, said in a statement. The second question: How could this new video not be relevant if the old one was? St. Louis County Police have said that incident in the video “is still irrelevant to our investigation because our department investigated the encounter between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson” — suggesting that they were focused on the moments of the shooting itself, not what happened before. But if that’s the case, why was the old surveillance video of the alleged robbery released in the first place? How was that old video relevant to the shooting if this newly released video isn’t? Pollock, the documentary filmmaker, said the selective withholding of the video evidence suggests an attempt at character assassination. “We had to do this so that people understand what really happened,” he told reporters. “Because people think all these ridiculous things about him — that he was a thug. And he was not a thug. He just graduated from high school in a place were there was only 62 percent graduation rate. That means he was a rock star, and he beat all the odds, and he was murdered eight days after his graduation.” Again, the video still needs to be authenticated. But whatever comes of it, all of this contributes to greater distrust in the police story. The Ferguson Police Department and St. Louis County police investigators have been mired in distrust from the start, with many people refusing to believe the official story of what happened in the moments around when Brown was shot and killed. If more people come to believe that the police were trying to selectively withhold evidence to hurt Brown’s reputation, that will only further worsen distrust in the police over what, exactly, happened in August 2014. The video alone, however, doesn’t show that Wilson wasn’t legally justified when he shot and killed Brown. Under the law, what’s relevant is that Wilson reasonably perceived a threat to himself or others in the moments when he shot and killed Brown. Wilson claimed that after he stopped Brown, the teenager tried to reach for his firearm and later charged at him when he fired the fatal shots. It is these last few moments that would be truly relevant to the shooting: If Wilson thought Brown was trying to hurt him, that would be enough for Wilson to reasonably perceive a threat and use force. Wilson also claimed that he believed Brown was a robbery suspect, based on a call he got moments before the shooting suggesting that Brown matched the description of a robbery suspect — which would bolster Wilson’s argument that he genuinely believed Brown posed a threat. But even the video might not be too relevant here, because Wilson wasn’t at the time aware of the newly or previously released footage. And, again, what matters is whether in the moment Wilson reasonably perceived a threat. A local grand jury, police, and the US Department of Justice have so far come down in Wilson’s favor. The physical evidence suggested Brown reached into Wilson’s car during their physical altercation and likely attempted to grab the officer’s gun. The most credible witnesses agreed that Brown moved toward Wilson before the officer fired his final shots. Although some credible witnesses suggested Brown raised his hands up before he died, witnesses who disputed major parts of Wilson’s side of the story were discredited by the physical evidence and when they changed their accounts. In the end, there simply wasn’t enough evidence, especially given the struggle at the car, that Wilson wasn’t justified in fearing for his life when he fired the shots that killed Brown. The video doesn’t change any of these details. So it’s likely not relevant to the criminal case against Wilson. Still, it may be ultimately relevant to the Brown family’s ongoing wrongful death lawsuit against Ferguson. While it’s unclear if the newly released video will alter the legal battles around the Brown shooting, there’s little doubt that it will worsen a very real crisis in policing: distrust in law enforcement. Consider that even though Wilson was never indicted, the Justice Department found that the Ferguson Police Department was racially biased and used to generate budget revenue instead of protecting the public. Essentially, local officials asked police to raise as much revenue as possible through fines and court fees, and Ferguson police carried out those orders by targeting the city’s poorer, less politically powerful black residents. This led to often frivolous police work, exemplified by one of the Justice Department’s findings: Officers frequently arrest individuals under Section 29-16(1) on facts that do not meet the provision’s elements. Section 29-16(1) makes it unlawful to “[f]ail to comply with the lawful order or request of a police officer in the discharge of the officer’s official duties where such failure interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance of such duties.” Many cases initiated under this provision begin with an officer ordering an individual to stop despite lacking objective indicia that the individual is engaged in wrongdoing. The order to stop is not a “lawful order” under those circumstances because the officer lacks reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. … Nonetheless, when individuals do not stop in those situations, FPD officers treat that conduct as a failure to comply with a lawful order, and make arrests. More broadly, there are massive racial disparities in police use of force. A previous analysis of the available FBI data by Dara Lind for Vox found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force. One possible explanation for the racial disparities: Police tend to patrol high-crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black. That means they’re going to be generally more likely to initiate a policing action, from traffic stops to more serious arrests, against a black person who lives in these areas. And all of these policing actions carry a chance, however small, of escalating into a violent confrontation. That’s not to say that higher crime rates in black communities explain the entire racial disparity in police shootings. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, “There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.” That suggests something else — such as, potentially, racial bias — is going on. At the same time, police are often missing when black communities need them most. Consider the clearance rate — the rate at which cases are solved — for murders and shootings in black communities. As David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, previously told Mother Jones, in minority communities, clearance rates for murders and nonfatal shootings can get “pathetically low. They can easily fall down to single digits.” Journalist Jill Leovy captured the sentiment this fosters in her award-winning book Ghettoside: “Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens.” Together, all of this feeds into the idea that police overpolice black communities by stopping and shooting black men for petty crimes and simultaneously underpolice the same communities for more serious crimes that actually require police help. And that crisis of confidence is why police are wrangling with movements like Black Lives Matter that think how America does policing is fundamentally broken and needs to be fixed — and why we’re still debating what happened the day Michael Brown was shot and killed.",https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/13/14905320/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting-video,,Vox
486,486,06-12-16 17:27,2016,12,6,Noisey UK Staff,Lock Mariah Carey Out of Your Home This Xmas,"This article originally appeared on Noisey UK. For too long, Christmas has been haunted by the glittering, damp spectre of routine. As family members sit around the table, it's likely some form of recognisable music will come tooting from the speakers. The work of Slade, Wham! and Mariah Carey, perhaps. Or the sound of ""Little Drummer Boy"", which is comparable to the emission of wind from the depths of the anus. These enduring compositions aren't completely terrible, but they're also as dusty as the decaying tinsel that gets dragged down from the attic each December. They speak of reindeers, fairytales and non-existent snowmen. They tell a tale of a ""White Christmas"" that only exists in Richard Curtis films and they very rarely involve existential despair or an impressive desire for drinking the house dry. In fact, the standard set of Christmas songs have become increasingly underwhelming to the point of nausea. Every radio station, music channel, work playlist, plays the same 50 on repeat, and you engage with them anyway, don't you, because what other choice do you have? They are like the last withered pie at Greggs, or a genuinely attractive person on Tinder who has set ""Panda"" as their anthem.  With that in mind, we're drawing a line in the fake snow and we're cleaning up the damn playlist. Here are a list of new-ish songs to listen to while inebriated and around your immediate family this festive season. This is the most iconic Christmas song of all time. I'm sorry Band Aid, I'm sorry The Pogues, I'm sorry Las Ketchup – who re-released ""The Ketchup Song"" with added sleigh bells in an attempt to pass it off as festive – but Gucci Mane has re-written history with this, the hardest Christmas single since East 17 stood in formation in leather trousers whinging about touching someone's face while they're asleep. ""St. Brick Intro"" is not the first time East Atlanta Santa has graced the holidays with an appearance, but let's break down why it's the best: Firstly, Zaytoven has somehow written an ice cold piano line that passes as both a club-ready trap loop and a faithful homage to ""Jingle Bells"". Secondly, the video deserves several Oscars. Opening with Gucci trapping through the snow in a bright red Rolls Royce convertible, CGI snowflakes tumbling onto his denim jacket replete with enormous fur trim, it's an ominous yet beautiful piece of cinematography, like Harmony Korine was tasked with remaking The Grinch, and it has changed the way we view Christmas forever. Do you put Oreos out for Santa? You do now. Have you ever carved up a turkey while singing ""Over the hills we go / Got an extendo and an AK""? Probably not, and maybe you shouldn't, but it's nice to have options. VH1 will now have to reshoot the countdown they air every year to include David Gest saying ""And finally, at number one, Gucci Mane with this nasty-ass beat from 2016"". So, next time someone comes at you with some bullshit about how there have been no good Christmas singles since the mid-90s, kindly inform them they are wrong and crank this up so loud your nan whips out her trigger fingers. Emma Garland There's something about this track that really gives me the feels. Maybe it's because GFOTY whisper-chants ""angel, mistletoe, Christmas day"" over and over again until you can't help chanting along to it, under your breath, at work. Maybe it's because it utilises that pleasing jingle bell sound that immediately makes the festive transmitters in your brain light up. Or maybe it's because it contains the line ""let me ride your christmas sleigh"", which we all know means something hella dirty. Either way, this is an underrated holiday banger that definitely deserves a place on the next That's What I Call Christmas CD. Sort your shit out, NowMusic. Now, you bellends! Daisy Jones Releasing a ""twee"" indie Christmas track that doesn't make you vom sausage rolls all over your ironic reindeer woollens is no mean feat, so big up Best Coast and Wavves. Coming at you like a more acceptable version of She & Him, they recorded this cutesy, low-fi Christmas song to celebrate the holidays in 2010. It's the sort of thing you would send your crush in sixth form to prove your indie credentials and show that you were above the local carol service, but it's still just as sweet now as it was six years back. Granted, it does just layer bells of various descriptions (church; jingle; all the other ones) over what would otherwise be a regular indie track, but who is really complaining when this ode to the trying to find your Christmas presents before the big day is so good natured? Lauren O'Neill Featuring everyone from Cam'ron to Pusha T to Jim Jones, ""Christmas in Harlem"" is arguably the most exquisite Christmas track to have been squeezed into existence. Yes, there are all the stylistic tropes of the festive season - sleigh bells, a synth that sounds as fresh and beautiful as recently fallen snow, an overall aesthetic in the production that feels like every jovial moment in the Home Alone series. But this shit also goes hard. Clocking in at nine minutes long, it takes in everything from festive sex, to late-night christmas shopping, to shopping bricks of yay around the neighbourhood. This is the holiday track you didn't know you wanted, but the one you deserve. Oh - and like all the best presents it's rare and is only available to listen to on this weird-ass website here. Ryan Bassil 2015 was a banner year for Ariana Grande. She released ""Focus"", performed it at the AMAs dressed like R&B game Jessica Rabbit, and verbally slapped the shit out of two radio hosts for being basic as hell and claiming the unicorn emoji was ""for girls"". She also scandalously licked some donuts in a shop, didn't buy them, then proclaimed ""I hate America"". To top it all off, she recorded an entire Christmas EP in her home studio and released it without warning. Titled Christmas & Chill, it sounds like a Cassie album but with sleigh bells and lyrics like ""tis the season for some giving!"", making it the only Santa-referencing release you can pash to without feeling deeply uncomfortable. Every song is fantastic, truly, but this cut stands out because it's essentially a stand-in for everything the Spice Girls have failed to gift us during their various reunions over the last two decades. Emma Garland With a knowingly kitsch throwback aesthetic and tongue-in-cheek lyrics straight out of a kitchen sink romance novel, the Long Blondes were the Pulp the 2000's never knew they needed. Nowhere is this more blindingly obvious than on their wry tearjerker of a Christmas song ""Christmas is Cancelled"". A story of heartbreak. A tale of a particularly British sense of being eternally underwhelmed by everything. A lyric that is the best to have entered any Christmas song before or since, which is: ""No mum, don't worry about me / I'll just have fish and chips for tea / I'll watch the Queen and go to sleep"". Ultimately, ""Christmas is Cancelled"" is the sort of cold, hard #realism that always goes down well with some wine and a Christmas lunch. Load it on up! Lauren O'Neill Unless you're unfortunate enough to have been born into Jamie Oliver's family, Christmas day looks nothing like Love, Actually. Tradition and custom expects you to be rosy-cheeked and gleeful, but if you're feeling like an empty vessel devoid and incapable of any feeling, or your family resembles the cast of Nil By Mouth, Christmas is the salt for all wounds. So, with that in mind, slap on Miley Cyrus' ""My Sad Christmas Song"" because it's a great track about how much this time of year sucks. ""This year feels kind of lame, but the last one was the same,"" she sings, which is waaay better to drunkenly shout along to than that absolutely fucking deranged Wizzard song.

487,487,08-06-17 00:00,2017,6,8,David Lawder,Wilbur Ross sees 'genuine' national security concern on steel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will be completed “very shortly” and will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers.  Ross told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is “a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case,” the second major signal in two days that the Trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions.    In a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Trump said: “Wait until you see what I’m going to do for steel and for your steel companies. We’re going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You’ll be seeing that very soon.”  The steel review under a Cold War-era trade law would result in a “thoughtful” set of recommendations for Trump to consider for action, Ross said. He has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of June.  Ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended: imposing tariffs above the current, country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel products; imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports; and a hybrid “tariff-rate quota” option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels.  Choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs, Ross said. Some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors.  “The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,” Ross said. “So we’re very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers, but also to protect the steel consumers, the steel fabricators, the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel.”  Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Dan Grebler",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel/wilbur-ross-sees-genuine-national-security-concern-on-steel-idUSKBN18Z26U,Politics,Reuters

We’re keeping track of all the ways his presidency veers from the norm in terms of policy and rhetoric.

 The election was in 2016, and 2017 was a long, long year. Welcome to 2018, where President Donald still has questions about Hillary Clinton’s email. Trump called for the Justice Department, which he said was part of the “deep state,” to investigate Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s top aides, for having reportedly sent State Department passwords to her personal Yahoo email account. The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Trump reads regularly, published a report late on New Year’s Day that says that Abedin had violated State Department protocol, allowing her passwords to be claimed in the Yahoo hack of 2013, which compromised some 3 billion of the email service's accounts. The information was auctioned off by a collective in Eastern Europe. And though Trump runs the government, he’s still suggesting that the “deep state” is really in charge. The term “deep state” refers to the entrenched, bureaucratic, conspiratorial forces that are, Trump suggests, wielding considerable power within the government that he leads.  The emails in question, found on Abedin’s soon-to-be ex-husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop. were released by the State Department on Friday. The “sailors pictures on the submarines” Trump’s likely referring to here is another throwback to 2016: It refers to a U.S. Navy sailor who pleaded guilty to snapping a couple of photos of a classified part of a submarine. He was sentenced to six months home confinement.  Trump, in the tweet, suggested that the two incidents were comparable, and appeared to be calling for jail time for Abedin, because her failure to follow security protocol was similar to the Navy sailor’s. The sailor received a sentence of one year in prison as well as six months' home confinement.  CORRECTION Jan. 2, 5:12 p.m.:  A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that a U.S. Navy sailor had not received jail time for photographing classified areas of a submarine. The sailor did in fact receive a year-long prison sentence, as well as 6 months of home confinement.   — Alex Lubben

491,491,15-01-16 11:00,2016,1,15,Libby Nelson,What the US could learn from Singapore about making teachers better,"For teachers in Singapore to advance in their career, they must make sure their students learn. They also have to help their fellow teachers get better. This model of collaborative professional development is one way other countries are doing a better job than the United States at improving the skills of educators. While the US spends billions of dollars a year for occasional workshops on the latest technology or curriculum trends, there's almost no evidence to suggest that the model works. A new study from the National Center on Education and the Economy explores teacher professional development in three countries with excellent education outcomes — Shanghai, Singapore, and British Columbia. The report found that unlike in the United States, in these countries teaching is much more like other careers, where advancement is expected and interaction with other professionals is expected for growth. If the US were able to imitate these systems, experts have argued for years, it could help attract more qualified teachers, raise test scores, and have a lifelong impact on students. There are two ways that teaching doesn't look like other jobs in the United States: The job stays pretty much the same for as long as a teacher is in the classroom, and there's little interaction with other adults. Experts argue that both are a problem when it comes to helping teachers improve. If you started out teaching third grade 35 years ago and retired this year, your last day in the classroom easily could have looked a lot like your first. You might have been getting paid more for more years of experience, but the expertise you'd developed after decades in the classroom wasn't formally recognized. Most professions don't work this way. Lawyers move up from first-year associate to managing partner; nurses can deepen their specialization in branches of medicine. Experts have argued for years that the lack of a similar path in teaching makes it harder to retain good teachers. The clearest path up is becoming a principal — which is essentially an entirely different job. Teachers' skills, perhaps as a result, improve quickly in the first five years they're in the classroom. Then the research disagrees on what happens next. Some studies have found teachers plateau completely; others find they continue to improve, but not as dramatically. ""There’s no reward for getting better at it,"" said Marc Tucker, director of the National Center on Education and the Economy, which released the report today exploring how teachers' professional development works in Shanghai, Singapore, and British Columbia. ""There’s no career in teaching. There’s no high amounts of responsibility to aspire to."" And although teachers are rarely alone, teaching in the US is a solitary profession: They spend most of their time with students, not other adults. Compared with teachers in other countries, teachers in the US spend far more time in front of their classes, which means they have less time to work on lesson planning or collaboration. Teachers in the US teach about 27 hours per week, compared with 19 hours per week in Korea and Shanghai. That means they have less time to discuss problems and techniques with each other and improve their skills. ""Teachers have no time to think, no time to learn, no time to study the kids, no time to study the curriculum,"" Elizabeth Green, the author of Building a Better Teacher, told me last year. ""They have no way of seeing anything that's happening outside their own classroom."" Research has found that collaboration is key to helping teachers improve — or at least that teachers think it is. A 2007 study found a link between teacher collaboration and higher student test scores in Tennessee. A different system of helping teachers learn on the job, already in use in Shanghai, Singapore, and British Columbia, could solve all these problems. Those systems give teachers more time to collaborate, get rid of ineffective professional development, and create a more varied career path for teachers who want to stay in the classroom. Teachers are responsible not just for their students' learning but also for each other's. They work together to develop better lesson plans or new ways of teaching. And they constantly evaluate whether the work they're doing is paying off in the classroom. In Singapore, an elite group of ""master teachers"" are responsible for helping other teachers in the school system to improve. Those teachers train mentors and other leaders within the system, who in turn work with newer teachers to develop their skills. The system expects tangible results. The teachers set goals for what their students will learn, and if students aren't performing well they're expected to adjust. This approach, according to Tucker, turns teachers into researchers who evaluate data and change their approaches accordingly. Teachers use four questions to guide their work: 1) What do we want students to learn? 2) How will we know they have learned it? 3) How will we respond when they don't learn? 4) How do we respond when they already know it? Educating teachers is seen as crucially important: Teachers advance within the profession based in part on how successfully they educate each other, and schools are held accountable for helping their teachers improve. The Singapore system, as well as similar teacher development systems in Shanghai and British Columbia, ""make it very clear that the way we improve schools is to improve teaching,"" said Ben Jensen, the CEO of Learning First and a co-author of the new report. But it also requires a high level of trust in teachers. ""Until you’re willing to let schools try, and some of them will get it wrong, you’re not going to get the growth that’s possible,"" Jensen said, adding that he's not sure the system in the US has that much trust. Unlike many reforms meant to help the US catch up with other countries, this idea wouldn't require a big, national effort. And Tucker suspects that it wouldn't cost more than the billions of dollars that they're already spending on less effective forms of professional development. Creating a system like Singapore's would still face huge hurdles. It would require reimagining how professional development works and, in some cases, reimagining what a teaching career looks like. It would require huge amounts of training to ensure that it's effective. While teachers unions aren't necessarily opposed to a system of master teachers, most teachers' contracts aren't set up for anything like this, and altering them would require tricky political negotiations. Freeing up more time for teachers to collaborate also often means larger classes — common in Singapore and Shanghai but strongly resisted by American teachers One state has come further than the rest in trying to rethink how it helps its teachers improve: Iowa. A new system, backed by the teachers union, creates leadership positions for teachers, including mentoring, serving as a model of good teaching for others, or helping develop the curriculum within their school. At a coaching session at Roosevelt Middle School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in September, Laura Zimmerman, who teaches students learning English, met with instructional coach Anne Ironside to talk about what was going well and poorly in her classroom. They discussed how she could change her language to reflect a ""growth mindset"" — the idea that intelligence isn't fixed but can be developed over time. Ironside asked Zimmerman to pick out specific words and phrases — ""effort,"" ""perseverance,"" ""rise to the challenge"" — to encourage students who are struggling. And she asked her to pick out when in her lesson plan she might use those techniques. ""Sometimes when I give them a writing prompt … that's when they groan,"" Zimmerman said. Ironside asked her which students were most likely to struggle, and asked her to role-play how she would encourage those students to keep it up. They brainstormed other ways she could get students started, including model sentences and extra detail on the assignment, and scheduled Ironside's next visit to Zimmerman's classroom during a writing assignment to check up on whether the advice worked. Feedback in Cedar Rapids used to be much more cursory: a short visit from an administrator, followed by written comments. Under the new system, teachers meet with instructional coaches, some of whom also spend part of their day in the classroom, for 15 to 30 minutes once a week. ""Teachers are saying, I haven’t ever received this much support; I’m getting more support now than I ever have,"" said Mary Ellen Maske, a Cedar Rapids deputy superintendent. Iowa's model has gotten national attention: Education Secretary Arne Duncan visited Ironside and Zimmerman's coaching session on a bus tour in September and said Iowa leads the country in developing new roles for teachers. But it's still far less sophisticated than the systems that Tucker's group highlighted. The key is a policy reform: ""We need an overall strategy that says professional learning is important, we’re going to be explicit about what it looks like, and we’re going to structure policies to get that improvement,"" he said.",https://www.vox.com/2016/1/15/10773592/teachers-singapore-shanghai-professional-development,,Vox

494,494,13-10-17 13:10,2017,10,13,Natalia Antonova,Some victims stayed friends with Harvey Weinstein. I did the same with my rapist. Here’s why.,"First-person essays and interviews with unique perspectives on complicated issues. “That’s it. That’s what they’ll bury her for,” was the first thing I thought. I was reading Ronan Farrow’s excellent New Yorker article on Harvey Weinstein’s alleged history of rape and sexual harassment, when I got to Weinstein’s alleged rape of actress Asia Argento. Argento claims that Weinstein performed oral sex on her, against her will, in a hotel room. Argento goes on to say that she grew close to Weinstein after he assaulted her — accepting gifts, meeting his mother, and having consensual sex with him. A familiar sick feeling washed over me. I could understand how Argento could allow the same man who she says forced himself on her to continue to be part of her life. I also knew — just as she did — exactly how this sequence of events would affect her credibility, in the public’s eye, if she came forward about the assault. “He made it sound like he was my friend and he really appreciated me,” Argento tells Farrow about the relationship she and Weinstein formed after the alleged rape. I shuddered in recognition. Once upon a time, my rapist, another well-connected and accomplished man, did the same to me. Not only did he encourage me to pretend as though nothing bad had happened between us, but he also made it abundantly clear that he would trade on his privilege to encourage me to stay silent. Among the basic tenets of rape culture is the typecasting of the rapist as an aberrant monster and an outlier. Rape culture does not allow for the possibility that a rapist can be a regular guy with a family, your neighbor or colleague, a trusted friend, or the cute guy smiling from across the room at a party. To allow for that possibility is to admit that none of us are truly safe. It would also mean admitting that the victim could not have predicted the rapist’s behavior. One rape culture myth is the idea that “a real rape victim” always acts bravely in the aftermath. She would never appear to be on good terms with her rapist — she would only treat him as the monster he revealed himself to be. A famous example of this is the case of Emma Sulkowicz, or “mattress girl,” who famously accused a fellow Columbia University student of rape. Because Sulkowicz sent friendly texts to the student, Paul Nungesser, after the incident, doubt was cast on her story. Nungesser went on to sue Columbia for sexual discrimination and reached a settlement. “A real rape victim wouldn’t do that,” a male friend told me when we were discussing the controversy. Yet to cast doubt on this scenario ignores both the power differentials between men and women in society and the self-loathing survivors deal with in the aftermath of rape. When I was in my 20s and just starting my writing career, I met a charming fellow writer. He was successful and constantly surrounded by admirers. Meanwhile, I was an unknown. He was known for being a political progressive. Journalists wrote breathless articles about how reading his work had changed their lives. In spite of all that, he seemed shy, startled by his own fame. That disarming shyness was a good disguise. When we saw each other again, in a different city where I barely knew anyone, I readily accepted his invitation to a party at his friend’s house. It was there, after lots of laughter and many more drinks, that he leaned in for a kiss — and my world was turned upside down. He led and I followed willingly into a private room. What started out as consensual turned into something else as he became increasingly violent. Through the haze of alcohol, I remember him gripping me so tightly that I cried out in pain. He clearly liked the sound of me in pain, because things only got worse from there. I could not believe it was happening at first. “You’re hurting me,” I kept saying. “I don’t want this. Please, no.” He apologized — and then he kept going. “You should have known better.” I heard that refrain many times in the years that followed about what happened after that kiss. I heard it especially loud in my own head. I was young, hopeful, and dazzled by him — but I was also a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and violence. How could I not have seen the signs, spotted the fatal flaw? I would later come to realize there was nothing that gave away what would follow. In the light of dawn, he finally let me go. We could both see the road map of bruises and bloody scratches on my body. I was shaking with horror and disgust. He alternated between begging for forgiveness and insisting that nothing bad had occurred. Then he spoke of his admiration for my talent. He said he felt like I had a bright future but that I still needed to jump through hoops to find success. My rapist hugged me by the shoulders and offered me writing advice. I sat next to him, wiping away tears, and listened. We were friends — that was the fiction I created for myself. We’d just had too much to drink. It had been “confusing.” He hadn’t actually meant to hurt me. Forget reporting the rape: Merely admitting it to myself made me want to die. Admitting the truth was dangerous to my writing career. When he came up in conversation in my professional circles, I played out the scene in my head. What if I said, “Actually, this guy is a rapist who got off on my helplessness and pain? Stay away from him.” What would his many fans, fans who included mutual friends of ours, say? I would be cast out. I would be branded a hysterical bitch, a liar, and a jealous fraud who wanted to ruin a great man of letters. Who would want to work with me after that? My rapist, meanwhile, went around introducing me to people, helping me network, pointing me out to his friends whenever we ran into each other. “Natalia is talented; read her plays,” he’d say. Oh, and you also raped me, I would think. The contradictory thoughts would ensue. He feels like he owes me, and that’s why he’s doing this. Or maybe, the bitter voice of my own self-hatred whispered, I owed him. Sexual violence doesn’t just affect the body. It warps and pollutes the mind. He had already done the bad thing. He had assaulted me. Now the least he could do was make up for it somehow. I’ve heard plenty of women assaulted by their colleagues say the same thing over the years. But the truth is, favors from a rapist become just another sick game the victim is drawn into. It doesn’t make anything better — not on the inside, anyway. It makes things worse. “When I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak,” Argento said of Weinstein. I know that feeling well. Sexual assault engenders it, and being forced to play nice with your rapist perpetuates it. The guilt of knowing that your silence may have enabled your rapist to harm others sits like a slab of granite on your chest. In the United States, only about a third of rapes and sexual assaults are reported. It’s not just that rape is a difficult crime to prosecute — it’s that our very attitudes about rape are simplistic. To this day, we still talk more about what women should do to prevent rape as opposed to worrying over how to raise boys not to feel entitled to women’s bodies. Harvey Weinstein, while admitting some wrongdoing and denying that he raped anyone, has also defended himself by suggesting that he is merely a product of a different time. Yet we recently elected a man who boasts about assaulting women to the highest office in the land. How much has really changed, after all? As for me, years later, I began trying to rebuild my self-worth against all odds. You are not the thing he did to you, I tell myself these days. You don’t owe him anything. They still occasionally sound hollow, these words. One day, I hope they will stick. Natalia Antonova is a writer and journalist.

495,495,29-08-16 00:00,2016,8,29,,Congressional leaders ask for more time to study new fuel rules,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Three Congressional leaders on Monday asked top federal environmental and safety officials to extend by 60 days the public comment period on new vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards.  The public and their advocates need more time, beyond the comment period that ends Sept. 26, to absorb more than 1,000 pages of a draft technical assessment report, the three said in a letter to the environmental and safety chiefs.  A week ago, U.S. regulators denied a similar request for an extension by major automakers.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a July report that automakers have the technology to meet aggressive mandates to hike fuel efficiency, but improvements will not be as great as the Obama administration once forecast because buyers are switching to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles from lighter cars.          When the administration first outlined its goal of boosting average fleet fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon, regulators forecast that 67 percent of vehicles sold in 2025 would be cars.      Since then, gasoline prices have fallen and truck and SUV sales have surged.       Regulators now estimate the fleet will average 50 to 52.6mpg in 2025.  The letter dated Monday was sent to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind. It was signed by three members of the U.S. House of Representatives: Fred Upton, chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; Ed Whitfield, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power; and Michael Burgess, chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade.

497,497,22-07-16 16:19,2016,7,22,Tom Taylor,Jose Aldo Expects McGregor Rematch in NYC,"In the main event of UFC 194, Jose Aldo's incredible reign as WEC and UFC featherweight champion came to a skittering halt when he walked into a Conor McGregor left hand just 13 seconds after the fight began. Almost seven months later, on the main card of the historic UFC 200, Aldo rebounded from this career-altering loss in the strongest way possible, out-striking long-time contender Frankie Edgar to a unanimous decision win, and winning the interim featherweight title in the process. The reason for the creation of this interim title, of course, comes down entirely to McGregor. Shortly after his title-winning blitzkrieg of Aldo, the Irishman set his sights on the lightweight strap, and after an unfortunate injury to then lightweight champion Rafael Dos Anjos, ended up in the welterweight division, where he would lose to Nate Diaz in one of the year's biggest upsets. Today, McGregor is preparing for a UFC 202 rematch with Diaz, and not surprisingly, that rematch is incredibly important to his career. If he loses, it'll be two losses in a row to the same man, and this will deflate whatever is left of his mystique. If he wins, meanwhile, he'll restore some of that mystique, and continue on down the road as MMA's biggest and most marketable star. The ramifications of this rematch extend far beyond McGregor, however. The outcome of his UFC 202 bout with Diaz will also have a huge impact on the featherweight division and the many elite fighters that currently fill its uppermost ranks. McGregor still is, after all, the division's undisputed king. Aldo, who now wears interim gold in McGregor's stead, is acutely aware of the strange influence this welterweight bout will have on his division. During a recent media scrum in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian explained that the more worrying outcome for him is a McGregor victory. ""He has to lose [to Diaz.],"" Aldo told the media. ""Otherwise, they will do a third fight. If he wins, they will do another rematch with Nate, and that's bad."" The reason this would be so ""bad"" for Aldo, of course, is that he's unlikely to earn the McGregor rematch he so desperately craves as long as the Irishman is fighting outside the featherweight division. If McGregor loses to Diaz again, however, Aldo's future looks much brighter. In fact, the Brazilian believes a second loss to Diaz will send McGregor back down to featherweight, which would lay the groundwork for their title-unifying rematch. And should such a rematch occur, Aldo believes there would be no better choice of location than the UFC's debut in New York City this November. ""If he loses (to Diaz), it's highly likely that they put us to fight on November 12 at Madison Square Garden,"" Aldo explained. ""The Irish community is big over there."" If McGregor wins and continues to compete in heavier divisions, Aldo told the media that he expects a bout with streaking contender Max Holloway is next. And though this isn't the fight the interim champ is hoping for, he said it's a fight he'll take, especially if it's in New York City. ""If it's a fight against Holloway, I don't see any problem. This event in New York will make history. I really hope I'm at this card because I want to be part of history,"" Aldo explained. ""But I really hope [the McGregor rematch] happens."" Yes, it's safe to say that Jose Aldo will be watching the UFC 202 main event very closely, as its outcome will have a huge impact on the course of his immediate career.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7m3jw/jose-aldo-expects-mcgregor-rematch-in-nyc,Sports,Vice

The debate about whether a young U.S. player should develop his talents in a domestic or foreign league spiked after rumors emerged of Morris signing with Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. But on Thursday, Morris officially signed with his hometown Seattle Sounders. Cue USMNT fan base overreaction. Morris represents a bit of an anomaly: he's a talented non-professional American who has garnered the attention of a reputable European club, despite falling outside of the typical age range for European youth recruitment. Morris went to the Seattle Sounders FC Youth Academy for a year before signing a letter of intent to play for Stanford University. He was later brought up to play for the USMNT by Jurgen Klinsmann, a coach known for encouraging his players to play abroad. But despite earning the seal of approval from the USMNT German manager, it seems that whatever happened rubbed Werder Bremen coach Thomas Eichin the wrong way. ""We're in a situation now where we need players who fully identify with Werder and the way things are done here, in order for them to focus properly on the task ahead,"" Eichen said. Eichin later went on to tell Bild that Morris was ""homesick."" The Werder Bremen manager's comments are not a good look for American soccer players, who bear a reputation of being soft (*cough* Landon Donovan *cough*). But despite getting turned down by the more highly-regarded Bundesliga, pundits are saying that the move to the Sounders is solid. Not to mention the fact that reports are stating that it is the richest homegrown player contract in MLS history. Hard to tell what life Morris would have led to in Germany, but maybe a little under-hyped move could be beneficial to the young player.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnmbqq/jordan-morris-signs-with-the-seattle-sounders-the-us-soccer-world-implodes,Sports,Vice
500,500,11-06-19 00:00,2019,6,11,Colin Packham,Australia PM to meet national broadcaster after police raids,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he will meet with executives from the national broadcaster on Tuesday as he sought to calm tensions following two police raids against prominent media organizations.      Police last week raided the head office of the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) and the home of a News Corp editor amid investigations into two alleged national security leaks.  The raids, which police said were unrelated, triggered complaints of assaults on press freedom.      Under mounting pressure, Morrison said he will consider any proposals to improve media protection when he meets ABC chairperson Ita Buttrose and managing director David Anderson.      “If there is a suggestion or evidence or any analysis that reveals there is need for further improvement of those laws, then the government is always open to that,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.  Australia has no underlying safeguards for free speech in its constitution. When the government ratcheted up counter-espionage laws in 2018, it added a provision to protect whistleblowers.  Morrison, who was overseas during the police raids, can ill afford to have the issue drag on, analysts say.      He wants parliament to approve promised tax cuts when legislators return after last month’s election, but some lawmakers want to prioritize amendments to protect press freedoms.      The government does not hold a majority in the upper house Senate and Morrison will probably need the support of several independents to pass his signature tax cuts.  “We should move that protection across to any investigation of journalists in the conduct of their role,” said independent senator Rex Patrick, referring to the provision for whistleblowers.

501,501,08-04-19 20:50,2019,4,8,Jane Coaston,"College admissions fraud: 14 people, including actress Felicity Huffman, plead guilty in college admissions scam","Of the scores of people who allegedly took part in a wide-ranging college admissions scam to get the children of wealthy parents into top-ranked colleges, 14 of them will plead guilty to bribery and mail fraud charges, the Department of Justice announced Monday. According to the Department of Justice, 13 parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and one former college tennis coach have accepted plea deals, though their sentences are yet to be determined. In a statement, Huffman said, “I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions.” In a statement, Felicity Huffman says she’s pleading guilty.“I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.” pic.twitter.com/T6tx1VUiCE As I wrote in March, more than 50 people, including Huffman and actress Lori Loughlin, were initially charged with fraud as part of “Operation Varsity Blues,” a massive investigation into a college admissions fraud in which parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to William “Rick” Singer, a Southern California business executive, to facilitate cheating on standardized testing exams like the ACT and to have their children falsely designated as athletes. In some cases, that even entailed paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to make coaches claim the children were being recruited to play sports for their schools. The scheme worked in two ways. Some parents paid Singer through his foundation to either have someone take their child’s SAT and ACT tests or “correct” their answers: First, the Department of Justice alleges that in return for payments from parents ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 per test, Singer paid other people — including a man named Mark Riddell, who was also indicted — to either take standardized tests required for college admissions at many schools for their children or correct their answers after the fact. He also, according to the DOJ, used those payments to bribe teachers and ACT and SAT test administrators so they would overlook the cheating, often sending those payments via the Key Worldwide Foundation. When a parent asked whether bribing test administrators worked, Singer laughed and replied, “every time,” adding the kids “just have no idea that they didn’t even get the score that they thought they got.” Other parents paid Singer to bribe college sports coaches to “recruit” their child and get them into universities, even creating fake “recruiting profiles.” The second part of the scheme is where things get even more interesting. According to the charging documents, wealthy parents collectively paid Singer more than $25 million to get their children into top universities by bribing college coaches and administrators into designating their children as recruited athletes — when they very much were not. According to the DOJ, the parents who took a tax deduction from their “contributions” to Singer’s foundation (in reality, money used to bribe college coaches or pay people to take standardized tests for students) will also pay back the IRS. In addition, the Department of Justice notes: “The charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.”",https://www.vox.com/2019/4/8/18300903/college-scam-huffman-admissions-sports,,Vox
502,502,30-09-16 11:00,2016,9,30,Joseph Cox,This Cybersecurity Firm Maps Hackers' Lives by the Clues They Leave Online,"The digital underground, populated by hackers, drug dealers, and other criminals, is a vast space. The sheer number of forums, cybercriminal handles, and backroom dealings can be overwhelming to researchers or journalists. Some cybersecurity companies have devised ways to gain a bird's-eye view on that space.  Next month at the Black Hat Europe hacking conference, Christopher Ahlberg, CEO and co-founder of threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, will show how, by scraping vast quantities of posts from forums, it's possible to reveal trends among different groups of users—such as hackers—and potentially generate leads to identify some of them too.  ""We wanted to see: Could we actually track individuals, and groups of individuals, without knowing their individual handles?"" Ahlberg told Motherboard in a phone interview. For the past four years, Recorded Future has crawled forums and sites across the dark, deep, and surface web. Using this information, the company provides customers with information about any perceived threats to their business or organisation, such as planned attacks or data on sale. According to Recorded Future's website, 86 percent of Fortune 100 companies get their intelligence from Recorded Future. Today, the company is monitoring close to 1,000 sites, Ahlberg said. With that wealth of data comes the opportunity to track users or groups from one place to another or map out when they're active. For example, Ahlberg said that users of an Iranian hacking forum basically went quiet on the anniversary of the Iranian revolution, while a Saudi forum peaked on Ramadan.  Those sort of findings may seem pretty innocuous, but there are more revealing insights. On one Iranian forum, there was a spike in activity on Wednesdays. Why? Microsoft traditionally releases new security patches on Tuesdays: The hackers were discussing how to reverse-engineer the newly published information to figure out how to exploit vulnerabilities. A similar phenomenon exists for Russian forums too. ""We can actually see proof of it in the data,"" Ahlberg said. But whereas the tool shows Russian users tend to post at night, a number of Iranians are active during the day. That gives an indication, according to Ahlberg, ""that the Iranians are either university students or government employees doing this stuff."" It's then possible to zoom in further and analyse when some users stop posting and others start. Ahlberg pointed to two prolific Iranian hackers, ""Hassan20"" and ""Crisis"". When one would stop posting, the other would suddenly spring into action.  ""Now I probably have a very good indication that Hassan20 and Crisis is the same guy,"" Ahlberg said. This is not to say that big data just magically unmasked these hackers. Instead, information like this might act as a decent starting point for further investigation. ""Of course, this is just leads,"" Ahlberg said.

507,507,18-12-16 19:12,2016,12,18,Joel Balsam,How Will We Rebel in the Future?,"This article originally appeared on VICE Canada What did you do to piss off your parents when you were a kid? Did you sneak off to the park and smoke a J? Maybe you had sex somewhere or with someone you weren't supposed to?  Now that I've got you thinking about the good ol' days, pull out your crystal ball and think about how your bratty kids and even grandkids will tell you to shove it.  They're going to do something that we think is painfully idiotic, that's no doubt. But what?  Will they still smoke weed when their parents are having lame cannabis and cheese tastings? Will they bother to bone when they're oversaturated with porn from the moment they start feeling tingly in weird places?  To find some answers I called up Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurologist who predicted that human-on-robot sex will be more common than human-on-human sex by 2050.  Pearson predicts that many drugs we know (and love) today will likely become legal after they're chemically engineered to be safer. But, advances in medicine and biotech will have us getting high in trippy new ways.  For instance, scientists have already developed transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a form of therapy for psychiatric disorders. In the future, you might be able to pop on a pair of nifty rTMS headphones and feel the effects of getting high by disabling different parts of the brain. You might even have the ability to turn your high on and off whenever you want.  Scientists are also working on ways to steer pills packed with medication into certain areas of the body as a way to fight off cancer. Once the drug reaches the desired location in the body, like the liver for instance, the plan is to rupture the capsule from outside the body using electromagnetic waves or ultrasound. ""But what if,"" Pearson asks, ""you were to encapsulate heroin or morphine in smart drug capsules?""  Picture this scenario: You go to the club after dropping a pill of Molly—but nothing happens after you take it. You're bobbing around sober for a while, until suddenly the DJ flicks a switch. Invisible electromagnetic waves are sent out into the club, rupturing all the ecstasy pills, and boom—everyone is higher than a spaceship telling their friends how much they love them. Maybe you're even wearing a pair of rTMS headphones at the same time, giving you the ability to turn off your high if you're not into it.  Cool right? But if the drugs are all safe and legal, taking them would be about as rebellious as gobbling up munchies on the couch with your blazed parents—kinda meh.  ""The trouble with becoming a rebel is that if something's legal it's not very rebellious to take it,"" said Pearson.  So what could our grandkids do that's unsafe, stupid, and illegal all at the same time?  ""Supposing you were able to use one of these fancy drugs and put some clever IT in there so that you could give control of your brain to somebody else, now that would be rebellious,"" Pearson said.  He predicts that by 2040, humans will be able to electronically share bodies with somebody else, link consciousness through the internet, and even control someone else's brain against their will. Yep, we'd have the power to turn our friends, sex slaves, and enemies into freaking zombies.  For this to go mainstream, Pearson says all it would take is the Selena Gomez of 2040 to post on social media about how dope it is to be a zombie and millions of teens will be going to school not just dressed as their BFF, but living as their BFF.  Pearson took me further down the rabbit hole by throwing another future technology into the mix. He says the next level of Fitbits will be receptors pasted right on our skin. At first, we'll be able to simply record our pulse and basic stuff like that. But when we're able to insert the device deeper than the first layers of skin and get in contact with our nerves, we'll have the potential to record, replay, and even control an orgasm as easily as pressing Ctrl+Alt+O.  Pearson provided this scenario: ""So if you were wanting to go to bed with your best friend's girlfriend and you give the best friend this fancy wristwatch and you don't tell him that it's got his nervous system on it. You could use that to hack into his nervous system and steal his sensations and effectively be in bed with his girlfriend."" Which is basically a David Cronenberg film come to life.  Besides mind and nerve control to spice it up in the bedroom, Pearson predicts ""an explosion of sexual capability"" where future generations will move past the binary of male and female and invent third, fourth, and fifth genders. And he's not talking about transgender. With the ability to electronically control sensations in addition to advances in virtual and augmented reality, people could dream up completely new genders and genitalia.  ""There's nothing to stop you from having another organ coming out of your belly button or your right arm,"" he said. ""You could have some appendage that attaches to your forehead and acts as a sex organ.""  Again, social media, might determine what becomes a popular way to rebel, and what's just plain weird.  ""You can't predict which [genders or sexual orientations] will be successful because ultimately it'll come down to which pop star is most popular on the future Twitter and they'll create fads.""  But the problem with going down a path where we continuously seek out new ways to fuck and get fucked up is that it could just as easily go too far—think raping and murdering robots like in Westworld or watching torture on live TV.  So what if we go down a different path?  Pearson says the mob mentality we see today on social media where everyone gets offended could lead us down a road where we'd become outcasts for what we do and say today.  ""You can bet your life that whatever things you believe today, that same basket would get you into trouble in 2050,"" said Pearson. ""Kissing your girlfriend might be a criminal offense.""  In that dystopia, advancements in surveillance technology could make it possible to be thrown in jail for committing thought crimes à la Nineteen Eighty-Four or automatically fined for swearing like in Demolition Man.  In either scenario, Pearson says the world is probably going to shit (WTF grandkids?). The reason the futurologist has such a negative viewpoint of the future is because even if we develop all the technology we can muster to make sex and drugs better, at the end of the day, we're still the same species that has tortured, enslaved, and imprisoned each other for centuries, and that's the problem right there.  ""We have plenty of evidence humans aren't really nice underneath,"" he said. ""We haven't really progressed since we were cavemen in any real respect and given the right technology or the right legal environment people would do exactly the same again.""

508,508,11-01-16 12:00,2016,1,11,Mike Piellucci,Jake Coker Is Another Quarterback Cog in the Crimson Tide Machine,"Functionally speaking, Jake Coker is to Alabama what Blake Sims, A.J. McCarron, Greg McElroy, and John Parker Wilson were before him: a cog in the greater Process. Each of those quarterbacks had distinctive flourishes, of course. Coker made it to Alabama—and before that, to Florida State—on raw arm strength, which separates him from Sims's hare-like scrambles, McCarron's unerring poise, McElroy's moxie and resourcefulness, or Wilson's immaculate high school pedigree. Still, those differences don't seem to matter much, not when the most glamorous and important position nearly everywhere else in football—quarterback—is anything but in Tuscaloosa. When Alabama and Clemson meet in tonight's College Football Playoff championship game in Glendale, Arizona, all eyes will be on the matchup between dynamic Tigers quarterback DeShaun Watson and the Crimson Tide's smothering defense. Meanwhile, is anyone even talking about Coker? Watson is college football's best player at his position, and the Tigers head into the game as the sport's top-ranked team; the former unquestionably informs the latter. Watson will be expected to win the Heisman Trophy as a junior next year. After that, he'll probably be a first-round NFL Draft selection. Barring catastrophic injury, football fans will hear and recognize his name for years to come, no matter what happens in the title game—a game Clemson wouldn't even be playing without Watson's game-breaking run-pass abilities. Contrast this to Alabama. The Crimson Tide are the college game's current standard-bearer, even though head coach Nick Saban has never enjoyed the campus equivalent of Tom Brady behind center. That seems to be by design: the ideal Saban game plan requires his quarterbacks to conform to the rhythms of a conservative, smash-mouth football game, not disrupt them. Indeed, Alabama's eternal signal-caller mandate goes something like this: maintain possession, primarily through depositing the ball safely into the gut of whichever 220-plus-pound tailback-cum-mauler happens to be on campus that year; supplement those handoffs by throwing ropes to the super-talented, defense-breaking likes of Julio Jones, Amari Cooper, or Calvin Ridley; and above all, don't fuck things up for a perpetually punishing defense full of five-star high school recruits and future NFL Draft picks. None of this precludes star-making turns, per se: McCarron's path to becoming a Crimson Tide icon and eventual Heisman runner-up began with an iconic performance in the 2012 National Championship game against LSU. Still, there's a reason why McCarron never even cracked first team All-SEC. Quarterbacks can be stars within the parameters set by Saban, but they'll never transcend them. The Saban war machine will continue grinding bodies up long after Coker is gone. For all Alabama's success in his only season as a starter, Coker is highly likely to never play another moment of meaningful football after tonight. You won't see him anywhere near the top of the NFL draft boards; the only debate about his draft stock heading into his appearance in this month's Senior Bowl centers around whether he deserves to be invited at all. Modern college football tells us that Jake Coker should be significant. All of us have internalized the rules of the Way We Play Now: quality quarterbacking wins games, especially when it comes by way of dynamic, spread-based sets. Prolific pro-style quarterbacks are a threatened species, hefty defensive fronts can't handle frenetic no-huddle looks, and, well, it's just easier to assimilate than to fight the long arc of history. Yet Coker is notable precisely because he is not: while Alabama hardly wins in spite of him, he is nowhere close to the catalyst for what could be the Crimson Tide's fourth title in seven seasons, an inarguably dynastic run. Fairly or not, the Tigers, with their generational quarterback and their up-tempo offense, are touchdown underdogs in tonight's game, seen as inferior to Alabama's old-school pro sets and replacement-level quarterback. The Tide's overall breadth of talent plays a role here, certainly, but mostly the line reflects confidence in Alabama's ability to smother opposing innovation with relentless, overpowering convention. Look, Alabama isn't stuck in the 1980s. Saban isn't stupid, and anyone who has peered above assistant coach Lane Kiffin's Denny's menu play card can make note of his quietly good work as offensive coordinator. Still, Alabama has a winning formula. Sims was a stylistic outlier, and Alabama tailored its offense to fit his gifts, but Saban is far more likely to tweak his old-school system than to overhaul it. Why change what's working, especially when all of your opponents' speeding up has done so little to slow you down? As such, it's hard to envision Alabama needing its quarterback to matter, let alone matter at the level of a Watson. The right player very well could through sheer force of talent; redshirt freshman David Cornwell, in particular, has more tools than any of his predecessors. But season in and season out, players like Coker will do just fine. That's something of the Alabama way, a perfect fit for a program that claimed 13 national titles before it snared its first Heisman Trophy, and which until yesterday had not produced a quarterback that started a NFL playoff game since 1982. Coker still bears watching tonight, because there is always a chance that he builds on a strong semifinal performance and transcends Alabama's limits one more time. Even if he doesn't—even if Alabama's entire offensive game plan is to let Henry rumble downhill 45 times—he's still the starting quarterback for a school in the middle of one of college football's best-ever runs. Sometimes it's better to be part of the machine than to fight it.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgzjpq/alabama-jake-coker-is-another-quarterback-cog-in-the-crimson-tide-machine,Sports,Vice
509,509,26-07-16 00:00,2016,7,26,Nathan RP Young,The Flower-Filled Photos of Hmong Women on Dating Sites,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. — At the age of four, in 1986, Pao Houa Her sought refuge from Laos with her family in the US. By 2011, she became the first Hmong woman to graduate from Yale’s MFA program, focusing her photography on Hmong refugee populations in the US. Currently up at Bockley Gallery in Minneapolis is My Mother’s Flowers, Her’s new body of work where she pairs lo-fi studio shots of her mother’s collection of silk flowers with profile pictures that Hmong women use on dating sites. Most of these women post pictures of themselves posing with flowers, often standing next to real trees or before studio backdrops. According to Her, though such social networks publicly market themselves for dating, these women, living in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, in fact seek Hmong-American suitors to send money to their families and deliver them to the US. Her’s mother has amassed countless bouquets of silk flowers, collecting dust in corners of Her’s childhood home or cast away into the basement. The juxtaposition of flowers in My Mother’s Flowers bridges the lives of Hmong women around the world as a symbol of the search for a better life.  On the night of the opening last month I was chatting with Her as photographer Wing Young Huie arrived. Back in 2012 Huie curated one of Her’s first exhibitions, Somebody, at Gordon Parks Gallery at Metro State University. Since 1995 Huie has produced massive public art projects, his most recent being University Avenue Project (2010), spanning six miles of University Avenue in Twin Cities. These days he’s narrowed his focus with a book project, Chinese-ness, a series of stories and portraits of Chinese-American immigrants, adoptees, and his fellow American-born Chinese — sometimes referred to as ABC’s. Together Her’s and Wing’s projects capture a working image of the Asian-American experience.  We sat down again a few weeks later and discussed the cultural gulf between first and second generation immigrant and refugee families, the ways photographs represent our selective memories, and Her’s own significance as a distinguished female voice in the Hmong-American community.  *    *    * Nathan Robert Payne Young: Pao, some of your earlier projects touch on studio photography, an activity popular among some Hmong-American communities.  With businesses like Xiong Portraits in St. Paul’s Hmong Village, what is it about posing for pictures with costumes and backdrops that you, your friends, and your family find so compelling? Pao Houa Her: My earliest memories of Thailand, being in the refugee camps, are actually these memories of getting our portraits taken at one of these places. And thinking about it now, and looking at countless studio portraits, for a lot of us it’s a way out of reality, right? Once you’re in front of this backdrop that’s usually very floral, or usually an iconic image, and you put on clothes that you don’t wear every day, shiny clothes, maybe things you wear once a year, maybe for the Hmong New Year, or even clothes that you don’t actually have yourself — like at Xiong Portraits they have clothes from all over the world, Chinese outfits, Vietnamese outfits, wedding gowns. I think what it does is transport you out of your own reality. You’re this reimagined person, and I want to say, for a lot of us, that’s the allure of studio portraits. NRPY: Pictures on the walls of Xiong Portraits show iconic images of poppies and Hmong regalia. What were the backdrops and costumes for studios in Thailand?  PHH: They were these painted backdrops, sometimes of mountainscapes or of Hmong villages, and always prop plants at the sides. I think a lot of Hmong folks from my parents’ era and my own era who were born or spent time in Laos have these pictures. These are pictures that we carry, that I still have of my parents, of us.  NRPY: Two of the three types of pictures in this exhibition are either found studio portraits of Hmong women posing for online dating sites, or studio shoots that you’ve personally produced. Could you tell us about these dating sites, and why you grouped the two types of portraiture? PHH: With these dating sites, Hmong men go overseas to look for a “pure Hmong woman,” one who has not been altered, a Hmong woman that is very Hmong, that, you know, hasn’t been influenced by Western ideology.  Wing Young Huie: These are Hmong men in the US  looking for — PHH: — for Hmong girls not in the US.   NRPY:  And what’s their idea of the “pure Hmong woman”?  PHH: Well, there’s a general conversation that happens in our community among Hmong men when asked why they need to go to Laos to find these girls. And the conversation always comes down to them saying, “girls here are too Westernized, and because they’re Westernized they use Western rules and social norms and so they can’t be Hmong.” They have their own ideas of how a Hmong woman should behave in front of their husband. NRPY: Wing, this reminds me of a few pictures from your project, Frogtown, of a Hmong family in a suburban house conducting a ceremony for a sick child. A shaman’s there with a live pig on the ground, eventually they gut the pig — WYH: — and drink the blood.  NRPY: Right, and you have this picture of the men doing their work and then another with all the women in a different room eating together. PHH: Yes, there’s a huge separation and that’s there in our culture. The men kill the pig, the women do the prep, we set the table for the men, and we eat the men’s leftovers. It’s a practice, it’s our tradition. And actually, can I just say, Wing, your work was essentially the reason why I became a photographer. Because, Wing, you’ve had these public exhibitions on Lake Street and University Avenue and in Frogtown and the community has been able to see your work, which is something remarkable in itself. Not only have you inspired me to become a photographer, I truly believe that you’ve influenced a whole generation of Hmong artists. When I saw Frogtown it was the first time that I saw myself. I’d never ever seen images of my people like those before. WYH: Wow. PHH: It was the first time I saw myself, and I thought, “this is what I want to do.” NRPY: Before seeing Frogtown, were you actively aware of the images around you, that you were not being reflected back? Thinking, these people aren’t me, I am not them.  PHH: Oh, yeah! Absolutely. So I knew of Diane Arbus before Wing, and I knew August Sanders, and thinking, oh these are great, but I specifically remember a photo that Wing took of my uncle who — WYH: — I photographed your uncle?  PHH: You photographed a lot of my family members! You have this portrait of my uncle, who killed himself in the very same place that you photographed. He’s there with all my other uncles. So with Frogtown I’m seeing for the first time these pictures of my people, literally my family. WYH: Wow. But, Pao, your relationship to photography, I mean it’s no different from anybody’s. You think about weddings and wedding photographers: what do those pictures have to do with the wedding? They’re idealized versions, so you look at the photo, you show it, you keep it for generations and everyone remembers your life through that idealized, glamorized memory. PHH: You know, I don’t think of photography as just memory. For me photography is never real. It’s fiction. Think of this show now, and the decision to choose a photograph. The photograph in front of us is like the selected memory in our minds. So maybe it’s not that photography is fiction, but photography is selected memory.  WYH: I feel like what I’m seeing in your work here is a collision of different intentions and all the artifice at the same time. So, one of these men on these sites, where they grew up they had all the power, and they come here, they don’t speak English, they don’t have power, their kids do the translating for them. They want to go back home, to that time. They want that again, through a pure, young girl. These dating sites … they’re not really dating sites. PHH: No. WYH: They’re a business transaction. PHH: Yup. WYH: My first thought is, this woman is selling herself. And for what?  NRPY: Because the agreement is that this Hmong man will deliver her from Laos or wherever back to the US, right? PHH: Oh, yes.   WYH: And the family’s helping, they’re helping sell her wife duties. It’s heartbreaking. All of these realities are converging. It’s all imagined, romanticized, and then real.  NRPY: So this exhibition’s titled My Mother’s Flowers. As you set up the low-key photo studio in your mother’s home, how did she respond, and what has been her reaction to the printed images? PHH: My mom has never been to an opening. I think in some ways she doesn’t really get the concept of being an artist. So when I do set up these studios in our house, and as I’ve photographed her before, she’s supportive and she helps, she allows it to happen, but …  WYH: Same with my mom. Art has no meaning for our mothers. They just want you to do well. The cultural gulf between the first and second generation — you never really understanding why she did this, and her not getting what you’re up to, it’s really the same, it’s you two trying to connect, it’s unknowable. I see these flowers, they’re our mothers — frozen in time, collecting dust. Now my parents never set foot in a museum. Why would they? They’re immigrants. Art’s a luxury. For you, Pao, to go to Yale, just to understand what that culture’s like, it’s unfathomable for them. PHH: Hmong folks have only been in the US for about 40 years and so it’s still very much about survival. Parents think, hey let’s get our kids to be doctors and lawyers and successful in elite, traditional, reliable ways.  WYH: There have been three or four waves of generations of Chinese immigrants to the US. But how many Chinese artists can you name? How many directors? How long does this take? It’s a luxury. You know, Pao, in a sense, what you’re doing now has taken me 30 years to figure out. I had to photograph thousands of people before I could really think about and make art about my family. It’s your idea of Laos, and the reality; the young girl’s idea of marriage, and the reality; ideas of America, and the reality; the older men and their ideas of the past. Your photographs are a culmination of layers and layers of cultural illusions. NRPY: Wing, your family also migrated to America, from Guangzhou, China. But you were born in Duluth. Could you tell about your current project, Chine-ness, and about your relationship with your families’ migration?  WYH: When I went to China for the first time, six years ago, I was working for the US Embassy and Arts Midwest on a new program showing the US through a Chinese-American’s eyes, and traveled to 10 cities in China. Coming from Minnesota, inside I felt like everyone else, but outside I stuck out. And in China, where I look like everyone, but inside I really feel like a foreigner, it all made me think, what if? How would my life have turned out if my family never left China? So what if I owned a restaurant like my dad, or became an engineer like my brother, or, if I turned like my mom really wanted, which was to marry a nice Chinese woman and have nice Chinese kids — that didn’t happen. So I decided to photograph men whose lives I could have had, and then I gave them the camera and asked to wear their clothes and have them photograph me. Then I put the photographs together as a diptych as a way to try and understand, what if?  NRPY: Do you think, Pao, if you never left Laos, that you might have been one of these women in your own exhibition?  PHH: Yes, all the time. I think about the Hmong narrative in the US and it lacks a female perspective. If you think about Hmong oral history, it’s always Hmong men telling our history, and they block our voices. Even our story cloths from the 1970s from the refugee camps. The Hmong men decided the story and the women did the sewing. With my photography it’s important that the female voice and perspective becomes center stage.

510,510,09-11-16 00:00,2016,11,9,Javier Galeano,"Anti-Trump protesters gather for third night, one shot in Portland","MIAMI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took their frustrations over Donald Trump’s election as the next U.S. president onto the streets on Friday and into Saturday in several cities, including Portland, Oregon, where one protester was shot.  The unidentified man was wounded on Portland’s Morrison Bridge at 12:45 a.m. local time as he and dozens of other protesters crossed it during their demonstration, one of several across the country denouncing Trump’s campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and women.  In the Portland incident, police said in a statement that a man got out of a vehicle on the bridge where he confronted and then shot a protester, who was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The suspect is still at large, police added.  Earlier in the night, protesters blocked traffic and threw objects at Portland police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices. At one point, police pushed protesters back and appeared to take at least one person into custody, according to footage on a local NBC affiliate.   Hundreds of protesters also marched through the streets of Los Angeles, blocking traffic as they waved signs in opposition of Trump and chanted “We reject the president elect” and “Whose streets? Our Streets”.   Several thousand activists marched through downtown Miami, with a few hundred making their way onto a highway, halting traffic in both directions.  In New York, demonstrators again gathered in Washington Square Park and by Trump Tower, where the Republican president-elect lives, on Fifth Avenue.  Trump, who initially denounced Americans who protested against his election, saying they had been “incited” by the media, reversed course and praised them on Friday.  “Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!” Trump said on Twitter.  The tweets were further evidence of Trump’s mixed messages since he announced his candidacy 17 months ago. After Democrat Hillary Clinton conceded defeat early on Wednesday, he took a far more conciliatory tone than he had often displayed during his campaign and promised to be a president for all Americans.   Anti-Trump demonstrators have voiced concerns that his presidency, due to start on Jan. 20, would infringe on Americans’ civil and human rights.   They cited his campaign promises to restrict immigration and register Muslims, as well as allegations the former reality-TV star sexually abused women.  Protesters in various cities have chanted slogans, including “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!” and carried signs reading “Impeach Trump”.  White supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) have praised Trump’s election, and some civil rights advocacy groups have reported a spike of attacks on minorities following Trump’s victory on Tuesday.  Trump has rejected the KKK’s support.  Most of the protests across the country, which have also taken place in Washington, D.C., have been largely comprised of young adults and college students.  With the country evenly divided, many voters were shocked by the result given that opinion polls failed to predict Trump’s triumph. The Republican Party also managed to maintain its majorities in both houses of Congress in Tuesday’s vote.  More anti-Trump demonstrations were planned for the weekend, including in New York and Los Angeles. A group calling itself “#NotMyPresident” has scheduled an anti-Trump rally for Washington on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, when the New York real-estate developer formally succeeds President Barack Obama.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged on Friday the tight race with Clinton, but said anti-Trump protesters have to accept the election results. He pointed to Trump’s call for unity and meetings on Thursday with Obama and Republican leaders as reasons for reassurance.  Security barricades now shield some of Trump’s most visible properties, including the newly opened Trump International Hotel near the White House and Trump Tower in New York.  Trump’s base of support in the election was the broad middle of the country, with voters in states that had long supported Democrats shifting to him after he promised to renegotiate trade deals with other countries.

511,511,20-03-18 19:56,2018,3,20,Patrick Klepek,This Company Specializes In Designing One Specific Thing: Video Game Guns,"This article is part of a special series on the intersection of guns and games. For more, click here. Most video games have weapons, and lots of those weapons happen to be guns. Some are based on real-life firearms, others are pure fantasy, and often it’s somewhere in the middle. It’s also common for developers to seek outside help for very specific tasks—art, writing, etc. Rmory, founded in 2008 by former German ground forces soldier Kris Thaler, specializes in something very unique: designing weapons. If you need video game guns, you come to him.  “Believe it or not, I actually did not set out to start a company specialised in weapons,” he told me over email recently. Years back, Thaler uploaded some concept art to a message board he lurked on, looking for feedback. A few of the images included guns, and he was later contacted by a developer, interested in having Thaler work up ideas for their game. Thus, he doubled down on guns. Since then, Rmory has worked on everything from small independent projects like the XCOM-like strategy game  Xenonauts to the biggest crowdfunded game ever,  Star Citizen. “We focus on realistic feeling armaments for our clients that look cool and don't break the immersion in their product,” he said. Though Rmory does provide contractual services to drum up concepts for other military items—tanks, mechs, etc.—the primary reason companies seek Rmory out is firearms. Generally speaking, Thaler told me, the process begins with a company approaching Rmory about a game, sometimes asking for them to come up with a specific weapon they have in mind, or to fill in the details on a weapon they’re working on but need Rmory to flesh out. “For example, a client comes to us and says, ‘Hey we need a rocket launcher,’” he said. “We then work out details like ammo capacity, animations, alternate firing modes, etc. We then provide the client with all the visuals he needs to give the weapon to the next member in the production pipeline.” Even in fantasy settings, Thaler said Rmory tends to pull inspiration from the real-world. His favorite real gun is the German HK G3—”it has a lot of oomph”—while his favorite game gun is, shockingly enough, the Groovitron from Ratchet & Clank, which makes enemies dance. Thaler started shooting guns at 12-years-old, as soon as legally allowed. (That wouldn’t fly today. Germany has since adopted incredibly stringent gun control laws, in the wake of various mass shooting incidents, and in 2009, the country started a government database.)  He later joined the German military, where he was trained on everything from pistols to missle launchers. Thaler credits his time in the military with giving Rmory an edge. “I personally think it [my experience] makes or breaks believability,” he said. “You can read all you want about guns, but having handled them in different situations gives you a totally different perspective on them. Almost everybody can make a cool looking gun, but as soon as it feels unbelievable in game it breaks immersion, providing both is key.” Besides gun design, one of the services Thaler offers is “gun tactics,” in case a client “wants to know explicit use scenarios for guns or what calibre to use where, we got him covered.” When I pitched Thaler on talking to me, I mentioned this was part of a larger set of stories Waypoint was running about the relationship games have with guns, timed to the ongoing conversation the United States was having about mass shootings involving children. Given his profession—making virtual weapons— I wondered if moments like that gave him pause. “Of course,” he said, “any tragedy especially involving children do give you pause, and your thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the bereaved. But to bring it back around to our conversation—guns are not the problem, video games are not the problem. Crazy people are the problem, and, unfortunately, there will always be crazy people.” Though mental health is an important consideration when discussing how to deal with America’s gun problem—it comes up every single time this debate returns—new research suggests there’s not as much of a link between mental illness and gun violence as society generally presumes. According to The New York Times, a recent analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which involved a gun, revealed only 22 percent of attackers would have been classified as mentally ill. It’s even lower for annual gun homicides: 1 percent. In the case of Rmory, though, they’re working with and designing virtual guns, not real ones.  “One is a piece of a cultural good, the other is for self-defense,” said Thaler. Rmory is just one link in the larger relationship between games, guns, and firearms manufacturers—both real and imagined. A still shocking 2013 investigation by reporter Simon Parkin explored how gun creators co-op the popularity of games to increase awareness of their creations, often without players being aware. We know games don’t cause violence, a topic we explored in an interview with a research psychologist yesterday, but it remains true most of us spend  a lot of our time running around killing fields. And because of companies like Rmory, the weapons we’re running around with are, for better or worse, surprisingly authentic. Follow Patrick on Twitter.

512,512,19-06-19 00:00,2019,6,19,,Britain's Tesco says no timetable for 'finest' store launch,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, said it is considering a trial of an upmarket convenience store under the ‘Tesco finest’ banner but has not disclosed when or where a pilot will be launched.  Tesco hosted a capital markets day for analysts and investors on Tuesday at which it presented a slide flagging an opportunity for a ‘Tesco finest’ store concept with a 7% operating margin - significantly ahead of the group-wide target of 3.5% to 4%.   The premium ‘finest’ range of grocery products is Tesco’s most expensive.  “‘Tesco finest’ as a brand is one of the largest food brands in the country. We have a very high percentage of more upmarket customers,” Chief Executive Dave Lewis told reporters on Wednesday.  “The opportunity to curate that range and bring new things in a more convenient outlet is something that we have tested, is something we’re interested in.”  But Lewis said Tesco is: “Not at a place where we are saying we’re going to open this shop or this many shops.”  The CEO said the point of the capital markets day was to share with investors a number of growth opportunities Tesco is actively looking at without giving specific details on timings.      “No dates for any of the initiatives were given yesterday,” he said.  News of Tesco’s new concept sent shares in upmarket food retailer Marks & Spencer down as much as 4.5% on Wednesday on competition fears.  Last year Tesco launched the Jack’s chain to compete with German-owned discounters Aldi  and Lidl.  Other initiatives Tesco discussed on Tuesday include opportunities to sell more unique brands and online meal subscriptions, developing its Clubcard loyalty program with a subscription model, setting-up mini fulfillment centers at the back of stores for online grocery, and delivery robots.  Celebrating its 100th year, Tesco is deep into a recovery plan under Lewis after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in its fortunes.  He said in April Tesco had met, or would soon meet, most of the turnaround goals he set in 2016, including a key margin target of earning 3.5 to 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers spend by the end of its 2019-20 financial year.  Lewis said on Wednesday he did not issue a new margin target at the capital markets day.  “We said there was more opportunity for us to lower cost and that gave us the opportunity to invest back in the customer offer (and) new propositions, or if none of those were available then the opportunity would be to improve margin,” he told reporters.

515,515,12-08-18 00:00,2018,8,12,,More than 100 large wildfires in U.S. as new blazes erupt,"(Reuters) - Six large new wildfires erupted in the United States, pushing the number of major active blazes nationwide to over 100, with more expected to break out sparked by lightning strikes on bone-dry terrain, authorities said on Saturday.  More than 30,000 personnel, including firefighters from across the United States and nearly 140 from Australia and New Zealand, were battling the blazes that have consumed more than 1.6 million acres (648,000 hectares), according to the National Interagency Coordination Center.  “We are expecting that there will be more fire-starts today,” Jeremy Grams, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said in an interview on Saturday.  He said dry thunderstorms, which produce lightning but little rain, are expected for parts of the Rocky Mountain region, while the U.S. northwest has critical fire weather conditions that include strong winds and low relative humidity.  Firefighters were battling another day of extremely hot temperatures and strong winds on Saturday, the National Interagency Coordination Center said.  The fires have scorched states from Washington to New Mexico, with California among the hardest hit.   A mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire near Redding in northern California was killed in a car crash on Thursday, the eighth person to die in that conflagration.      The 190,873-acre (77,243-hectare) Carr Fire has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes.  About 100 miles (160 km) southwest of the Carr Fire, about 3,500 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 328,226 acres (132,828 hectares) as of Saturday and was the largest fire on record in California.

There were no details about the meeting, such as who might be in attendance, but it will focus on “what they [the industry]” can do about America’s gun violence problem. The Entertainment Software Association, the chief lobbying group for the video game industry, did not respond to an immediate request for comment about the meeting. [Update: See below for the ESA's newly-released statement.] In the wake of last month’s high school shooting in Florida, an anxious nation has quietly wondered when an administration happy to spend time, money, and resources handing out tax cuts to the rich and taking away health insurance from the poor might consider doing something—anything—about our mass shooting epidemic.  Instead, Trump has suggested everything from taking away the rights of due process to wondering if maybe those darn games might be the  real source of a problem plaguing a nation that did nothing after 20 elementary school kids were gunned down in 2012. ""We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed, and we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it,"" said Trump this week. This isn't the first time Trump has weighed in on this question, either. ""I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” he said. “And you go the further step, and that’s the movies.

It’s a deal that Amazon is interested in because it’s looking to bring new shoppers to the company who click on “affiliate links” embedded on publishers’ websites. As Peter Kafka writes, “If any of the deals get finalized, they will mark a new chapter for Amazon,” as it will be the first time the company has “paid publishers in advance to make specific kinds of videos or other content” — as well as “an indicator that even though Amazon dominates online commerce, it still thinks it needs help getting shoppers inside its giant site.” It’s not known how much Amazon is considering paying publishers, “though it’s enough for several publishers to take seriously.”[Peter Kafka / Recode] [Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox?

In a recent interview on CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he’s “frustrated that tech is painted as monolithic” and that his company is different than companies like Google and Facebook. As Emily Stewart writes, “Apple has for a long time been beating the drum about it being better than the other tech giants on privacy,” and Cook’s comments show that “Apple has upped its efforts to emphasize that it’s different,” especially in light of calls from politicians like Sen. Elizabeth Warren who believe big tech, including Apple, should be broken up. “I don’t think anybody would call us a monopoly,” said Cook, who made the case that Apple has only a 15 percent share in the world on smart phones and eight or nine percent on personal computers.[Emily Stewart / Recode] Several lawsuits reveal a pattern of alleged discrimination toward pregnant warehouse workers at Amazon. A new report from CNET examined seven different lawsuits filed by pregnant women who were fired from their jobs at Amazon warehouses over the last eight years. The women reportedly endured limited bathroom breaks and heavy lifting, against their doctors’ advice. “Amazon wants to push out as much product as possible,” said one of the plaintiffs, Beverly Rosales. “They need as many people that don’t need accommodations to work there. They care more about the numbers than their employees.” Amazon, meanwhile, denied the allegations. A spokesperson for the company said that “[i]t is absolutely not true that Amazon would fire any employee for being pregnant; we are an equal opportunity employer.” The company, which employes 600,000 people, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years for its working conditions at its warehouses around the world.[Alfred Ng and Ben Fox Rubin / CNET] Two top senators are urging the FTC to move faster with their investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen.

They also called a potential fine in the range of billions of dollars a “bargain” for the social giant.

520,520,17-06-19 00:00,2019,6,17,,Hong Kong regulator probing book-building for equities and bonds,"HONG KONG, June 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s securities regulator is reviewing how banks build books for equity and debt capital raisings, one of the city’s top regulators said on Monday, warning about potential conflicts of interest.  So-called “books” are built by banks as they take in orders for equity deals such as initial public offerings, or for bond sales, by companies. The book is the basis from which bankers and their clients allocate shares or bonds to investors in each deal.  The move comes as the process of selling securities is coming under scrutiny elsewhere in the region. Last year Australian authorities filed criminal charges against ANZ and the local units of Citigroup and Deutsche Bank and six senior bankers over the sale of A$3 billion ($2.17 billion) in ANZ shares in 2015.  Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission conducts inspections when it identifies trends, emerging risks or compliance lapses that it feels may require a regulatory response.  “If [underwriting syndicates] submit fictitious and inflated orders or provide inducement to investors, they would undermine the discovery of IPO prices, the fair allocation of securities to subscribers, and ultimately investor confidence in the integrity and transparency of the capital market,” Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of the SFC, told the regulator’s annual compliance forum.  Last year the SFC published the findings of a review into investment banks’ activities when sponsoring, or leading, IPOs. In March of this year, it banned UBS from sponsoring IPOs for a year, while fining it and its Wall Street rivals a combined $100 million for due diligence failings.  Leung also said on Monday that the SFC was conducting a review into licenced corporations’ cybersecurity practices, and was looking at spreads charged by licenced corporations when trading bonds.

521,521,23-01-19 15:00,2019,1,23,Sarah Kliff,"Under Trump, the number of uninsured Americans has gone up by 7 million","The number of Americans without health insurance has increased by 7 million since President Donald Trump took office, new Gallup data released Wednesday shows. The country’s uninsured rate has steadily ticked upward since 2016, rising from a low of 10.9 percent in late 2016 to 13.7 percent — a four-year high. The uninsured rate is still well below where it was in 2013, before the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of health insurance coverage began. But under the Trump administration, a trend of Americans gaining coverage through the private marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion appears to be reversing. Certain demographic groups are experiencing a greater loss of coverage than others. Gallup data shows, for example, that Americans who are younger and lower-income have seen a greater decline in insurance coverage than those who are older and wealthier. Women have had insurance rates decline more quickly than men. This trend is especially surprising given that over the same time period, the unemployment rate has been declining. Usually, when more people have jobs, it means more people with access to employer-sponsored health insurance. But even during this period of job growth, America’s uninsured rate keeps climbing. The Affordable Care Act is still standing law. Republicans weren’t able to repeal Obamacare when they controlled both houses of Congress. And the one big change they did accomplish — repealing the individual mandate — didn’t go into effect until this year. So why was the uninsured rate rising from 2016 through 2018? There are probably a few factors at play that are worthing thinking about It’s not totally clear where this trend goes next. On the one hand, multiple states are beginning to expand Medicaid. Nebraska, Idaho, and Utah all passed ballot initiatives to expand the program for low-income residents in the 2018 midterms. Maine and Kansas are also likely to join the program this year. Those changes will increase the number of Americans with health insurance coverage. But there are other things happening that will depress those figures. More states are going to roll out work requirements for Medicaid. The individual mandate penalty goes away this year, meaning there is no longer a tax for not carrying health insurance coverage. And the Trump administration isn’t likely to restore Obamacare’s outreach and enrollment budget anytime soon. All those trends are likely to decrease the number of Americans who have health insurance coverage for years to come.",https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18194228/trump-uninsured-rate-obamacare-medicaid,,Vox
522,522,18-10-17 16:20,2017,10,18,John Patty,"If we’re being honest, the GOP has no agenda","This post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system. agenda, noun: A plan of things to be done or problems to be addressed. The problem with Republicans’ agenda in Washington is that there is no plan. Indeed, the real problem is not even that there is no plan: It is that the fact there is no plan is plainly visible and not even denied. Regardless of whether we think the current situation represents one of “unified government,” the reality is that regardless of who is in the White House, the congressional Republicans have remained largely unchanged over the past few years. Accordingly, the fact that they are unable to come up with a common plan — or even a common set of talking points — speaks volumes about how the realities of President Trump’s America interact with the “weak party system” of the United States federal government. Trump is president. The remainder of his party in Congress is subject to elections, and challenges, on a different schedule. Given that members of Congress typically value reelection but do not need Trump’s permission to seek it, Trump’s power over them is effectively limited to his power to persuade voters and help secure or deter their reelection goals. This power, it turns out, is finite. For example, consider the (ironically labeled) Strange special election in Alabama, in which Luther Strange — the putative insider candidate, with Trump’s (admittedly tepid) endorsement — lost to outsider candidate Roy Moore. Accordingly, Trump’s ability to enforce party discipline through his power to endorse is clearly limited. While Trump’s electoral power is circumscribed, his ability (and apparent willingness or proclivity) to cause electoral problems is seemingly unbounded. For example, consider the absolute mess created by Trump’s late-night kinda-sorta rescission of cost-sharing subsidy payments for health care insurance, or the desolate wasteland of unnecessary backlash initiated by his invocation of one of the most sensitive of duties of the commander in chief (contacting the relatives of armed services members who lost their lives in the line of service). The Republican Party has, collectively, not only consistently missed opportunities to make headway but has endured self-inflicted wounds on an astonishingly regular basis. Describing those two (of many) missteps requires at least two mouthfuls with a breath in between. In fact, together they represent an abomination with respect to Trump’s putative role as leader of the GOP. The fact that describing his missteps is so wordy and convoluted simply and vividly illustrates the crap storm that the GOP has inherited and seemingly countenances under his leadership. To validate the assertion that “the GOP seemingly countenances” said crap storm, I simply note that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met with Mr. Trump for lunch on Monday to declare that they “are together totally on this agenda...” My point here is not that the GOP should necessarily pursue its agenda or not; it’s rather a plea for coherence. After all, a “do nothing government” is at least doing nothing. In contrast, the GOP is currently occupying a huge swath of bandwidth with the equivalent of an animated GIF of the party shooting itself in the foot over and over. The good news is that fixing this should be easy. Here’s one simple guide to doing so: I could dig deeper about other “priorities” for the GOP prior to 2018, but realistically, getting a real budget — not a contrived continuing resolution — passed seems to be a stretch. Tax reform is “possible,” and worth going after, from a programmatic/agenda perspective. But none of it happens if the GOP doesn’t set repealing the ACA to the side for the time being. An apocryphal quote attributed to Albert Einstein is a fitting send-off: Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell would be well advised to keep this in mind as they plot out the few months remaining before the midterm election cycle gets into full swing.",https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2017/10/18/16496740/republican-party-no-agenda,,Vox
523,523,02-08-17 19:20,2017,8,2,Callie Beusman,"If You Support Anti-Abortion Democrats, You Should Expect Anti-Woman Policy","Most recently, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Ben Ray Luján told  The Hill that the party will continue to provide funding to candidates who oppose abortion rights. ""There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,"" he said. His comments immediately attracted the ire of several reproductive rights advocacy groups: NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue lambasted them as indicative of ""an ethically and politically bankrupt strategy,"" and Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards tweeted that reproductive rights are ""non-negotiable,"" adding that her organization will ""hold any politician who says otherwise accountable."" In an emailed statement, DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa tepidly emphasized to Broadly that the Democratic Party platform is pro-choice. ""Tom Perez has stated previously that he is pro-choice,"" she added. ""That has not changed."" But even if the platform remains the same, top Democrats have hardly been vociferous in their defense of reproductive rights. In May, most notably, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the  Washington Post that abortion is ""kind of fading as an issue"" for Democratic voters. Unfortunately, abortion is not fading as an issue for conservative legislators. While the Democrats have been wringing their hands and assuring media that they don't believe in ideological purity tests, the political arm of the anti-abortion movement has continued forging ahead with startling efficacy. In the past seven years, nearly 350 restrictions on abortion access have been enacted. In the past few months, we've seen states passing particularly cruel and byzantine legislation: laws mandating that aborted or miscarried fetuses must be buried or cremated, laws that would require women to notify their rapists before getting an abortion, and laws that would essentially ban terminations after 13 weeks. That the Democrats are willing to submit to the anti-abortion movement isn't really a new development. ""We have so many anti-choice Democrats in state houses… [who] have really been helping to pass a lot of the anti-choice restrictions that we see today,"" Renee Bracey Sherman, the senior public affairs manager at the National Network of Abortion Funds, told Broadly over the phone. ""We didn't get to seven states with one abortion clinic with just the Republican Party. There were Democrats that helped."" When pundits and politicians argue that Democrats should ""compromise"" on abortion or to rethink their approach to the subject, they tend to speak in vague absolutes. Abortion is ""polarizing"" and ""divisive."" It ""alienates"" red-state voters. Framing it this way—as a fundamentally ideological debate, rather than one with tangible consequences—trivializes the real and pressing danger of restricting abortion access. Laws that limit abortion erode women's constitutional right to access full healthcare, endanger them, and enshrine into law the idea that their basic bodily autonomy matters less than the belief that an embryo is sacrosanct. When women cannot safely and legally terminate their pregnancies, some resort to dangerous and illegal alternatives, like the estimated hundreds of thousands of women in Texas who've performed DIY procedures, or the women across the country who have risked arrest to self-induce an abortion. Those who are forced to carry to term against their will face dire consequences as well: Research shows that women who are denied abortion care are three times more likely to end up below the federal poverty level after two years, and less likely to be able to leave abusive partners. Supporting a staunchly anti-abortion candidate isn't a harmless ideological ""compromise""—it's capitulation to a dangerous, blatantly repressive agenda, one that can have profound effects on women's ability to access crucial healthcare services. Take, for instance, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who ran on an anti-abortion platform and received the inaugural leadership award from Democrats for Life of America in 2016. ""The future of the Democratic Party is a stake,"" the organization's executive director said in a typo-riddled press release at the time. ""And, John Bel Edwards shows that Democrats can gain victories in Red States like Louisiana, if the party is willing to reverse course, listen to the voters, and support pro-life candidates.""  If politicians like Edwards are the future of the Democratic Party, it's an extremely bleak one for women and families. As governor, Edwards signed into law a series of extremely draconian measures, making Louisiana one of just seven states to require women to wait three full days before getting an abortion and attempting to defund Planned Parenthood despite a massive STD epidemic in the state. Under Edwards, the number of clinics in the state dropped to three, down from seven in 2011.  Enabling a bipartisan attack on women's right to healthcare in the name of party unity is only a viable solution if you're fine with forcing people to bear children against their will. If this is true of the Democratic Party, they can't claim, as they currently do, to ""unequivocally"" believe ""that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured."" I agree that the Democrats need to change the way they address abortion. Instead of weakly and ineffectively gesturing towards reproductive justice as some kind of nebulous progressive ideal, they need to actually stand up for the women they represent and fight to protect their rights.

The billionaire philanthropist points to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 call to put a man on the moon as a shining example of a world leader bringing public and private sectors together for the betterment of society. ""In the face of fear, President Kennedy successfully summoned our country to harness American ingenuity and advance human progress,"" Gates writes. Because of Kennedy's exhortation, we now have complex weather mapping tools and satellites that give us turn-by-turn directions. Gates believes it's imperative that the next president of the United States — and other world leaders — tackle equally important challenges. Here are the four he sees as the highest priorities.

Provide everyone on earth with affordable energy, without contributing to climate change.






 Finding alternatives to carbon-emitting fuels is one of the most pressing challenges of the coming decades. Gates writes that within the next eight years, we could see significant declines in our reliance on such fuels — if resources are devoted to new research and initiatives. A decade from now, we could be using batteries to power our cars and renewable energies like wind and solar to run our towns and cities.

Develop a vaccine for HIV and a cure for neurodegenerative diseases.






 Curing diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's, which are both destructive and expensive, would mark an enormous leap forward in scientific achievement. Likewise, science is moving ever closer to eradicating HIV, which is already highly manageable. ""Based on recent progress, I believe world leaders could help make an effective AIDS vaccine a reality within the next decade,"" Gates writes. ""And with a vaccine, we would be on the path to ending the disease altogether.""

Protect the world from future health epidemics.






 Epidemics stemming from infectious diseases are fast-moving and scary. Science can stop their spread fairly well, but to prevent a large-scale outbreak from occurring in the future, Gates argues that governments need to work closely with private research. If an outbreak does occur, ""we will need to be able to detect it, develop a test for it, and produce cures very quickly,"" he writes.

 Gates strongly supports personalized education as the primary way kids around the world should learn. Technology is finally letting teachers tailor lessons to each student based on their individual needs, so curricula and pedagogy should evolve accordingly.

527,527,23-11-17 16:48,2017,11,23,Premila D'Sa,Here’s What University Students Have On Their Dorm Walls,"I read a while back that the stars of  13 Reasons Why (Netflix’s problematic teen drama) Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford decided that their characters would have matching Arcade Fire posters in their bedrooms. This happened because Minette is a big fan and both actors thought the posters fit their characters personalities. I think they were right, because I thought the two leads were the most pretentious people alive when I watched the show, and the abstract Arcade Fire posters were the cherry on top. Is that what they intended? Maybe not. Am I wrong for thinking Arcade Fire posters are pretentious? I don’t think so. But it illustrates an important point: people (like me) are going to judge you based on what you have on your walls. Your “Live Laugh Love” poster is going to say a lot more about you than  anything you could actually say. Especially in college, where your drunk floormates are inevitably going to end up in your dorm room looking at them. So VICE ventured into college dorms to check out what students are putting up on their walls and ask them what they want people to think.   Please explain this very moody poster of teen idol Shawn Mendes.   Adyn: OK, so at first we liked him “ironically” but the more we listened to him, it became a real thing.  Mateus: Yeah, we really like him now.  Adyn: So we bought the poster off Amazon and put it up.  Have you guys seen him live?  Mateus: Yeah, we saw him at WE Day in Toronto two years ago. He was really good.  What do people think when they see the poster?  Adyn: We have to explain to people that we actually like him. It’s not ironic anymore. He makes good music!  Both of you also have Montreal Jazz Fest posters in your rooms. It’s a pretty big cultural shift from Shawn Mendes.  Adyn: Well, we like Shawn Mendes and we like jazz. It’s a taste of both worlds.  VICE: You’ve got a lot of Lady Gaga and RuPaul going on.  Daniella: Well, they’re like pretty much mostly gay people, because I’m gay. It’s just all of my favorite people, I just think they’re really beautiful and having queer beauty and art up on my walls is really inspiring to me, and it makes me feel really beautiful.   What do you think people who walk into your room think about them? Do a lot of people recognize the RuPaul stars? People who aren’t familiar with it are always kind of surprised. But I have mostly queer friends, so that doesn’t happen a lot. With this Gaga poster, people are always like “woah, what’s going on with her eyes?” People are always very inquisitive about them.   Why those specific Gaga posters? They’re pretty wild. They’re both from  ArtPop which is my favorite album and I just like how they look.  You got some art on your other wall? Yeah, I want to kind of shift from those fandom posters and move towards art that I resonate with.   I guess it’s a more “mature” aesthetic? Yeah, I’m kinda getting there.  VICE: Explain your poster collection.  Cameron: It’s mostly Nicki Minaj, but a lot of other cool, badass people too. It’s a collection of the people who represent who I want to be,  Lts of Nicki. Did you see that PAPER magazine cover? Yeah, I’m actually getting that blown up and putting it on the wall. I want to fill the entire space.  It’s a pretty expansive collection for one wall. Yeah, sometimes they don’t stick! In the mornings I’m ready to wake up and look at them and they’re all on the ground. They just fall on me during the night, it’s pretty sad.  It is because you’re using scotch tape? They don’t let you nail stuff on in dorms.  So how do people react when they walk in here and see all of this? People are mortified! They don’t expect it. The first time my roommate walked in I could tell he was shocked.   Do you think your roommate likes them? No, he doesn’t. But I don’t care.  You got some artsy fandom posters going on. Yeah, I got Sherlock and some Pokémon. They’re all from FanExpo. I get them from the Artist’s Alley.   Why do you buy artists’ renditions instead of actual posters? I just think they’re a bit cooler. I like seeing artists at cons and supporting them.  Do you get a lot of people coming in here being like “Sherlock!” No. No one really recognizes the show.  VICE: You’ve got a lot of black tape going on. Take me through your walls.  Tristan: OK so my first wall, it’s “The Wall of Fame,” I’ve got that written in black tape. And then I stick whatever art I’m into right next to it. I’m usually sticking up a T-shirt. But this way people know what’s going on.  You just stick up a T-shirt with black duct tape? Yeah, I treat them like art, like posters.  This wall has “T-Bone” written on it, what does that mean? It’s my nickname.  Do people actually call you that? Yeah.  What’s this wall here? You’ve got a “T” inside a rectangle. Yeah okay so “T” is my intial, and it’s inside— that was supposed to be a square not a rectangle. Anyways, the “T” is me and it’s in the box because it’s like a reminder to “think outside the box” you know.  But the “T” is in the box? Yeah, because  you’ve got to think of it outside the box.  OK, cool. Yeah, it’s very abstract. I’ve also got this tapestry that has all the major American Dolls on it, but it’s too heavy to put up. I tried but it keeps falling down.  Wait, what. Why do you own this? It’s just cool, it’s got all the dolls on it. It’s classic.  What do you think other people think of it? They’d probably think it’s cool too, when they see it. Got to figure out how to get it up.  VICE: You’ve got exclusively film posters.  Sawyer: Yeah, I’m a film student so I decided people should be able to tell, so I got a bunch of movie posters and put them up.  What do you think people think of the movies you’ve picked? I think I’ve picked some classic ones,  The Godfather, Back to The Future, movies that everyone likes. Hopefully people think I’ve got good taste and stuff. I mean, I am in film.  You’ve got   Pulp Fictio n up here too. Do you think it’s Tarantino’s best? Dude yeah, easily.  You’ve got a space theme going on here, was that intentional?  Nuvaira: Nah. I just really like  Space Odyssey because I used to watch it all the time when I was younger. And this tapestry with the girl and the moon, I just thought it was cool. Like how she’s alone in solitude, looking at the moon. It’s peaceful.  What do people think when they see you poster? The first thing people always ask me is whether I’ve actually seen the film.  Have you actually seen the film? Yes!  I believe you. Where’d you get the poster from? My university has these posters sales. I always check stuff out. This was the only poster liked and it was my favorite movie so I got it. It’s a really nice poster, really pretty.  VICE: What do you think your posters say about you?  Kiki: I think they show that my taste is all over the place cause there's no real running theme with them, I have the Travis Scott album cover and then like a poster about Lincoln's assassination and another one about Frida Kahlo so it just indicates that I like a lot of different things I suppose.  What do people usually say when they see them? People usually comment on the  New Yorker covers saying they really like them or are kind of curious about the Lincoln poster. One person said they didn't even know Lincoln had been assassinated, so I'm glad my posters can be educational too.  The   New Yorker covers are really nice. Where did you get them? The  New Yorker covers I bought outside the Met for like two bucks apiece and I just really liked how they complimented each other. One's the city during sunset and the other is the city at dusk so they just look really nice side by side. And I love the  New Yorker.  Why the little Frida Kahlo portrait? I've just always loved her and how unashamed she was to be herself and be an independent woman at a time when it was harder to do so. My mom brought me back that portrait from Mexico when she went last winter.  You got things like the   New Yorker and Frida Kahlo, do you ever worry that people will think you’re a pretentious snob or something? Honestly it's never crossed my mind, but now I’m slightly worried.

Roughly 45 percent of people who immigrated into the US since 2010 to have college degrees The number of foreign-born people living in the US in 2017 reached its highest level since 1910, according to data compiled by the US Census Bureau. The agency's figures for 2017 show that 13.7% of the US population included people born in another country, which represented roughly 44.5 million people. That number had risen slightly from the previous year, which was 13.5%, The New York Times reported Thursday. Foreign-born US residents reached their highest numbers at the beginning of the 20th century, when large waves of European immigrants left their home countries to escape poverty and violence. The influx drove the percentage of foreign-born people to nearly 15% in the US. As of 2017, the largest and second-largest of the groups had arrived from Asia and Latin America, respectively, a report from the Brookings Institution said. Nearly three million Asian immigrants have arrived in the US since 2010, with the majority hailing from China and India. More of the people arriving to the US from other countries held college degrees than groups who arrived in years prior. ""This is quite different from what we had thought,"" William Frey, the Brookings Institution researcher who conducted the analysis, told The New York Times. ""We think of immigrants as being low-skilled workers from Latin America, but for recent arrivals, that's much less the case."" New York and California, which are both sanctuary states and considered to be immigrant-friendly, witnessed their foreign-born populations rise by 6% since 2010.

530,530,30-03-17 21:26,2017,3,30,Matthew Yglesias,Trump is still tweeting angrily about the Freedom Caucus,"Republican leaders have been complaining for years about the Freedom Caucus, the group of hard-right House members who live to annoy the party brass. But they’ve never taken a shot so public, vocal, and direct as what Donald Trump tweeted today — basically calling Freedom Caucus members electoral enemies on a par with the Democratic Party. The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! Thursday evening, Trump renewed his (so far one-sided) Twitter fight against Freedom Caucus leaders, suggesting they would hold up his desired tax overhaul too: If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform. Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador?#RepealANDReplace #Obamacare Coming from any other president in living memory, this would be a clear warning that the president is prepared to back primary challenges against House members who issue conservative dissents from his agenda. Trump, however, has a tendency to say things without necessarily meaning them. As we saw during the AHCApocalypse last week, he enjoys bluffing as a political strategy — as when he threatened to force the House to hold a doomed vote on the American Health Care Act so that everyone in the caucus would have to go on record as a friend or a foe, only to demur at the last minute when Paul Ryan pointed out to him that this would create huge political problems for his members. So Trump is probably just bluffing here, too. At least that’s how I would interpret it. (Also, the historical track record of presidents trying to back primary challenges to incumbent members of Congress is dismal.) Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokesperson, declined to clarify, telling NBC News that “the tweet speaks for itself.” It’s worth noting that while the Freedom Caucus certainly has been known to scuttle the GOP’s best-laid plans in the past, it’s far from clear that this is really what happened with the Obamacare repeal effort. Many moderate or vulnerable House Republicans had serious doubts about the bill, and the legislation, as written, wasn’t going to make it through the Senate. It’s possible that if every single Freedom Caucus member had been prepared to vote for the AHCA it would have passed the House, but that’s far from certain. And even if it had passed the House, the basic reality that the bill was too extreme and poorly designed to pass the Senate would have forced major modifications. All of which suggests Trump might be better served blaming the bill’s architects — including himself.",https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15121624/trump-freedom-caucus-tweet,,Vox
531,531,08-11-16 00:00,2016,11,8,Tara Golshan,Where early voting stands going into Election Day,"As the candidates make their closing arguments before Election Day, millions of Americans have already cast their ballots for the presidential election. At least 42 million citizens have voted early, with more than 18 million ballots cast in battleground states. This is a bit of a drop-off from 2012, when 46 million people voted early. Since early voting is a sign of enthusiasm for the candidates, it’s an indication that fewer voters were motivated to get to the polls early — perhaps due to the unpopularity of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So far, this what we know from early voting results: More women have voted than men, Latino voter turnout is so far at an all-time high, and black voter turnout is still below the last presidential election, when Barack Obama was on the ballot. The results are a mixed bag for Clinton and Trump, and as I have reported throughout, it’s tough to draw conclusions from early voting numbers — different states have different early voting laws and report ballot returns inconsistently, and drawing conclusions based on party affiliation is fallible at best. But on a bigger scale, the early voting returns still seem to be following national polling: It’s a tighter race than Clinton would have hoped for, but there are some positive signs for the Democratic nominee going into Election Day. As my colleague Dara Lind writes, early voting has made a “serious case that the Latino ‘sleeping giant’ is finally rustling awake.” And it’s happening in a big way: In Arizona, Latinos have gone from 11 percent of the early voting electorate in 2012 to 13 percent this year. In Texas, Latino early voting rose 26 percent. In Florida, 152 percent. In North Carolina, an increase in early voting among Latinos in the face of restrictions has helped keep Democratic hopes alive in the state. In Nevada, a surge in the last few days of early voting made the state, according to state politics expert Jon Ralston, all but unwinnable for Republicans. It’s a good sign for Clinton: When the early voting periods were about to open, University of Florida early voting expert Michael McDonald told CNBC, ""There is speculation that Trump's rhetoric could entice Hispanics to vote against him, and there is some evidence in polls that Hispanic voting enthusiasm is running higher than normal."" His prediction has seemingly come to fruition, and it’s bad news for Trump in Florida, a state the Republican nominee cannot afford to lose. The Clinton campaign is hoping the surge in Latino voting will counteract what has been a small decline in the black vote in states like North Carolina — as well as Clinton’s terrible numbers among non-college-educated whites. Initial alarm bells over Clinton’s alleged “black voter problem” went off last week in Florida, where African Americans were slower to turn out than in the past two elections. It’s not particularly surprising that Clinton’s early black voter turnout numbers weren’t matching Obama’s. But results have drastically improved, since those earlier reports — University of Florida early voting expert Daniel Smith called it “old news” at this point, projecting that total black voter turnout in Florida will actually be higher in 2016 than it was in 2012. Total black turnout in Florida in 2016 will be higher than 2012. Mark it.At 777k as of yesterday. Souls to polls today. VBM & ED to come That’s not the case in North Carolina, however, which has seen an 8.7 percent decline — about 66,000 votes — in black voter turnout, much of which has been attributed to more restrictive early voting rules, including earlier poll closures. Trump and Clinton seem to be close to a dead heat in North Carolina, but a breakdown of the Obama coalition is a better sign for Trump. Even so, Clinton’s overall strength on the electoral map may prove to hold her up, and while polls remain tight in states like Nevada, Clinton has also been able to grow a substantial margin in early voting — Democrats are up 6 points — which could prove to be a firewall come Election Day. Early voting is usually a good measure of enthusiasm; lots of early voters means lots of decided voters. And while there doesn’t seem to be much enthusiasm for either candidate this year, there is some speculation that people voting against the opposing candidate rather than affirmatively voting for their candidate might bring people to the polls. Paul Gronke, director of the Early Voting Information Center and a professor of political science at Reed College, said this could play out among the minority vote. ""Trump continues to make statements that alienate African-American voters, and he struggles to get beyond 2 percent in some state polls. Under that circumstance, and faced with a well-oiled Democratic [get-out-the-vote] machine, why would African-American voters wait?"" he told me in September, noting that Trump also doesn’t seem to have much of an early voter ballot-chasing operation, which has been effective in getting out the Republican vote. It is also an effective way to show the campaigns where to focus their day of get-out-the-vote resources. And that could make the difference with some demographics. According to a recent poll from the African American Research Collaborative, black voters do recognize the stakes of the election. And while they are not as enthusiastic about Clinton as they were about Obama, Trump’s dog-whistling to white nationalist voters has resonated negatively among African-American voters; the “perceived importance” of voting for the president is higher this year than it was in 2012. In other words, black voters are still committed to casting their ballots this cycle. ""All of this might lead to an early electorate that is even more Democratic and more diverse than in the Obama elections — but all of this is contingent on all kinds of assumptions,"" Gronke said. There has been a shift in early voting demographics in the past two decades. ""Prior to 2008, these ‘decided’ early voters matched demographic patterns that are well-established in American politics,"" Gronke said; they were older, educated, wealthier, ideological, and highly partisan. And for the most part, particularly with mail-in voters, these early voters mostly leaned Republican, which can also be attributed to a strong GOP push for mail-in absentee voting in the 1990s and 2000s. Meanwhile, in-person early voters tend to lean more toward Democrats. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign made a big stride with Democratic in-person early voting in 2008, targeting areas with higher Democratic voter potential — areas that also had higher populations of African-American voters. Black churches used Sunday services to push people to the polls in what they called ""souls to the polls"" initiatives, University of Wisconsin Madison political scientist Barry Burden recalls. In 2012, more restrictive early voting laws also served as a mobilization tool to get out the vote, Gronke notes. “It ended up being nearly impossible to extract out the impact of the laws from the impact of the campaign,” he said. For the most part, 2016 remains consistent with these trends. Notably, Democrats and the Clinton campaign have focused this year’s efforts on mail-in voting. They have had tangible results in states like Florida, where voter registration between Democrats and Republicans has evened out. While “compared to in-person early voting, absentee voting patterns in Florida do not deviate as much from 2012,” as Burden notes, Republicans don’t lead Democrats with as wide a margin in absentee voting this year. And according to the Clinton campaign, more African Americans requested mail ballots in this election than ever before. Clinton may not have the same pull this year. But it’s still early to tell, and as University of Florida’s McDonald wrote for the Huffington Post Sunday, Democrats still have a lot of unreturned ballots in their hands: Second, there are 71,700 more Democrats than Republicans who have requested mail ballots but have not returned them. While Democrats typically have a problem with unreturned mail ballots, my sense is given this lopsided number that at some point Democrats will start achieving at least daily parity in the returned mail ballots. It’s important to remember — as a general scan of contradicting headlines on early voting from the New York Times to Fox News will show you — that it’s still early to say definitively that these early voting numbers indicate final results: “It is quite difficult to discern what the election results will be from early voting numbers,” Burden said. “The patterns do not tell a coherent national story. … Ballots are coming in at different rates for the parties in each state. The messages appear to differ from one state to the next.” And as McDonald warns in his weekly update on the early voting numbers for Huffington Post: “These are still early hints of the direction of the election. There is still much time left in the election, and these numbers can be affected by how election officials run the election, campaign strategies to mobilize voters, and voters’ behaviors.” There are a lot of limitations: States reporting early voting totals don’t always include all counties; some states, like North Carolina, require party registration, while others, like Wisconsin, don’t; and numbers derived from party registrations are fallible. These distinctions can explain some of the early results. University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket crunched the numbers for FiveThirtyEight on how well early voting numbers predicted the final tally in past elections. He simply concluded, “The relationship is positive, but it’s pretty noisy. In other words, knowing how a party is doing in early voting doesn’t tell you much about how it will do once all the votes are counted.” In fact, he found that looking at early voting numbers in 2012 would give you “wildly misleading” results: Democrats maintained substantial leads among early voters in North Carolina, Louisiana and West Virginia, and were trailing by a relatively narrow margin in Oklahoma, but still lost those states when all the votes were counted. Republicans won early voters in Pennsylvania and Colorado but lost the final tallies there. Maryland was a safely Democratic state in 2012, but the 75 percent of the early vote that went the Democrats’ way was a far cry from the 63 percent of the total vote they won once voting was finished. Even so, it seems like on a macro level, early voting supports national polling — which might be a sign of relief for Clinton voters.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13541612/where-early-voting-stands-election-day,,Vox

If you’re on public transport, make sure that you’re either already folded into a cramped plastic seat or take a firm grip on one of the overhead straps. And if you’re walking, then put this down until you’ve reached your destination.  What we’re about to tell you is shocking, and you might need a few minutes to quietly process this information. If you’re ready, read on: According to investigators from the Michigan Liquor Control Commission (MLCC), a bar that allows its patrons to get wasted while throwing axes at wooden targets was (temporarily) deemed unsafe.    We know. We couldn’t believe it either, but the MLCC suspended Hub Stadium’s liquor license for one day, as a result of what it called “a significant threat to the public health ... at this establishment.” According to MLive, the suspension to give Hub Stadium time to address some of the investigators’ concerns and to develop new safety procedures. In addition, the Commission said that Hub’s owner’s failed to mention that its patrons would be throwing axes when it applied for its license.   “It is our job to make sure that the health, safety and welfare concerns of the public are taken into account wherever alcoholic beverages are sold in the state of Michigan,” MLCC chairman Andy Deloney said in a statement. (The Commission did say that it did not regulate axe-throwing in bars or other establishments, nor was it against the law for sporting activities—presumably including axe-throwing—to be held inside booze-serving establishments).   Some of the concerning scenarios that the MLCC’s investigators witnessed during their visit to Hub included patrons drinking alcohol while they threw axes and axe-throwers wearing open-toed shoes. Then they started scrolling through Hub’s social media postings, and  hooo boy, they saw some things; among their other concerns were photos and videos of “patrons throwing axes at bottles of spirits [and] consuming shots from the bottle that was not struck,” a person throwing two axes at once, three “coaches” throwing axes at the same target, a person bouncing the axe off the floor in an attempt to hit the target, and someone walking barefoot on a tightrope-style strap while he or she threw an axe. (OK, we’d actually like to see that last one.)   Hub’s license was suspended on September 10 and, at a hearing which took place before the suspension, Hub’s management said that they “had implemented some of the changes” that the MLCC had suggested.   According to AFAR, North America’s first commercial indoor axe-throwing facility opened in Toronto in 2011. Its owner, Matt Wilson, has since expanded his Backyard Axe Throwing League (BATL) to a dozen additional locations in the United States and Canada. A second axe-throwing chain, Bad Axe Throwing, has 24 locations scattered between the two countries. And there are legit dozens of others— check your local listings!—but Hub is possibly the first to have its liquor license suspended, even temporarily. (Although Revolution Axe, an as-yet-unopened axe-throwing bar in Everett, Massachusetts, has had three hearings in an attempt to get its own liquor license).   MUNCHIES has reached out to Hub Stadium for comment but has not yet received a response. We would also like to know more about that person on the tightrope.

The two leaders spoke after high-level U.S. and Chinese officials in Beijing last week failed to reach a consensus, with talks set to resume next week in Washington.   Trump struck a positive tone in announcing the call earlier on Tuesday, calling Xi “my friend” and pledging in a post on Twitter that “good things will happen” on trade.   Chinese state television said Xi told Trump China-U.S. relations were in an important phase.   “I attach great importance to bilateral relations, and cherish the good working relationship with Mr. President,” it quoted Xi as saying.  In a statement after the call, the White House said the U.S. president “affirmed his commitment to ensuring that the trade and investment relationship between the United States and China is balanced and benefits American businesses and workers.”  Chinese state media said Xi told Trump the two countries should strive to find a way to properly resolve trade disputes.  Xi said trade and economic relations had always been the ballast and propeller of U.S.-China relations. He described their talks last week on trade as “frank, efficient and constructive.”  “The two sides’ teams can maintain communication, and strive to find appropriate ways to resolve issues and achieve win-win outcomes,” Xi said.   China’s top economic official, Vice Premier Liu He, is scheduled to visit Washington next week to resume negotiations sparked by the Trump administration’s threat to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports.  Beijing has countered with its own planned tariffs on American goods.   The tariff threats have roiled U.S. and other stock markets in recent weeks amid fears that a trade war between the two economic powerhouses will hit global markets.  Trump won the White House in part over his harsh rhetoric on China and trade, and vowing to press Beijing over economic issues and make trade fair for the United States. Since taking office, he has also touted his personal relationship with Xi.  Last week, a seven-member U.S. delegation returned to Washington and briefed Trump on their meeting.   American negotiators, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, issued a lengthy list of demands, according to people familiar with the talks that the White House later called “frank” discussions. Chinese state media, after the meeting, struck a positive note.  Trump and Xi also discussed North Korea’s nuclear program during their call, according to both the White House and Chinese state media.

535,535,01-07-19 19:59,2019,7,1,Cameron Kunzelman,Video Game History Is More Than Just Software and Hardware,"When we talk about game history, we’re most often talking about familiar things: the Big Crash of the 1980s, the console wars of the 1990s, and the various business strategies of Sony and Microsoft jockeying for position in the early mid 2000s. ROMchip, a new open access academic journal dedicated to the history of games, is trying to get us to think a little more broadly about what the history of games  are and what they  could be.  Being an academic work, the journal is aiming for something more than a collection of anecdotes about consoles and lists must-play obscure game titles. The first issue is made up of work from scholars and writers who are collecting, contextualizing, and rethinking the history of games, game production, and the people who play. It has a big task in front of it. Co-editors Laine Nooney (who I have sat on academic panels with), Raiford Guins, and Henry Lowood argue in their opening editorial that video game history has a problem. As an academic field, it is hard to define, and the shape that it takes for one person might not be what it is for another. It still has big, conceptual questions that remain unresolved or unconsidered. As the editors suggest, it means that game history still has some big, unresolved questions: “What types of histories are being written? Whose history is being accounted for as well as not being accounted for?”  Any cursory search or YouTube scouring of “game history” will provide you with long accounts of specific companies or series, with the occasional video from The Gaming Historian or Kelsey Lewin. These public histories are mostly geared toward fans or aimed at people who want to learn more about fascinating devices such as a blood testing device for a Nintendo handheld. Academic history writing takes a slightly different angle, looking to fill in context and situate video games in a cultural and technological context. It’s less  look at this and more look at this whole world of things. The first issue of ROMchip centers on what the history of games might look like if we were more attentive to different perspectives instead of only being interested in forgotten peripherals. In a large polemical section of essays, writers take on the question of what games history should  be. For example, VICE’s own Austin Walker argues in his piece in the issue, what would a history of play that archived  feel of play look like? Or, as TreaAndrea M. Russworm writes, where is the history of games that takes seriously the contributions of black people to every sector of video games from Jerry Lawson’s and Edward Smith’s hardware and software designs to the fan labor of blerds and beyond. The array of concerns and potential ways of thinking game history bloom from there, from Patrick Harrigan’s suggestion that Civil War games be thought as public debates to Jodi A. Byrd’s demand that “a history of games be one that focuses on those submerged and contrary stories that counter the possessive logics of colonialism and imperialism.” This first issue also contains a section of interviews, one of which is with Tom Kalinske, whose tenure as president of Sega of America coincided with the anti-Nintendo, pro-Genesis attack ads that we associate with the console wars of the 1990s. The final section, titled “Materials,” is made up of two longform traditional academic articles, one of which deals with  Suffragetto, a board game from the early 1900s. Although it is written for an academic audience, I think that ROMchip is pretty accessibly written, and would be engaging for anyone who is trying to think of new ways of considering how we engage with, and think through, the history of games.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads “I’d rather see this than Andy Warhol any day!” a young Whitney visitor exclaimed to her friend Sunday afternoon, as she sprinted from the museum door to the lobby. As the atrium slowly filled with the scent of burning sage, protesters shouted, “We will not be silent” and “Decolonize this place.”  Members and supporters of activist group Decolonize This Place, alongside curious onlookers, arrived outside the Whitney just after noon. Visitors hoping for a selfie with Marilyn Monroe or a Campbell’s soup can print were treated to art of a different kind. Armed with colorful banners reading messages like “WHITNEY MUSEUM: NO SPACE FOR PROFITEER OF STATE VIOLENCE,” drums, a cowbell, and the aforementioned burning sage, protesters gathered on what one member aptly described as “a cold ass Sunday,” to lead a protest against Warren B. Kanders. Kanders is a Vice Chairman on the Whitney Board of Directors, and the owner of Safariland, a tear gas manufacturer whose products were used on immigrant families approaching the US–Mexico border, seeking asylum in the United States. He was also among those who provided “significant support” to the blockbuster Andy Warhol exhibit, From A to B and Back Again, according to the exhibition’s web page. “The immediate goal is that Warren Kanders must go,” said Marz Saffore, a member of Decolonize This Place. Saffore emphasized, however, that Kanders is only a symptom of a larger problem. Saffore continued, “That does not mean that there aren’t dozens and dozens of other issues within the board of trustees at the Whitney, or within the way that the Whitney shows art or who curates the art.” The protest, according to organizers, was in solidarity with but separate from the nearly 100 Whitney staff members who signed a letter expressing their dismay at Kanders’s presence on the board and requesting a new policy around trustee participation in exhibitions.  In response to that letter, Museum Director Adam Weinberg wrote in a statement: “Even as we are idealistic and missionary in our belief in artists — as established by our founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney — the Whitney is first and foremost a museum. It cannot right all the ills of an unjust world, nor is that its role.” Weinberg also called the museum “a safe space for unsafe ideas.” Maria Garcia from Comite Comadre, a group that supports asylum-seekers and fights against deportations, told Hyperallergic that the museum’s claims to be “a safe place for unsafe ideas,” as stated by Weinberg, is “a slap on the face of their workers and the public at large.” Weinberg’s response, says Garcia, “infantilizes and insults” the pain that her community is going through at the border.    To help spread the message of that pain, organizers fanned out across the plaza in front of the museum and at the entrance to the Highline, handing out flyers that read, in part: Need we remind Weinberg that “the laws of society” have included the legal sanctioning of slavery, the Indian Removal Act, Jim Crow laws, and indeed the entire juridico-economic regime of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism that underpins contemporary US society? We say to Weinberg: We are not fools. We know law is not justice. Your statement makes it clear which side you are on: the side of Safariland, and this we simply cannot accept. Passersby were largely receptive, stopping to ask the protesters questions and to take pictures and videos of them, even following protesters into the museum’s lobby around 1pm. Museum security tried to hold back the group with a series of lines, supposedly for a bag check, which ultimately failed when around 70 protesters pushed past the guards. They formed a circle that eventually overflowed the space between the gift shop and the ticket desk and lit sage, sang, chanted, and a series of speeches were delivered from members of the American Indian House, the Bronx-based Hydro Punk movement, and the New Sanctuary Coalition. Shellyne Rodriguez, a member of Decolonize This Place, told Hyperallergic that she felt compelled to protest today because, “If we do not shock and awe this museum with our anger and our rage, then we’re saying it’s okay. Who’s going to be the next person on the board? One by one, we need to hold these people accountable. It’s about time we start questioning where our philanthropy comes from.”  Rick Chavolla from the American Indian Community House in New York City, a nonprofit representing Indigenous communities in the city, told Hyperallergic, “Finding out that [Kanders] is CEO of Safariland was incredibly sad for us. Admittedly, it angered us to know that it’s someone who is responsible for tear-gassing our own Indigenous people in Standing Rock, and more recently, on the border.” The American Indian Community House has an ongoing collaboration with the Whitney Museum, a series of monthly events named “Socials,” which highlight Indigenous culture. The recent revelations, says Chavolla, put the next “Social” event, scheduled for February 22, 2019, in question. “We have to able to move forward in a way that we know that the museum is conscious of who their leadership is … If the Whitney Museum is not going to find a way to change that leadership, we are really going to have to rethink our ongoing relationship with them.” Around 1:30pm, the fire department arrived, apparently because of the increasing layers of smoke. Protesters were undaunted, shouting “Fire! Fire! Fire to the colonizers!” and demanded that if the sage were, in fact, a fire hazard, that they be allowed to put it out themselves. Eventually, the protesters relocated, and the action continued peacefully back outside.  Whitney representatives did not offer comment when reached prior to Sunday’s event and have not yet responded to followup requests.",https://hyperallergic.com/475198/activists-protest-at-whitney-museum-demanding-vice-chairman-and-owner-of-tear-gas-manufacturer-must-go/,,Hyperallergic
537,537,29-06-17 15:32,2017,6,29,Emily Guy Birken,I always ask myself the same question before buying something big,"Recently, my husband had to buy a new bathrobe. The old one, which had completely worn out after a decade of wear, was the exact same ridiculous pastel coffee mug robe that Brad Pitt sported ironically in the movie Fight Club. The coffee mug robe cost $188, and had been a gift from me because my husband simply could not bring himself to spend nearly $200 on something he was going to wear around the house on lazy mornings. He loved that intentionally ridiculous robe, but despite my urging him to replace it with the same one from the same boutique, he again balked at spending that kind of money on a bathrobe. No matter how often I pointed out that he'd be spending a little less than $19 a year on daily joy (assuming the replacement robe also lasted 10 years), I could not change his mind. This situation got me wondering, though. How do you decide whether it's worth it to spend $200 on a ridiculous bathrobe, $500 for a phone upgrade, or an additional $5,000 to get the trim package you really want on your new car? Here's the thought process you should go through to figure out if a major purchase is worth it. The big question: Is this an investment or an indulgence? The basic definition of an investment is something that will appreciate in value over time. Buying a house is a common example of an investment purchase. In addition, upgrading your flight to business class so that you can more easily get work done on the plane may be an investment (if you can truly commit to working in flight) since the cost of the upgrade will be more than covered by the money you make while working. But what about investments that appreciate in something other than monetary value? For instance, you might spend money on biweekly massages, which do not appreciate in financial value, but they do keep you pain- and stress-free, which might be worth far more to you than the cost of the massages. That is an investment in your physical and mental well-being, even if you never see a specific financial return. On the other hand, an indulgence is something that simply makes you feel good in the moment. You don't expect an indulgence — like buying your favorite gourmet coffee, driving a sporty car, or purchasing the latest trendy clothes — to appreciate in financial value. There is nothing wrong with spending money on indulgences, and in fact, they can be an important part of your budget. The problem is when you justify your indulgences by claiming they are investments. (See also: How One Nice Thing Can Ruin Your Whole Budget) How to tell the difference The fundamental disagreement that my husband and I have over the bathrobe comes down whether or not spending nearly $200 on it would be an investment or an indulgence. I believe that it's an investment in his daily happiness. He believes it's an indulgence, and therefore not worth the money. There are a couple of things to consider to help you figure out if your major purchase falls into one category or the other: Length of use In general, the longer you can get good use out of a product or service, the more likely it is that you are looking at an investment. That means that clothing fads are more likely to be indulgences, whereas well-made classic pieces like a suit or little black dress are more likely to be investments. Is there a possible substitute? If there is no other way you'd get the same feeling from another purchase, then it's likely that you're looking at an investment. For instance, you may feel more professional, put-together, and relaxed when you get a weekly manicure. Painting your own nails does not feel the same, and in fact, you feel less professional with your DIY manicure. That means your weekly manicure date is likely an investment in your positive outlook, rather than an indulgence. Just because it's an investment doesn't mean you should buy it Even though the big ticket item you want to buy will be an investment in your well-being, that doesn't necessarily mean you should buy it. Major expenditures can derail your finances, even if your purchase will appreciate in value in some way. Before you make your investment purchase, ask yourself if you can afford to make the purchase. If you can't, commit to saving up for it. (See also: 5 Mental Biases That Are Keeping You Poor) Know what you value Ultimately, determining whether or not you should make a major purchase is all about knowing the things you value most. Spending money on things that will appreciate in value — whether financial or emotional — can be a good investment. Spending money on things that will offer more fleeting value is generally an indulgence. Knowing which is which can help you decide when to spend, when to save, and when to just go ahead and buy the silly robe.

538,538,14-01-16 18:25,2016,1,14,THUMP Staff,7 Producers Reflect on David Bowie's Influence on Electronic Music,"In addition to his role as transformational deity to the rock and pop worlds, David Bowie left an indelible touch on electronic music. His mid-70s experimental work proved formative for a nascent avant-garde scene and a vast swath of DJs responded with tributes over the years, using his compositions as jumping-off points for head-spinning productions. But in the wake of the art-pop legend's death, it's become apparent that beyond his direct contributions to the dance world, he's had an immeasurable impact on the scene's younger practitioners. Techno pioneers, avant-pop luminaries, and ambient zoners alike all took to Twitter after his death to process the passing of an inspiration. Words always fail when grappling with the loss of an icon, and even moreso when attempting to distill a man who so readily defied easy definition. For this reason, THUMP reached out to a just a few of the producers and composers influenced and impacted by Bowie's life and work—including Tiga, ex-Emeralds member Steve Hauschildt, spaced-out experimentalist Maria Minerva, and more—to pay tribute to a man whose singular vision sparked several generations of auteurs and iconoclasts. Bowie was at the very core of believing you can be somebody strange and mysterious and creative and successful and cool and interesting and funny and intelligent all without compromise or contradiction. He was not a god or a guru or a hero (maybe a bit of those), but he was proof that it was possible. Living proof. The only argument you needed against the doubters and the garbage and the compromises. And he made the best music. I'm certainly not a scholar of his work, nor am I the most ardent fan of his entire discography. But David Bowie's music has touched my life at certain times like many others and has proved to be one of the more enduring legacies in popular music. You would be hard-pressed to find a person who can't find something to like across his discography, given his unique ability to both adapt and be transgressive simultaneously. When I was a teenager I inherited a worn copy of Station to Station from the remainder of my father's record collection from the 70s and 80s before I ever purchased my first vinyl LP. So his music has unintentionally had a kind of familial, relatable (not alien) quality to it for me from the beginning. Fast forward to the mid oughts at the onset of Emeralds. While stoned out of our gourds, our ""spiritual advisor"" Witchbeam blew our minds with the b-side to Low. 'What is this strange music that sounds like early Cluster doing on a David Bowie record?"" we thought. With regards to Low and the rest of the ""Berlin Trilogy,"" it's important to understand the contributions of both Visconti and Eno in tandem with Bowie if you're going to appreciate its influence on ambient music. But also keep in mind, they will always colloquially be David Bowie records and that is what is more important since many people who heard these records aren't really trying to pick them apart. Certainly it's apparent that tracks like ""Subterraneans"" and ""Art Decade"" were a kind of genesis of sorts; a precursor to Eno's Ambient 1: Music For Airports which would be released the following year. Equally as influential is the koto and string-synth heavy track ""Moss Garden"" on Heroes from the same year. In 2009, with an advance, I purchased an old Eventide Harmonizer and used it extensively on the recordings for the album Does It Look I'm Here. Only years later I would find out that it was the device creating many of the time-destroying, crazy artifacts on some of those tracks that blew my mind way back when. It's even more discernible on the Low bonus tracks 'Some Are' and 'All Saints' if you're keeping count. In any case I would say there has always been an underlying influence from his records despite the equipment and contributions of Visconti/Eno. It was ultimately Bowie's visions of the unseen which pushed the music forward to a new place I think. Rest in peace. I remember being 16 or so and pressing down the distortion pedal with my foot and playing the riff from ""Ziggy Stardust"" on my guitar. I felt like I owned the world. Those moments...that's whats music is all about. After that, David Bowie has followed me through my life with music in a lot of different ways. When I read about his death I just didn't find any words—and decided to record a short cover instead. That's why I love music. Music doesn't need words or explaining. Everyone has their own idea of Bowie. I was never a Bowie superfan and yet, his death comes as a complete shock. Bowie was the king of the self-styled, king of the working-class-gone-art-school—very authentic in that sense, despite all the different masks and personas. These days, it's rich kids who make artsy music, and the execs who tell 'em what to wear. In that sense, there will never be another Bowie. My favorite Bowie ""album"" is the B-side of Low, produced in collaboration with Brian Eno and Tony Visconti. A true masterpiece that pays homage to the Eastern Block (""Subterraneans,"" ""Weeping Wall,"" ""Warszawa""), something that I—as someone born in the USSR during its final years—truly appreciate. Bowie said he dove into this subject matter after living in sunny and coked-out Los Angeles (my current hometown). The result is a deeply cathartic voyage into... what it's like to come out on the other side. The other side of west/east, darkness/light, but also drugs. I can relate in so many ways. We have lost a true visionary. So many people felt they knew David Bowie because his identity shone through each mask he wore, every character he showed us. Every time he shifted characters, a slightly clearer picture of a remarkable person stood out in the erasure, and we recognized a bit of ourselves. Each bold new character broke through a wall that constrained us in our own lives. If you were trapped by outdated rules of gender, genre, race, culture, class, cliché or some musical pretense, you could see Bowie stride through the same wall and suddenly feel a little safer to be free. And he did it with a kind of captivating grace, musicianship and style that made it cool to be weird. This became his trademark more than any particular sound or image. For so many of us who are outsiders, musicians or artists, he showed us a way into ourselves by taking fascinating, elegant, terrifying risks. He didn't only cross boundaries, he stood right over them and refused to pick a side, until there wasn't a boundary at all. It's entirely fitting that one of his most famous songs is about standing at a wall, declaring that ""the shame was on the other side."" That wall, and so many others, are gone now, and so is he. But the feeling he gave us is still here. He let us be heroes. Now that David Bowie is dead and I am older and more experienced with life and music and the industry, my understanding of his grandeur is even deeper. He must have been an angel sent from heaven to shine this bright and deeply creative light upon us that will never ever let us go. He managed to touch all of us so deeply and profoundly. It's breathtaking. He means the world not only to his friends and family, but to all of us looking for more than just answers in music. He is it. He is the godfather of popular music and expression, style and performance, artistry and fame. He mastered it all—an incredible existence. [I'm] so happy and proud to be sharing this love for him with millions of other people.  David Bowie was one of the few true rocks stars of what now seems like a halcyon age. No matter what Bowie did, it never seemed stale or contrived. His interests seemed to genuinely lie in art and expression, and not relevance for the sake of attention. He just did what interested him, and he, if anyone, was frankly himself. I admire him for keeping his health issues private, and his choice to bow out with grace. His death still seems very unreal. His career obviously speaks for itself, and his influence is extremely pervasive to this day. He both lived and died artistically, leaving a final album as a parting gift. One can only hope to live a life so stylized and brilliant, and I'm sure wherever Bowie is now, It's a more interesting place because of his presence.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvnygm/7-producers-reflect-on-david-bowies-influence-on-electronic-music,Noisey,Vice
539,539,19-05-16 17:10,2016,5,19,Matthew Yglesias,Seattle and Portland are showing how cities can grow without sprawl,"When a metropolitan area adds population, it typically does so in part by adding people to areas that are already developed (infill) and in part by expanding its geographic footprint (sprawl). With the Census Bureau out today with new information on population dynamics in America's cities, I was interested in which effect predominates and where. So I asked Jed Kolko, an economist with research expertise in housing and urban growth patterns, and he sent me this scatter plot of population growth versus change in density: The density concept used here is tract-weighted density rather than raw density. Usually you hear about raw density, which takes a metro area's total population and divides it by the total landmass. That's easy to calculate, but it leads to some funny results, like Greater Los Angeles being denser than Greater New York. Instead, this concept of tract-weighted density measures tends to be more accurate. It shows the density of the place where the typical resident of the metro area lives and tells us a lot more about the nature of the urban form. What we see here, with tract-weighted density, is that the two cities adding the most density are two very low-density metros in North Carolina. They're followed by the two major metropolitan areas of the Pacific Northwest — further evidence that Oregon and Washington have housing policy regimes that California and the Northeast should try to emulate. Conversely, we see the metros that are de-densifying at the most rapid clip tend to be experiencing low or negative population growth. These are typically places where the urban core is still hollowing out rather than adding people, while the suburban frontier continues to grow. Last but by no means least, with the state of Texas accounting for a huge share of America's overall population growth, it's interesting to look at the divergent fates of its metro areas — Austin and Dallas are sprawling, but San Antonio and Houston are getting denser.",https://www.vox.com/2016/5/19/11713668/growth-and-sprawl,,Vox

Last week, Ottawa's Liberal government issued an emergency order to stop construction of a residential area in Quebec in order to save the western chorus frog, an endangered frog species. This frog has been stirring up a lot of shit in Quebec's construction industry. Also known as Pseudacris Triseriata in scientific terms, the western chorus frog is so small it can fit on your index finger, it chirps rather than croaks, and lives underground for three seasons of the year. But the problem is that this frog's ideal habitat consists of flat damp land, or in other words, prime real estate. So when Symbiocité, a large residential development, planned to build 1,000 units over western chorus frog habitat in La Prairie, Que., just south of Montreal, environmentalists rushed to the defense of their tiny froggy friends. After the government's emergency order last week, this development was cut by 171 units, or two square kilometers, to protect the species. In a statement last week, Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna said that the federal government made this decision based on scientific knowledge. ""We firmly believe that economic development and the protection of biodiversity can, and must, go hand in hand,"" she said. This rare ban on construction was supported by the Species at Risk Act, making the western chorus frog the first species to be protected on private property, and one of the only species the federal government has protected under emergency circumstances. This is the not the first time that people have tried to protect the chorus frog. Since Symbiocité announced their plans for development in 2013, environmentalists have been fighting construction in court. Former environment ministers Leona Aglukkaq and Peter Kent declined previous requests for an emergency order, however McKenna revisited the issue back in December when she succeeded Kent's role. According to the federal government, 60 percent of western chorus frog habitat has been lost in La Prairie in the last quarter century and, at this rate, the tiny amphibian could be extinct by 2030.

544,544,18-09-18 00:00,2018,9,18,,"Visa, Mastercard reach $6.2 billion settlement over card-swipe fees","(Reuters) - Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc, and a number of U.S. banks on Tuesday agreed to pay $6.2 billion to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by merchants over the fees they pay when they accept card payments.  Visa and Mastercard previously reached a $7.25 billion settlement with the merchants in the case, but that deal was thrown out by a federal appeals court in 2016 and the U.S. Supreme Court last year refused to revive it.  The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers opted out.  The card issuers named in the class-action lawsuit include JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Bank of America.  The lawsuit, brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers and dating back more than a decade, accuses the credit card companies of violating federal antitrust laws by forcing merchants to pay swipe fees and prohibiting them from directing consumers toward other methods of payment.  In rejecting the earlier settlement, which was opposed by retailers including Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Walmart Inc, a federal appeals court  found that the accord was unfair because some retailers would receive little or no benefit.  The card companies have already paid $5.3 billion and will now pay an additional $900 million.  Mastercard will pay an additional $108 million from funds set aside in the second quarter, the company said reut.rs/2OA2V0i.  Visa’s share represents around $4.1 billion, which the company expects to pay using funds previously deposited with the court, and from a litigation escrow it set up on June 28.

Unlike Christmas songs—which are often corny, contain sleigh bell effects and remind you of your dysfunctional family dynamic—Halloween songs are just like normal songs but “spooky.” And if you’re a spooky artist anyway, you’re given extra license to wallow in your natural state, which allows for all sorts of weird goth shit (think: Marilyn Manson “This is Halloween,” David Lynch “Crazy Clown Time,” Glass Candy “Halloween,” Tyler, the Creator “Transylvania,” all the best ones.) What I’m trying to say is, Gerard Way has released a song called “Baby You’re a Haunted House” alongside a grainy lyric video of some skeletons playing guitar, and it’s exactly what you’d imagine—meaning it slaps. Sitting somewhere between Weezer and Wavves, this song is the sort of thing you’d find soundtracking a 2000s teen movie that culminates in a dramatic high school Halloween dance where everyone kisses and all their problems are ultimately resolved.  This will be the My Chemical Romance frontman's first solo track since releasing “Don’t Try” and “Pinkish” for Record Store Day 2016, which were originally meant to appear on his 2014 solo debut LP Hesitant Alien.

547,547,05-09-18 20:49,2018,9,5,Dara Lind,"The New York Times’s Trump-bashing op-ed from a senior Trump official, explained","Apparently President Donald Trump is right: There really is a “deep state” of top government officials conspiring to thwart his will. And now, one of them is taking to the pages of the New York Times to brag about it. On Wednesday afternoon, the Times published an op-ed by an anonymous author, described as a “senior official in the Trump administration.” In a note accompanying the op-ed, the Times says that the author’s “identity is known to us,” but that the person’s “job would be jeopardized” if their name were published. The anonymous “senior official” claims to be part of an informal network to protect America from its president: “Many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.” The op-ed comes on the heels of advance reports about Bob Woodward’s forthcoming book Fear, which is said to describe several occasions of Trump staffers thwarting the president. At one point, then-chief economic adviser Gary Cohn reportedly whisked a tariff proposal off Trump’s desk before Trump could see and approve it. But while active White House officials have denied Woodward’s account, the Times op-ed claims that Trump’s inner circle trusts the president even less than anyone has guessed. Interestingly, the official response from the White House doesn’t claim the op-ed is fiction (as Trump has with Woodward’s book and other unflattering accounts). Instead, they attack the Times for lack of scruple in publishing the piece, and call the author a coward who simply resents what Trump has done for the country: The White House just issued an official response to the NYT pic.twitter.com/v5NMeJ9SYT Ironically, the White House’s conclusion — that it would be more honorable for the author to name themselves and resign than to keep their perch and whine anonymously — is also the position taken by many of the Trump critics sharing the op-ed and speculating about its author. Because even if a lot of people are willing to believe that the anonymous official is telling the truth, there are a lot of other people out there who aren’t — and another anonymous report about Trump’s unfitness for office doesn’t do anything to solve the problem it’s identified. We don’t know, and that’s the point. Countless Twitter gumshoes have come up with theories about who wrote the op-ed based on close scrutiny of its language: use of particular phrases like “lodestar” (Vice President Mike Pence!) and “don’t get me wrong” (Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen!) This is a bad idea. We don’t know how many rounds of edits Times editors went through with the op-ed author, and anyone who’s been edited can tell you that after even a moderate edit the prose doesn’t necessarily read “like you.” So without wild textual speculation, here’s what we got. The term “senior official” is pretty elastic; the term “Trump administration” is even more so. It could refer to someone in the White House or at any of the executive-branch agencies. In theory, this article could be written by a career government employee at a federal agency — which would hew much closer to Trump’s own theory of the “deep state,” and blunt the implication that Trump’s own hand-picked appointees think he is “half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless.” That said, the piece’s author sounds like a traditional mainstream Republican. They write in favor of “free minds, free markets and free people” (a vaguely libertarian slogan, but one that wouldn’t be out of place in the halls of the Heritage Foundation), and list “deregulation, historic tax reform, (and) a more robust military” as accomplishments to be proud of. If you were inclined to read tea leaves, you could note that the examples the author gives appear to focus on foreign policy and national security. If you were inclined to read tea leaves even more closely, you could note that this paragraph certainly implies that the author is at least privy to the mindset of Cabinet officials themselves: Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over. Did the Times actually get a Cabinet official (or a top aide to one) to write an anonymous op-ed trashing the president? Or did they allow a lower-level “senior” official to write a piece that casually implied membership in a “we” of Cabinet officials and those who consult with them? Only Times editors (and the author) know — which brings us to the next question. So basically: Times reporters now must try to unearth the identity of an author that our colleagues in Opinion have sworn to protect with anonymity? https://t.co/wj2nKmDHz9 As leaky as the Trump administration is, this op-ed is the strongest case anyone has seen that even the people in the top levels of the White House — people who believe that a “Trumpist” agenda would be good for America — don’t trust Donald Trump, the man, to carry that agenda out. It’s great gossip. Guessing who wrote it will probably be a DC parlor game for years, or at least until the Times’s Maggie Haberman (or the Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey) dig up the name. But publications generally have a higher bar for publishing quotes from people who won’t put their names to their words than just “juicy gossip.” In particular, there has to be a good reason that the person refuses to be named — because a lot of people, up to and including the president himself, reflexively assume that any anonymous quote is made up maliciously. And while the White House is famously leaky — and a lot of people are leaking mean things about the president — few of them are willing to actually say these things in public. Lots of Trump officials quit, but none of them says they are quitting because the president is erratic and terrifying — even though many of them appear to believe he is. It can be hard to tell the staffers who are saying bad things about Trump because they believe them from the staffers who are doing so because they want to signal to reporters that they know it’s considered impolite at best to work for this president. Meanwhile, voters who believe that Trump is a brilliant strategist who knows exactly how to make America great again are free to disregard any of the anonymous quotes. In this case, it seems fairly obvious that the person who wrote the op-ed would be fired by the president if their identity were revealed. On the other hand, if the person who wrote the op-ed were willing to lose their job to tell the public the truth about Trump’s unreliability, it would make their case much more notable. The thesis of the op-ed is that America is running on a “two-track presidency” — there’s the track on which the government actually runs, independently of the president, and then there’s the track on which the president complains about it as if he’s watching his own government on TV. The op-ed author points to anti-Russian sanctions as an example of this. And it’s true that for all Trump’s rage-tweeting about (for example) the Department of Justice, he doesn’t appear to be doing anything to prevent federal attorneys from (for example) continuing to prosecute Republican members of Congress. But there are a couple of problems with the idea of the “two-track” presidency. One of them is that the line between “what Trump believes” and “what conservatives believe” is, frankly, a lot clearer to elite conservatives than it is to elite liberals. A lot of Trump critics are suspicious of the deregulatory agenda the Times’s op-ed author crows about because they worry about the rapacity of corrupt business owners. A lot of them are skeptical of a more muscular military because they don’t want a weapon that can be used by a president who thinks that “kill more people” is a preferred substitute for strategy. The op-ed author doesn’t mention immigration, but that is one area where Trump’s own desires are being put into policy on a frequent basis — it took eight months and multiple attempts to invent a travel ban that would satisfy Trump’s campaign promises, and at least one conservative in the White House reportedly resigned because she felt that refugee-policy decisions weren’t being made based on reality. And even when people are actively trying to protect America from Trump, that effort may not work. The “free market” op-ed author, whoever they are, hasn’t stopped Trump from enacting steel and aluminum tariffs with very little review, or engaging in an escalating trade war with China — or from nearly scuttling NAFTA renegotiation talks by insulting Canada off-the-record during an interview. The “deep state” can try to hammer out an agreement with representatives of Kim Jong Un about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but they can’t stop the president from agreeing, behind closed doors, to Kim’s request to formally declare an end to the Korean War. The Times op-ed writer seems convinced that they are doing more good by staying than they would by telling the truth, with name attached, and leaving. But that doesn’t mean that every reader, even without knowing who the author is, has to agree.",https://www.vox.com/2018/9/5/17824538/new-york-times-who-is-senior-official-trump-op-ed,,Vox
548,548,30-03-18 11:53,2018,3,30,Julia Belluz,Lead is linked to heart deaths in adults,"The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is a reminder that lead exposure remains a toxic, irreversible threat to children’s brains, even in otherwise wealthy countries. After the city switched to a new water supply to cut costs, thousands of children suffered from lead exposure and the mayor declared a state of emergency in 2015 over the disaster. New research published March 12 in The Lancet suggests the water crisis likely harmed adults too — in particular, their hearts. The study estimated that more than 400,000 — or 18 percent — of all deaths in the US every year can be linked to lead exposure from all sources. Some 250,000 of those deaths are from cardiovascular disease, while 185,000 were related to coronary artery disease. That’s about 10 times more than the current estimates of lead-related deaths — and it suggests, lead study author Bruce Lanphear of Simon Fraser University, said, “Lead exposure appears to be a major but largely ignored risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease — especially coronary heart disease.” “This is huge,” said Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician in Flint whose research helped expose the water crisis there. “It’s time our policies and practices caught up with the science, and we truly invested in lead elimination not only for our children today but also for decades to come.” The participants in the study, who were adults in the late 1980s, were exposed to lead through sources like paint, gasoline, water, or soil, potentially starting in childhood and lasting throughout their lives. And there was a strong association between people with higher blood levels of lead and a higher risk of death, especially from cardiovascular complications. While smoking, a lack of exercise, and an unhealthy diet are certainly important contributors to cardiovascular disease, health researchers are now warning that lead exposure needs to be considered too. “These findings throw one important risk factor into the mix [for cardiovascular problems], which has largely been overlooked until now,” said Philip J. Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who wrote the study’s related commentary. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in mineral deposits in the Earth’s crust. It’s also a poisonous substance for humans, accumulating in our teeth and bones. At higher levels, lead can register in blood tests. People are typically exposed to lead by breathing in lead-contaminated dust, drinking water from leaded pipes, or eating from cans that have been soldered with lead. For children, there are other risks: eating soil, or paint chips, for example. “Children’s innate curiosity and their age-appropriate hand-to-mouth behavior result in their mouthing and swallowing lead-containing or lead-coated objects,” the World Health Organization summed up. Inside the body, lead can slip into human cells easily and wreak havoc. In children, particularly under the age of 10 or babies in the womb, the metal can pass through the blood-brain barrier and kill off brain cells. Children absorb up to five times as much lead as adults, and with their smaller bodies and developing nervous systems, it doesn’t take much to sicken them. “That is why children who have been exposed to lead in early life have loss of IQ or shortening of attention span or other cognitive or mental health problems,” Landrigan explained. There’s also no real cure for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy can reduce the amount of lead circulating in the bloodstream — but this hasn’t been proven to improve children’s intellectual abilities or behaviors after lead damage has been done. Since the 1970s, lead exposure has been declining worldwide after the metal was eliminated from paint and gasoline in the wake of research exposing its health effects. Researchers have also known that lead can enter blood vessels in both adults and children, harming the endothelial cells that line the vessels. This process hardens arteries and causes plaque to form in blood vessels, increasing blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Meanwhile, lead can damage kidneys, which play an important role in regulating blood pressure — also increasing a person’s risk of heart disease and stroke, Landrigran explained. This is why the Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization, and the National Toxicology Program out of the National Institutes of Health have all determined that high levels of lead exposure increase the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, Lanphear said. But lead’s potential harms to adults and their hearts have gotten relatively little attention among the public and policymakers. Lanphear and his co-authors hope to change that. For the study, the researchers gathered data on a nationally representative sample of 14,000 adults who were enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1988 and 1994, and followed up until December 31, 2011. The study participants had undergone a slew of medical tests, including quantifying the lead levels in their blood. Their health data was also linked up with records about their cause of death, when relevant. Lead in the blood is typically measured in µg/dL (micrograms per deciliter) or in parts per billion. Researchers used to think 5 µg/dL — or 50 parts per billion, about the same concentration as 100 tablespoons in an Olympic swimming pool — was a safe blood lead level. But agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently determined there’s actually no known safe blood concentration for children. Lanphear and his colleagues believe the same may be true for adults. In the study, they found a strong correlation between lead in the blood and a higher risk of death from cardiovascular complications: Comparing the group with the lowest level of lead exposure (1 µg/dL or 10 parts per billion) to the group with the highest (6.7 µg/dL or 67 parts per billion), the researchers found a 70 percent increase in cardiovascular disease mortality risk and a doubling of mortality from coronary heart disease. This indicates that more lead exposure may lead to more heart trouble, and also that there is no safe threshold for lead exposure. Even after the researchers controlled for potential confounding factors — including age, sex, ethnic origin, where people lived, smoking status, diabetes, alcohol intake, and even household income — the association held. Still, this was an observational study, which can only tell us about relationships between phenomena, and not whether one caused the other. And at least one important potential confounding factor was overlooked, said Stephen Lim, director of science at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which measures health effects of lead exposure on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease globally. Lead is correlated with other known risk factors for cardiovascular disease — most importantly, that lead exposure tends to be higher in lower-income communities like Flint, Lim said. “[They] did not control for community-level socioeconomic factors, and as a result, the magnitude of the effect found in the study may be confounded by the relationship of higher lead exposure in lower socioeconomic communities.” And it’s possible this might have exaggerated the magnitude of lead’s effects on heart health. “That lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease is not surprising, [but] what is surprising is the magnitude of the effect,” Lim said. “Today, lead exposure is much lower because of regulations banning the use of lead in petrol, paints, and other consumer products, so the number of deaths from lead exposure will be lower in younger generations,” Lanphear said. Landrigan suggested that blood lead testing should become the norm in adult medicine the way pediatricians now often screen children for lead exposure. Flint’s Hanna-Attisha said the study should be further fuel for policymakers working to eliminate lead exposures from our environment. “We spend billions each year treating cardiovascular disease — medications, hospitalizations, procedures — yet with lead elimination, we know how to prevent a portion of this health burden, not even considering preventing all the other evils of lead exposure,” she said. There are many ways the EPA and federal regulators can continue to reduce people’s lead exposure, Lanphear said, by enforcing stricter standards on allowable levels of lead in the air, water, dust, and soil. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has declared a “war on lead” in drinking water in the wake of the Flint water crisis, but the agency has dragged its feet on new regulations for lead in paint. “Ongoing sources... need to be phased out, remediated, or banned,” Lanphear said, adding that manufacturers should further reduce lead levels in foods, drinks, and cosmetics. With limited treatments available for lead, he emphasized, “the ideal solution is prevention.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/15/17107924/lead-health-adults-heart-problems,,Vox

In the first of his five corruption trials, Lula, who served as president from 2003 to 2011, was found guilty of accepting thousands of dollars in bribes from an engineering firm that paid for the former president’s refurbished apartment in exchange for lucrative contracts with state-owned oil giant Petrobras. His trial is among the hundreds of graft cases that comprise the enormous corruption scandal known as Operation Car Wash that has engulfed the highest echelons of Brazilian politics for the better part of three years. Current President Michel Temer and former house speaker Eduardo Cunha are also among the hundreds of political and business elites embroiled in the controversy. But being swarmed by corruption allegations for more than a year hasn’t affected Lula’s popularity. Despite his many scandals, he remains one of Brazil’s most popular politicians and is among the favorites to win the presidency in 2018. A poll published by Brazilian polling company Datafolha on June 26 showed that regardless of who Lula was put up against, he’d receive about 30 percent of the first-round vote — a healthy lead over his opponents. Another poll commissioned by pollster MDA showed that Lula would crush Temer in a head-to-head, winning 42.9 percent of the vote to Temer’s 19 percent. (Temer has been a historically unpopular president from the start, with his approval rating sinking to a mere 9 percent in April.) Lula is credited with reviving Brazil’s economy during his presidency and creating popular social welfare programs like the “Bolsa Familia” cash-grant program for families and aid to farmers. Such programs lifted many of the country’s marginalized populations out of poverty and earned Lula an enduring and loyal base, said Dr. Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American Studies program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

Today in the red chair is Chris Urmson, the CEO of Aurora. Chris was previously the CTO of self-driving cars at Google, and he co-founded Aurora last year along with Sterling Anderson and Drew Bagnell who ran their own self-driving projects at Tesla and Uber. Chris, welcome to the show. Chris Urmson: Thanks for having me here. No problem. I’m so excited to talk about something good about cars, not Uber ... I was joking with you then. I’m so tired of these people. In any case, I’m not tired of you, you’re fantastic. So just by way of background, Chris and I met when ... explain, you showed me the first really autonomous car essentially that Google had in a parking lot near Google. Yeah, I think we had you out in one of the Priuses way back in the early days. Well, the early days, right. That was when they were ... those were outfitted cars that we drove around the area, the Google campus area. That’s right. I think we’d go buy them off the dealership and then we put lasers and radars and cameras on them, add our software to them and go and test them out on the roads. Right exactly. But after that, it was the little clown car. Remember we did the clown car thing and I tried to have it run you over but it wouldn’t do it. No, it was good. You know, I think about the koala car rather than clown car, but ... Okay, what do we call it? Koala car. Koala car. All right, okay, I can call it clown car, but explain that. We showed it off at the Code Conference a couple years ago for the first time. But I came out there and Liz Gannes and I got in it. Explain that car, because that was different from the others we had done. Yeah, so that was a car that we built from the ground up at Google, and the goal behind it was one, to learn what it meant to integrate the software and sensors into a car, and then the other was to have the first shot at having a car that was designed to be a self-driving car. And you know, what do you want that vehicle to look like so it can be a good avatar for the technology in the community and what experience do you want people to have in it. What was fascinating was just how much extra space there was and how ... Right. There’s no wheel, no driving wheel, no pedals, no nothing, right? Really just a screen. That’s right. You just tell it where you want to go and it takes you there. So you get to think differently about the interior of the car, you have to think differently about what people want to do in the car and that was part of the exercise in developing the vehicle. Yeah, we’ll get more into that concept at the time, but it was really cool. It was sort of like being in a Disney ride or something like that. That’s what it felt like because it was small and adorable and stuff like that. Yeah that’s the kind of thing we were shooting for, right? We wanted your experience in the first time you’re in a truly self-driving car to be not scary, to be friendly, to be fun. Right. But you kept it in a parking lot, correct? Because you were testing it, you didn’t want it out in the wild, essentially. It wasn’t ready yet for us to let it loose on the roads. Right, right. All right, we’ll talk about that more going forward, but let’s go to your background. Now, talk about ... we’re going to get to what Aurora is, but how did you get into self-driving cars? You were there super early and now everyone seems to be a self-driving car engineer. Yeah. I guess I started working on robots in ’98 when I went to Carnegie Mellon to do my PhD. Did you do that before when you were in high school? Were you a big robotics person? No. I built little robot things out of Lego and had fun with that and at some point while I was doing my undergraduate degree I saw a poster for this robot crawling out of a volcano and I said, “That looks really cool. That would be fun to go do.” You wanted to build a robot crawling out of a volcano? Or just the concept. Just the idea that you could ... there’s something really appealing about technology that you can touch. With robots, everyone’s seen them in the movies — whether it’s R2D2 and C3PO or what have you — but they don’t really exist. And so the chance to go and work on that, and this was a place that was doing it that seemed really exciting. I went there and I spent a number of years working on NASA projects. Just before the grand challenge, which were these big robot races out in the desert, I was part of a project that was testing a robot down in the Atacama Desert in Chile. So we had this little four-wheeled robot, it was called Hyperion. It was really ... it was a cute robot and it would move around at 15 cm a second to 30 cm a second which is like a slow walk to a slightly less slow walk kind of speed. And we’re out in the middle of the desert testing this thing and there’s a dozen engineers and most of the time it didn’t work. We were experimenting, playing with it and fixing it, and that was when this DARPA challenge got announced. The idea was to build a robot that could drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas across the desert. Which isn’t very hard because it’s straight, right? The desert, it’s ... Well, it was pretty hard. No, so no, I get that, but they did a challenge that was relative to something that was manageable, correct? Well, they called it a grand challenge ... I know it’s hard, you smart people, but you know what I’m talking about. Well honestly at the time it wasn’t obvious that it was doable, right? Nobody had done it before and in fact, people thought that it was not solvable, at least in the year and a half or year or whatever it was that we had. And it turns out they were right. We had a bunch of graduate students and undergraduates and we took a Humvee and tore it apart and put lasers and radars and stuff on it. So robot car, not a robot driving a car. A robot car. Right, right, okay. Because that’s creepy, a robot driving a car. It could be pretty cute. Have you seen the little Asimo robots? No I’m thinking Terminator, but go ahead. Yeah, that would be creepy, yeah. So we got this thing, we got it out to the desert, we tested it a bunch. Turns out 10 days before the race we rolled over during testing so that was disappointing. Wow, did you roll it over? Or did it roll itself over? It rolled itself over. This was ... we wanted to do a 150-mile test and we were going to do it at 30 mph and take five hours. We said, “Well, why don’t we do it at 50 mph because that would take three hours. That seems better than taking five hours."" That was a bad decision. Too fast. Yeah, a little too fast. It ended up getting off the road and rolling. We got it put back together, we took it to the competition. It was kind of like robot Woodstock, right? There was all kinds of different things there, from something inspired by centipedes to little ATVs to our big Humvee and everything in between. Most of them didn’t work that well, ours ended up working the best. We got it out to the race course, set off in the morning and it was just magnificent, right? We’d been working on this for a year and a half and this was kind of the first time we let it loose in the desert. Was someone in the car? No. It was completely by itself. Somebody from the government was chasing it in a pickup truck and they had just one button that could basically kill. Blow it up? No, no ... There was some rumor that they had people that were out in case one of them went crazy, but no, they just had a little remote e-stop for it. And so this thing, you know, we’re stood off to the side and off it goes charging into the desert and it had this giant fin on the top for no real good reason. It looked cool and that was all you could see as it went into the sagebrush. So it charges off into the desert and that was all we knew until a little later in the day, seven and a half miles into the 150-mile course, basically it burst into flames. Oh, all right. That’s an issue. It got off the side of the road and high-centered. It was trying really hard to move forward, it didn’t realize it was stuck so it spun the wheels harder and harder and the tires melted and big clouds of smoke. Oh. Did anybody win? No, not that year. We went the furthest. We drove through, I don’t know, three fence posts on the way. The guys who went behind us had a much smaller vehicle and so it was really good for them that we took the fence posts out because they were riding our tire tracks and would’ve driven right into the fence posts and probably not broken them. So this was the end of the first challenge. This is how great inventions are made. Right. A lot failure, right? So have you been interested in this as a kid? Or were you just going to go into regular computing? I didn’t know what I wanted to do. When I went to college, up until the last minute I was debating between going into medicine and engineering. At some point, I realized I really didn’t like the sight of blood and that seemed kind of gross. And then I was like, “Hm, maybe I should do engineering.” And you like the sight of metals, so you’re fine with that. It’s okay with metal, it’s not ... But have you thought about ... robotics was not ... just a regular computing career, correct? Engineering. Yeah, I went into computer engineering. It seemed like the thing to do. At the time, Nortel Networks was a big thing in Canada and it was hiring and it seemed like that could be fun. And then, like I said, this poster just caught my attention and I was like, “That’s cool.” So a lot of people do start in robotics. They do start before they’re doing this. What moved you into cars, because you did this car because you did this — it was just that DARPA had this challenge — that entranced you. It just seemed really cool. Right? The idea that you could actually have a robot do something meaningful. There had been ... robotics had made it into manufacturing and obviously there were space exploration robots, but there wasn’t really robots in people’s everyday life and there wasn’t a way they could have an impact. I wouldn’t claim that at the time could see the future and see what’s transpiring now in the industry, but at the time it was very much, this is a way to help the military, right, and get young men and women out of harm’s way, particularly moving supplies to the front line, which is a big part of their job. Yeah, so that’s what you were thinking. Had you thought about other robotic uses in the home, of the actual servants or those kind of things, or not? Driving got you because why? Because it, again, it just poignantly seemed cool and that’s really all the backstory right there. Having spent time walking very slowly behind a robot in the desert in Chile, the idea that you could have a robot instead of moving at walking speed, move faster than I could run and drive through a desert, that just was mesmerizing. This was a nascent area of doing this, of doing automated cars, essentially. Although in science fiction it’s certainly, that’s all there is. That’s how people have imagined it and things like that. How did you stay in the area? So you started doing it at Carnegie Mellon and then what? Yeah. So there was that first challenge where no one won. The second challenge happened and a number of vehicles actually finished and this was a year later. There was a third challenge, which this time was at an air base and it was driving on roads and it was much closer to what we’re doing today. No pedestrians, no cyclists, no traffic lights, but the basics of it and that was in 2007. That was the last of the DARPA challenges. It was exciting and fun, that one, the team I was tech for ended up winning. And what did you do in that one, in the third one? So the third one, it was 60 miles driving around on roads. 60 mph. No, 60 miles of distance. It ended up ... it was probably between 30 and 40 mph, that sort of thing. It had to deal with other traffic. So the ones across the desert, they made sure that nothing was moving near the vehicles. This last one, the urban challenge, they had stunt drivers out there bringing traffic into it and following the vehicles around and the vehicles themselves had to interact with one another, so if two of them came to a four-way intersection with stop signs, they had to stop and take turns and if you squinted, you could kind of see the future, right? This was very cool. And then DARPA basically said ... Any big mishaps during ... No huge mishaps, there was some entertaining things. One of the vehicles literally drove into a building. Oh fun. Yeah. It was a big truck, it was one of these big military trucks and it drove into the building. And they had given you the trucks they wanted you to ... No, everybody got to bring their own. There was another one where a car didn’t see one of these foldover gates and drove into it and basically the gate decapitated these Velodyne lasers, you know the spinning Kentucky Fried Chicken things. Right, it just drove into it and off the things flew. Gone it went, which makes them get around, essentially. Yeah, that was kind of the end of that for them. Then the cars from Cornell and MIT were in the competition. They both did incredibly well but they had the first robot-robot crash on course. So, that was ... Did they crash into each other? One wouldn’t give way for the other? They were both moving at about three miles per hour and it was kind of like a super-slow-speed train wreck. So they were like, “Nooooooo.” “Nooooo.” It was very Austin Powers. Yeah. But then, you know, three, five, six vehicles finished that challenge. So when you were doing these ... These are all fun. I mean, I’ve seen, I’ve been to some of these events: Is it how things get created? Is these challenges and people try to do the contest ... there’s bunches of space contests, all kind of different things. So you were doing this at Carnegie Mellon, how did you get to Google? This was what year you were doing these? So this wound up in 2007, basically 10 years ago almost, yeah. It was quite early. I spent a couple years still at the university. I worked with Caterpillar and there we were moving, automating these big house-sized dump trucks, which was ... imagine 400 tons with nobody in it moving 40 mph. Yeah, I would imagine that would be scary. Cool and scary, but yeah. So spent some time on that and then I ... Sebastian Thrun and I had been talking about doing something together. We had been competing against one another in the challenges and thought it would be great to work together and we had a lot of respect for one another. The teams we had led finished one and two. He was where? He was at Stanford at the time. And then he had just sold View Tool to Google, which is what became Street View over time. So he was now mostly at Google and partly at Stanford. So we were talking about starting something, and at some point it came out that the right thing to do was actually just do it at Google. So in the beginning of 2009, I went on leave for my faculty position at Carnegie Mellon and moved my family, we moved out here. My wife was incredibly understanding; we had all our network of friends and relationships in Pittsburgh and things were feeling pretty good. It was this risk to move out to crazy California where everyone wears Birkenstocks and, you know, whatever. In retrospect, best decision we ever made. Sure. So you came ... and what was the promise? Did you meet with ... who was most interested, Larry or Sergey? Both of them have been long interested in that. Yeah. I think both of them have been long interested in it. When I came out, I chatted with Sebastian, chatted with some of the early team members and then we decided, “Yeah, let’s do this.” But where does the impetus come at Google, from the top? They wanted to do ... what was the idea at the beginning? So the idea at the very beginning was to find out if this could actually be done and it really did come from the top. I credit Larry and Sergey for having the vision to go and try this before anyone else, right? In 2009. When we started talking about this 2010, it was kind of a joke, right? “Google’s doing self-driving cars, that’s such ...” Effectively, “Why are they wasting money on this? That’s never going to work.” But they saw this back in 2009, right? And they said it really came from a place of they have amazing technology, they have an incredible ability to harness engineering talent, and transportation is such an important problem to work on. They had been working on a lot of different things, Fiber, all kinds of different schemes and stuff like that. They had some barge in San Francisco Bay that they were working on. This is an area of great interest to them, for some reason, I’m not sure why particularly. But they were the first, they were the first of the companies that set off the interest in it. At Carnegie Mellon, you were doing it mostly theoretically, correct? That the idea that who would ... except for Caterpillar, I’m thinking, or the military. Yeah, the military, Caterpillar, we had sponsorship from General Motors. They had set up a research lab. Volkswagen had a lab out here with Stanford. So but it was still in the, “Hey, this is 20 to 30 years out” kind of mindset, not the committed, concentrated effort that we saw at Google. So what were you trying to do there initially at Google when you were starting? So the goal initially was just to show, prove to ourselves that this could actually become a technology that works. So we had basically two milestones. One was to drive 100,000 miles on public roads, which was ten times more than anyone had done before. And then the other was to drive a 1,000 miles of really interesting roads. What’s an interesting road? So driving down the Pacific Coast Highway between San Francisco effectively and LA, or driving all the Bay bridges and dealing with all of the interchanges. And if you remember when 92 and 680 was all dug up, so we’re driving through that at the time, or driving through the Presidio where there’s these windy roads and in fact, this one place where there’s a road that’s only one lane wide but traffic goes both directions on it. We drove Lombard Street. Oh, the crookedest street in the world. And those goals were because just to show ... to have hype around it or have proof that you could do these things? The two goals were slightly different. The 100,000 miles goal was really to kind of get statistical data, right. To say, we’re not just kind of driving anything once. This is an interesting data set we can learn something from. Right, to teach the cars, that’s what you’re trying to do, presumably. To teach and understand, teach the engineering team, too. It wasn’t just data gathering, it was like, “Oh I never really thought about how retro-reflective signs are or how difficult it is to understand the behavior of an articulated truck.” And then the 1,000 miles ... But humans do by themselves, for the most part, successfully. Yeah. It’s very humbling as somebody working in this space, how easy some of these tasks are for people to do and how hard they are to actually get software and technology to solve. So you were doing that there and you created both cars that were outfitted? Like those Priuses you talked about and then the car itself, the koala car. Thank you. No problem, it looks like a clown. But talk about why the different efforts, because one is semi-autonomous, correct? No, they were all on the path to being fully automated. Yeah. Why go in those two directions at Google at the time? Which everyone followed, really. First, it was expedient. So when we started with the Priuses we were trying to understand whether this was even interesting or viable and so we wanted to get on the road as quickly as we could, safely of course but quickly. So, that meant using a vehicle. We then moved to the Lexus and it was the same thing, we were augmenting the Lexuses with our sensors and getting them out on the road, but again it was towards fully self-driving vehicles. When we started the koala car, that was to now starting thinking more about what this looks like as a product. So we’ve spent a lot of time learning about the technology and we’re getting closer to having it ready to deploy. What’s the first vehicle we’d like where somebody might see it on the road with nobody behind the wheel? How do we, as we start to think about partnerships with car companies, how do we become a better educated partner so that as we work with them and they say something about the flux capacitor, we have some inclination about what a flux capacitor is, right? Yeah. You’re making a reference from a movie. Anyway when we get back with Chris Urmson, we’re going to talk more about what are the challenges they faced at Google and why he started his startup Aurora. [ad] We’re here with Chris Urmson, who was the first CTO of the Google car effort and now has his own self-driving car startup, Aurora. So you were at Google doing these things trying essentially to proof of concept, would that be the right way to put it? Or really wanted to make products. You, I know, wanted to make a car on the road, correct? Yeah. The company really wants to make a product. I believe that deeply. There’s very little value in working on technology if you don’t get it out there and get it helping people. Right. What was the path to do that? Because everyone suddenly jumped in from Apple, Tesla, everybody else was jumping in, Uber and others. Talk about that environment when suddenly everybody gets excited about something that you were one of the few companies doing. Yeah, I think on the one hand, you’d like to be able to be the one company doing this and pushing it forward, and on the other, it’s awesome. Because you know a — what is it? — a rising sea floats all boats. And so if you think about the social values of the increased safety on the road, the better access to mobility for people, we want to see this happen, right? I think it’s really important for society, and so as more companies get involved, there’s a broader ecosystem, there’s more likelihood that one of them succeeds. So I think that’s fantastic, right? That’s very desirable. Right, and so everybody rushed in, including creating companies. Why did you leave Google? What was the ... what happened? So at the end of the day, I just ... I wasn’t having as much fun, right? And we had a tremendous team and it’s an amazing company. I owed it to the team and I owed it to the company that I was at my best. It just didn’t seem like that was where I was, and you know they had tremendous leaders there, Dmitri Dolgov is a very close friend of mine and he’s just fantastic. He’s stepped up and leading the technology development; with John coming in they have an experienced automotive person there. It seemed like a good time to step aside, and honestly, when I left, I didn’t know what I was going to do. It wasn’t like, “I’m out of here. I’m going to go make a self-driving car company.” It was ... What did you want to do different that you couldn’t do with the giant sums of money Google throws at people at all times of day? I just didn’t know what I wanted to do. I talked to a couple companies, actually. This is hard to say, I was talking to a couple of different companies that were working on flying cars. Flying cars, okay. Blows my mind that I can say that today. All owned by Larry Page, anyway, go ahead. I know he has one of them. They were in fact ... I talked to a number of car companies. I talked to ... I was just genuinely, “Hey, I’ve spent the last decade-plus working on this.” “I know a thing or two about self-driving cars,” just when everybody is suddenly very interested in it. Well, that was part of ... you know like certainly people ... it was very flattering, right? When I left there was a lot of interest in talking to me about it, but I was not convinced that this was the next thing I should be doing, right? It was an amazing ride at Google and it was time to like, “Okay, let’s see what else is out there.” Were you worried they weren’t going to make a car, like actually produce a car, or ... No, I don’t think that’s necessarily the right path, for Google to make a car. I think Google is very good at the technology side of this, the self-driving technology ... So as they did in phones. They didn’t make the phones, they made .... Right, well, that was recently. But no, I think they were very good at the self-driving technology, and there’s people who are very good at making cars and it seems clear that the right path is to marry those up or marry a few of them together. From what I can tell from the outside at this point, it seems like they’re making progress for that. Seems like Fiat Chrysler and them are working well together. I read something in the press about Honda potentially or not, it’s hard to say. Let’s talk a little — quickly, before we talk about your startup — about the big car companies in this, very slow to it initially but now GM bought up Cruise, everybody’s trying to get a piece of it. Talk about their roles, because they’re the obvious ... At one point I had one car person saying, “Oh it’s trivial to build a car.” I was like, “No, it’s not. No, it’s not.” Yeah, you’re shaking your head. And I was sort of ... that’s so arrogant of Silicon Valley. I mean, obviously the software is incredibly difficult, but car building is incredibly hard at the same time. And yet they’ve been pretty slow. Why is that, from your perspective? So I think it’s really important to understand the context, right? And I think the biggest thing that’s lacking — honestly, on both sides — is mutual respect. Because I think it’s very easy for Silicon Valley to look at the car companies and say, “Oh my goodness, they’re so slow.” “We’re going to disrupt them.” They’re going to disrupt them, right? And then it’s very easy for the car companies to say, “Oh my goodness, look at those Silicon Valley guys, they’re so seat-of-their-pants,” right? “How can they actually ever do anything big and complicated?” Obviously both of those statements are completely false. What you have when you look at the car companies, you have to realize they’ve been at this for 100 years, they work in this incredibly regulated industry and they kind of make a miracle happen like every two minutes. They basically put a car on the road that’s going to work for the next 15 years, that’s got explosions going off inside it, right, and it just works. You’re safe, right? If you get in a car crash, more likely than not ... Most cars you’re safe in, yeah. No, they’re very safe comparatively. Comparatively. Certainly in the U.S. right? You’re going to do pretty well. So there’s so much constraints on their ecosystem that they’ve developed management processes and they’ve developed business processes that allow them to execute within those constraints. It takes two billion dollars to make a new car. If you could imagine, if to launch any web app you had to spend two billion dollars, the process that we put in place and the way we’d invest in them would be very different. And so my view is that, the key is to get ... find a way to have a trusting and respectful relationship on both sides, where because of all of those great processes they have in place to allow them to ship cars, they’re not particularly good at kind of innovative software development, right? Those processes are great for the engineering cycles they need, but they’re not really compatible with the top-flight Silicon Valley software engineers. So this is where we thought that Aurora could maybe fit, is that we do have people who understand — you know, not nearly with the depth that the folks in the automotive space have — but respect how complicated what they do is and at the same time we actually pretty deeply understand the complexity of developing the self-driving car systems and how to do that and how to motivate the team and how to build the team that needs to do that. So that’s the goal for Aurora, is to get self-driving cars on the road as quickly as possible and do that safely and thoughtfully and do it through partnership with the folks that can help us. Right, which is the carmakers. It’s carmakers, it’s a broader ecosystem than that. What meaning? Meaning that, transportation as a service — you know, whether it be Uber, Lyft or Didi, right? That’s going to be an important part of how this technology comes to market. The car company ... you have to have a car to have a self-driving car. There’s folks who actually ... so I think I understand a little bit about lasers, a little bit about radar, can probably contribute to the design of those, but I don’t really know how to make it so that it can submerge in a salt bath and drive on your car for the next 15 years. So there’s a whole collection of tier-one automotive suppliers who know how to do that part really well. And it would be silly for me to try and do that or for even our team even to do that. Right, but it requires the coordination of a lot of people and that I think is why it’s so difficult. Absolutely. What’s interesting is that carmakers themselves, though seen as slow, it’s sort of eating into their current business. I mean, every time they can ship a Ford 150 or whatever, the trucks and things like that, there’s that. Like who’s thinking of it at these car companies? They’re looking at companies like Uber, Didi and Lyft and they’re seeing that something is happening. Meaning nobody wants to drive. Well, not just nobody wants to drive, but there’s an immense amount of value — at least on paper being credited. And if you look at, say, the market cap of Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, the U.S. big three, and you look at the market cap of Uber, Didi and Lyft, they’re basically the same. I think it may actually be ... And Tesla is all of them together or something like that. Well, I don’t know about all of them together, but it’s bigger than one or two of the U.S. guys. I think that the market cap of the ride-sharing companies is probably going to double in the next few years. Why is that, given that ... they sell millions of cars and make lots of money, this group doesn’t? I think that part of it is the opportunity to capture kind of the usage of the car in a way that they can’t do as a car company. So when you buy a car, you know you probably use it ... I don’t know if you own a car or not. Yeah, I do. You probably use it an hour, maybe two hours a day at most. If you’re in the ride-sharing business and you operate it effectively, you might be operating that car 16, 18 hours a day. And so you get much higher utilization so there’s much higher value you create out of that vehicle. So the carmakers, the danger they had ... they have been worried about is becoming the dumb pipes, essentially, the way the cable operators were. Yeah and often the metaphor they use is they don’t want to be the handset provider, actually. And part of that is because what they do is complicated and valuable and so they don’t want that to be devalued. So how do they stop being that way? Well, they’re trying. You see almost all of them at this",,,
552,552,28-03-17 21:45,2017,3,28,Jacob Gardenswartz,Read President Trump’s executive order on climate change,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back a number of policies put in place by the Obama administration to combat climate change. As Vox’s Brad Plumer explained in detail, the order includes these key instructions to the federal government: Still, experts agree that dismantling Obama’s climate policies will be much trickier than simply signing this document. Tuesday’s order is just the first step in what is sure to be a years-long process. The full text of the executive order, titled “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,” is available here, or you can read it below. PROMOTING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. (a) It is in the national interest to promote clean and safe development of our Nation's vast energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation. Moreover, the prudent development of these natural resources is essential to ensuring the Nation's geopolitical security. (b) It is further in the national interest to ensure that the Nation's electricity is affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean, and that it can be produced from coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources. (c) Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that executive departments and agencies (agencies) immediately review existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the development of domestic energy resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. (d) It further is the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law, all agencies should take appropriate actions to promote clean air and clean water for the American people, while also respecting the proper roles of the Congress and the States concerning these matters in our constitutional republic. (e) It is also the policy of the United States that necessary and appropriate environmental regulations comply with the law, are of greater benefit than cost, when permissible, achieve environmental improvements for the American people, and are developed through transparent processes that employ the best available peer-reviewed science and economics. Sec. 2. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Safe, Efficient Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources, with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy resources. Such review shall not include agency actions that are mandated by law, necessary for the public interest, and consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. (b) For purposes of this order, ""burden"" means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, or otherwise impose significant costs on the siting, permitting, production, utilization, transmission, or delivery of energy resources. (c) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency with agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall develop and submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a plan to carry out the review required by subsection (a) of this section. The plans shall also be sent to the Vice President, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the OMB Director a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the OMB Director that such agency does have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. (d) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall submit a draft final report detailing the agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section to the Vice President, the OMB Director, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality. The report shall include specific recommendations that, to the extent permitted by law, could alleviate or eliminate aspects of agency actions that burden domestic energy production. (e) The report shall be finalized within 180 days of the date of this order, unless the OMB Director, in consultation with the other officials who receive the draft final reports, extends that deadline. (f) The OMB Director, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall be responsible for coordinating the recommended actions included in the agency final reports within the Executive Office of the President. (g) With respect to any agency action for which specific recommendations are made in a final report pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the head of the relevant agency shall, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding, those actions, as appropriate and consistent with law. Agencies shall endeavor to coordinate such regulatory reforms with their activities undertaken in compliance with Executive Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs). Sec. 3. Rescission of Certain Energy and Climate-Related Presidential and Regulatory Actions. (a) The following Presidential actions are hereby revoked: (i) Executive Order 13653 of November 1, 2013 (Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change); (ii) The Presidential Memorandum of June 25, 2013 (Power Sector Carbon Pollution Standards); (iii) The Presidential Memorandum of November 3, 2015 (Mitigating Impacts on Natural Resources from Development and Encouraging Related Private Investment); and (iv) The Presidential Memorandum of September 21, 2016 (Climate Change and National Security).

In January of this year, Wynn resigned from the committee after dozens of women accused him of sexual assault and abuse. On Monday of this week, Cohen’s home, office, and hotel room were raided by FBI agents investigating his role in making hush money payments to two women on behalf of Donald Trump. And Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen helped make another payment: $1.6 million to a former Playboy playmate reportedly impregnated by Cohen’s RNC committee colleague Elliott Broidy. Broidy has reportedly resigned from the RNC. According to the Journal, in the settlement agreement, Cohen even used the same pseudonyms for Broidy and the former Playboy model as he used in the nondisclosure agreement between Trump and porn actress Stormy Daniels: David Dennison and Peggy Peterson. Cohen is still a member of the RNC finance committee as of today. And the RNC (and a Trump 2020 Super PAC) have refused to return Wynn’s donations.",https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17234930/michael-cohen-rnc-trump-scandal,,Vox
554,554,24-01-17 16:54,2017,1,24,Lara O'Reilly,Ad agencies paying settlements in order to not reveal contracts and MSAs,"Some US ad agencies are making secret settlements to clients to avoid being fully audited by them, sources tell Business Insider.The payments come after the industry was accused of keeping millions in media rebates that should have gone to clients.The settlement sums are in the millions of dollars and have taken the form of cash or significant fee reductions.Multiple agencies have denied involvement. Media-buying agencies in the US are paying their clients secret multi-million dollar settlements rather than show them all of their contracts and service agreements with media owners. Multiple sources with knowledge of the matter suggested there have been at least 20 cases where either a settlement has been paid or where there are ongoing negotiations about a settlement payment. The settlement amounts have ranged from the low single-digit millions of dollars to more than $10 million — but below the materiality threshold at which agency holding companies would have to disclose them in their annual reports. Some of these settlements have been in cash, while some have taken the form of an agreement to significantly discount the client's fees the following year. This practice is not pervasive across the US ad-buying industry, but multiple, competitive agency groups have been drawing up settlement agreements Settlements have been paid out by a range of media-buying agencies and have not been isolated to a specific holding company. That isn't to say that the practice is pervasive across the industry — and not every holding company has been involved, according to our sources — but rather that settlements agreements have been by different, unrelated, competitor advertising groups. Both parties — the marketer and the agency — usually sign NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) as part of the terms of the settlement, preventing either company from revealing publicly it took place. The sources asked we did not reveal the names of the agencies and clients involved, due to these NDAs. This new type of settlement payout appears to be a direct response to the release of the high-profile Association of National Advertisers (ANA) report into media-buying practices in the US last summer. The report claimed rebates and other non-transparent business practices were ""pervasive"" in the US media ad buying ecosystem. The major advertising agency holding groups denied wrongdoing and criticized the methodology of the report shortly after it was released, arguing that the anonymous nature of the interviews conducted and the fact that it named no individual bad actors or agencies had the potential to damage the reputation of the entire industry. Regardless, the report, which advised marketers to take a closer look at their agency relationships and contracts, sparked a wave of big-name marketers commissioning third-party auditing companies to examine their media-buying agencies. Some agencies are paying clients in the form of cash or significantly capped fees, rather than disclose all their contracts Media-buying companies are employed by advertisers to secure them the most strategic and best value-for-money advertising slots. When companies appoint auditors to look at their media agency relationships, they are looking for reassurance that they are getting what they paid for when it comes to their advertising spend and that the agency has been compliant with their contract. Sometimes, audits result in overpayments being returned to the company, or contracts being renegotiated. Audits within the industry are normal, but this time around, marketers have been using the findings of the report — plus a contract template provided by the ANA— as leverage to get more detail about the types of agreements their agencies have in place with media owners. As a result, many marketers have been asking more specific questions about media — particularly digital media — that agencies buy upfront in advance and sell back to clients and also for evidence of any agreements agencies have in place with media owners to receive credits — either in the form of cash rebates, free inventory, or other discounts — when their spending (usually across a range of clients) reaches a certain threshold. They have also been asking for information on whether their advertising budgets have been spent on media properties in which the agency owns a stake. But some agencies have been reticent to hand over such information, even if required to do so by the audits rights sections of their contract. Instead, they have negotiated to pay their clients settlements — either in the form of cash or agreeing to significantly cap their fees — rather than disclose those contracts and master services agreements. In the majority of these cases, the contracts between the media agency and client have then been redrawn, with more specific wording around the type of media the marketer agrees can be bought in a non-transparent way. Taking a settlement can be in the interest of the marketer too Buying media in a non-transparent way is not a nefarious activity, so long as the marketer is aware and agrees to it upfront. Some agencies argue that when they take a ""principal position"" in buying media upfront — i.e. by using their own money to buy the media and then selling it at a markup to their clients — they are taking on the risk that they might not eventually sell those ad slots back at-cost or at a profit. And, they argue, they add value through their investments in data and technology that justify selling the media space back at a higher cost than it was bought at. Put it another way: if you buy a car and choose the performance brakes option, you know that the dealership is making an additional profit from the upsell. But it's unlikely you'd ever demand the dealer disclose how much they paid for the brakes. As long as you feel the brakes are performing well, you're happy with the purchase. Opting to take a settlement is often in the best interests of an advertiser too — and they are particularly appealing to their procurement and financial departments, happy to see any savings or clawbacks of cost. A settlement also prevents ruining a relationship by taking the matter to court to force the agency to disclose all their contracts. Litigation is costly and distracting, and could run the risk of exposing the marketer as not being fully aware of how their company's budget was being spent under their watch. It is the marketer's responsibility to ensure their company is getting the most value for money from its advertising spend. The ANA and The 4A's, the trade body that represents US advertising agencies, declined to comment. Business Insider also contacted the six major holding agencies for their comments on this article. Here are their responses: WPP's GroupM: ""As a rule GroupM, does not comment on contractual matters; however, we can confirm that we are not involved in the practices described."" Publicis Groupe: ""Integrity and trust continue to be cornerstones of how we approach relationships with our clients. We continue to comply on client audits as standard agency-client operating procedure, including any audits that have commenced since the ANA practices were announced. We have approached them with deep collaboration with our clients and these audits have resulted satisfactorily with positive conclusion. There has been neither need nor instance of non-disclosure settlements as part of an audit or client discussion."" IPG: ""We do not engage in and are also not aware of such practices. IPG upholds the highest standards of transparency in our media practices, which is key to our decisions not to accept rebates in the U.S. and not to buy 'inventory media.' This long-standing position has been a differentiator for our company."" Dentsu Aegis: Declined to comment. Omnicom: Declined to comment.

555,555,22-07-16 14:10,2016,7,22,Jeff Stein,Americans trust Donald Trump to take on the “special interests.” They shouldn’t.,"Most Republican politicians don’t lament how wealthy donors have corrupted the political system through big campaign contributions. But Donald Trump is not like most Republican politicians. Accepting the party’s presidential nomination on Thursday night, Trump returned to an argument that’s at least superficially similar to one routinely made by the left: that the money sloshing through US politics privileges special interests. Here’s Trump on Thursday night attacking Hillary Clinton as a ""puppet"" of her wealthy donors: A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Big business, elite media, and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. This is a line Trump frequently deployed against his Republican rivals in the primary, calling both Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush ""puppets"" of their big donors. Trump promised to self-fund his campaign instead, arguing that doing so would give him the freedom to act on behalf of the public. The concept has worked brilliantly as a campaign strategy. One MSNBC report found it was the single biggest reason voters thrilled to Trump’s candidacy. It’s also the issue on which Trump consistently beats Clinton in polling: But it also raises a real policy question. Trump may be a white nationalist with dangerously authoritarian tendencies. But isn’t it also theoretically possible that a Trump administration would be better at taking on special interests and lobbyists? Given that Trump is a billionaire who largely self-financed his own primary, isn’t it at least conceivable that he’d be less indebted to big donors than Clinton? I’ve thought a lot about this question and interviewed the leading campaign finance experts over the last several months. But my conclusion is ultimately pretty simple: No, Trump wouldn’t do more to help reduce the role of big money in politics. And he’d actually probably make things a good deal worse. There are a few explanations for why, but the most important thing to recognize may be that Trump actually hasn’t kept his distance from the big donors he claims to despise. On a literal level, there’s really very little daylight between his campaign fundraising operation and Clinton’s. Here’s a brief accounting of just how much Trump has courted the very donors and special interests he claims have corrupted his opponent: But according to the Center for Public Integrity, Trump has now dived headlong into using them himself. At least three Super PACs — with tens of millions of dollars in the bank — are now acting on his behalf to spend money. Now, Super PACs are working on Clinton's behalf as well, and she has maintained that she also wants to do away with them. But Trump’s theory has long been that you can’t both have a Super PAC working in your favor and then claim to govern free of their influence. By his own standard, he’s bought and paid for. Trump has since raised over $32 million by going to these megawealthy donors, according to NPR. About 60 people gave over $100,000 each. ""He's done a complete 180,"" Josh Stewart, a spokesperson for the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks money in politics, told me. Moreover, after criticizing his primary rivals for wantonly ""begging"" the Koch Brothers for money, Trump began asking the Koch organization for help, according to USA Today. ""[Former Trump aide Sam] Nunberg later confessed to me that Trump’s principled stand against the corrupt donor class was little more than lucky spin,"" Coppins reported. ""The truth is, he would have raised money if he could have … Donald never had any intention of self-financing."" According to Coppins, Trump came to reject money in politics because big donors wouldn’t fork over their dough to him — not because of any principled stand. But there’s another, more philosophical reason Trump fundamentally misunderstands the way big money influences our political system — and why he doesn’t offer anything remotely resembling a solution to fix it. Trump’s conception of how money influences politics is clear: Like many Americans, he essentially imagines that Clinton — and his Republican rivals before her — engage in a quid pro quo in which donors are transactionally rewarded for their campaign contributions. This idea posits a direct line of influence from lobbyist to politician, and then back the other way for the return back-scratch. Here’s Trump back during the debates: ""Their lobbyists, their special interests and their donors will start calling President Bush, President Clinton. And they’ll say: ‘You have to do it. They gave you a million dollars to your campaign."" There’s just one problem with this criticism: it’s wrong. According to most campaign finance experts I’ve interviewed, the real problem with our campaign finance system is not that donors are transactionally rewarded for their gifts. Instead, what happens is that politicians’ dependence on special interest money generally elevates the priorities of the wealthy across the board. That itself is a massive problem with corrosive implications for democratic outcomes. In having to raise huge sums of money, politicians end up spending far more time with the superrich than they do with the poor and middle class. That makes them far more attuned to the priorities of elites and the megawealthy. This is what makes Trump's response so off. He's a billionaire notorious for partying it up with the rich and famous. (Several literal billionaires spoke at the RNC convention.) Since he's ordinarily part of elite social circles, he'll be keenly attuned to their issues. Trump has already demonstrated that his presidency would advance policies that favor the wealthy. His tax policy calls for unprecedented tax cuts for the superrich. His family would get a $7 billion windfall from his estate tax plan. He has no plans to raise the minimum wage or make college more affordable. His health care policy would screw millions of poor people. ""You can say that if you're spending your own money, you're free to do what you think and not be obligated to donors,"" Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit that focuses on government transparency and campaign finance, told me in March. ""But the other side of that coin is to say, 'We don't want really wealthy people to buy elections and have a system only run by the superrich.' And Trump doesn't say that.""Trump may look like a quick fix to Americans fed up with the big role money plays in our government. He's not.",https://www.vox.com/2016/7/22/12254266/donald-trump-special-interests,,Vox

558,558,21-11-17 13:50,2017,11,21,Ezra Klein,The best analogy to Donald Trump in 2017 is George W. Bush in 2005,"We are living through unusual times, and the tendency is to reach for extreme historical analogies. I have seen this era compared to the runup to the Civil War, to Watergate, to the dawn of Nazi Germany, to the presidency of Andrew Jackson, to the rise of Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi, to the fall of the Roman Empire. But the most persuasive analogue is nearer both in time and in space. What this period most closely resembles, argues political scientist Brendan Nyhan, is the aftermath of the 2004 election, when George W. Bush defeated John Kerry. Then, like now, a culturally polarizing Republican candidate was narrowly elected after a campaign waged atop nationalistic, identitarian appeals. Then, like now, the GOP gained control of both the White House and Congress. Then, like now, the winner had no clear policy mandate, and quickly suffered massive legislative defeat (Social Security privatization for Bush, Obamacare repeal for Trump). Then, like now, the president watched his favorability ratings tumble into the 30s, and appeared to be headed for a severe backlash in the midterms. I would take the analogy yet further. Trump’s callousness and indiscipline has left many liberals yearning for Bush’s more dignified and decent bearing. A poll in October found that a majority of Democrats now hold a favorable opinion of the 43rd president. But in 2004, Democrats absorbed Bush’s reelection as more than a defeat; it was a cultural rejection and a political crisis. Democrats warned that it was “the most important election of our lifetime.” If John Kerry didn’t win, the results could be, would be, catastrophic. But Bush crushed Democrats with a campaign that, as Robert Reich wrote, was “not just God and gays but also true grit in fighting the evils of Saddam Hussein and global terrorism.” This was the age in which Bill Clinton warned that ""when people are insecure, they'd rather have somebody who is strong and wrong than someone who's weak and right,” the era of flag pins, of Swift Boat Veterans, of books with titles like Bush Country: How Dubya Became a Great President While Driving Liberals Insane. It was the era of anti-same-sex marriage ballot initiatives, of Democrats panicking over the loss of white Christian voters. When Bush won, the left absorbed it as a trauma — proof that they had lost touch with the heartland, that they no longer understood the country they called home. The 2004 election, wrote Paul Starr in the liberal American Prospect, confirmed that Democrats were “no longer a majority party.” In the same magazine, Alan Brinkley wrote, “The greatest success of the modern right has been transforming conservatism into a populist phenomenon.” Sound familiar? Just wait. In the New York Times, the headline was “Baffled in Loss, Democrats Seek Road Forward.” The article records a litany of prominent Democrats unloading their fears and their confusion. “We need to be a party that stands for more than the sum of our resentments,” said Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat then in the Senate. “In the heartland, where I am from, there are doubts. Too often, we're caricatured as a bicoastal cultural elite that is condescending at best and contemptuous at worst to the values that Americans hold in their daily lives."" All of this could have been said by, and written, about, Democrats in the aftermath of 2016. And it yields, I think, a few lessons. Today, 2004 is one of the few elections I know of that many Democrats believe it’s better that they lost. Had they won, it would have been President John Kerry facing a Republican Congress, managing the flailing Iraq War, and ultimately blindsided by the financial crisis. The congressional majorities Democrats built in 2006 and then expanded on in 2008 — the majorities that permitted the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the stimulus and much else — would never have materialized. Bush’s continued presence in office meant Republicans paid the political price for their past mistakes, and Democrats reaped the rewards. A similar future is plausible, though far from assured, today. With the important exception of replacing Justice Antonin Scalia with Neil Gorsuch, Trump and the Republican Congress appear to be getting less done, and paying more of a political price, than most expected. It seems possible now that Democrat Doug Jones will win Jeff Sessions’s Senate seat in Alabama; if that happens, retaking both the House and the Senate is well within reach for Democrats in 2018, putting an end to Trump’s legislative agenda. If Trump’s presidency continues to flail — to say nothing of if there’s a recession or a poorly managed foreign crisis — it’s easy to imagine a Democrat beating him in 2020 and entering office with massive congressional majorities, setting up, again, a period of sweeping progressive governance. The down-ballot gains could also lead to more Democratic statehouses before the next census, which would in turn mean less Republican gerrymandering and a significantly improved House outlook for Democrats through 2030. The cultural forces Trump represents also seem weakened by his ascent. Opinions toward trade and immigration have swung sharply to the left since Trump’s election, and the acceptance of sexual harassment that Trump’s win seemed to suggest has been overwhelmed by the stunning power of the #MeToo movement. Which is all to say that one lesson of the post-2004 moment is low ebbs in political power sometimes set up massive gains in political power, particularly when the governing party governs poorly. Just as Democrats regret Bush’s second term less, and Republicans regret it more, than either side expected at the time, the same could well prove true of Trump — particularly if the loathing he inspires among younger voters hardens into a persistent distaste for the GOP. Another lesson is that the path back to power often looks very different from what the post-election analyses suggest. The Democrats agonizing over evangelical heartland voters and whether they had any candidates who looked natural holding a hunting rifle did not think their resurgence lay with a cosmopolitan, liberal African American whose name rhymed with “Osama.” But it did. The same is true for Republicans who worried over Barack Obama’s victories and the rising Democratic majority. Readers of the GOP’s post-2012 “autopsy” report know that the party expected it would be a candidate with Marco Rubio’s profile that led them back to the majority. “We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too. We must recruit more candidates who come from minority communities,” warned the party that would soon nominate Donald Trump and win back the White House. It’s a mistake to think that the only way to win an election is to win over your opponent’s coalition, rather than creating a new version of your own. For all the debates about the white working class and identity politics currently roiling the Democratic Party, my guess is if Democrats are successful in 2020, it will be with a candidate who transcends these arguments rather than one who embodies them. But the most important lesson is that the story of American politics is ongoing and unpredictable. We tend to take elections as the closing of chapters, as statements about what America really believes and where we are truly going. Yet they’re anything but. In 2004, Democrats could not imagine where they would be in 2008. In 2014, no one believed Donald Trump would be president today — including Donald Trump. History shows American politics is often far from what it seems, and you don’t need to reach long into our past for examples.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/21/16676390/donald-trump-george-bush-historical-analogies,,Vox
559,559,01-03-18 00:00,2018,3,1,"Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch",Exclusive: Israel's El Al seeks international help to access Saudi airspace,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s flag carrier El Al has asked an airline industry lobby group to help it access Saudi Arabian airspace, so it can compete with Air India’s [AIN.UL] planned route between India and Israel.  The request came in a letter on Wednesday from El Al’s chief executive to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in which he said he has also approached Israel’s prime minister.  Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel though there has been a thawing of the relationship between the U.S. allies, with a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region. Granting an Israeli airline access to its air space by lifting a 70-year-old ban, however, would mark a dramatic diplomatic shift.  The appeal is a response to plans revealed by Air India last month to begin direct flights to Tel Aviv which pass through Saudi airspace, a shorter route so far off-limits to all Israel-bound commercial planes. There has been no official announcement whether Air India has received permission to fly over Saudi soil for its proposed thrice-weekly flights.  El Al’s CEO has now turned to the head of IATA, Alexandre de Juniac, saying he understood no such permission would be granted to Israeli jetliners and asking Juniac to step in to prevent “an uneven playing field.”  “I am approaching you and kindly requesting IATA to intervene and to represent aviation industry’s interest by advocating equal overfly rights for all carriers over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and opposing any form of discrimination,” CEO Gonen Usishkin wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.  IATA’s membership includes 280 airlines in 120 countries.  Usishkin said he has also requested help from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resolve the issue.  El Al has yet to receive a response.  El Al currently flies four weekly flights to Mumbai, but these take seven hours rather than five as they take a route south towards Ethiopia and then east to India, avoiding Saudi airspace. Shortening the route would also be a significant cost-cutter.  Air India has not received any communication yet from the aviation regulator, a company spokesman said when asked whether the airline had received permission to operate flights to Israel over the Saudi airspace.  The proposed India-Israel route is a result of strengthening ties between the two countries.  In his letter Usishkin, who became CEO two weeks ago, said Air India’s flights are scheduled to begin on March 6, citing slot information from Israel’s Airports Authority.

In a new video, Billboard dance editor Matt Medved conducts a straight-faced interview with the humorist and his hype man, the New York DJ Maachew Bentley. After introducing himself as ""Diplo"" before clarifying, ""no, I'm Josh!"" Ostrovsky explains how ""all of the greatest musical acts throughout history have had tribute acts. Major Lazer are one of the greatest musical acts in history, and they needed a tribute act."" ""Who are the greatest Jamaicans?"" he continues. ""Bob Marley, Hailie Selassie, and Diplo."" Ostrovsky's humor has less to do with what he's saying than how he says it—he's skilled at milking monstrous amounts of affect from his hammy physical presence, even when the material is thin. That talent comes in handy here. When Ostrovsky humps a speaker at Guitar Center his body ripples like flan. He rescues a weak joke—""I was in a Skrillex cover group called wooomp""—with an eyes-closed expression so lugubrious you can't help but chuckle. Ostrovsky is funny in the elemental way that sports mascots or rubber balls are funny. Major Behavior's effectiveness as satire is limited, though, because Diplo doesn't take himself too seriously to begin with. Major Lazer—which started out in the late 00s as a sincere attempt to bridge Caribbean dancehall with American electronic pop—has since metastasized into a winningly goofy brand that provides a tongue-in-cheek Twerking Experience at festivals and undergrad Spring Formals. Headlines like ""Diplo Attempts to Break Twerking ""World Record"" With Twerk-Wall at Electric Zoo"" and videos like ""Bubble Butt"" demonstrate how Major Lazer have immunized themselves to parody through winking exaggeration. As such, Major Behavior feels less like a biting critique of the group and more like a brand extension. Presumably this all culminates with Ostrovsky taking the stage at a Major Lazer show, clad in gold hot pants and slapping his belly to the beat of ""Pon De Floor.""

562,562,29-03-16 08:30,2016,3,29,Mark Bergen,Google's Alphabet Has a CEO Problem,"The Alphabet companies not named Google make up just 6 percent of the entire tech conglomeration’s workforce, but they account for a growing share of its headaches. Those frustrations are less about the technical hurdles of these lofty moonshots than a concern commonplace with startups: A crisis of leadership. Google co-founders, now Alphabet honchos, really want to replicate their search engine’s success across a range of industries with operations run like startups. To do that, though, they have to face a dilemma inherent in their structure. That is, they must find execs willing to work within Alphabet’s corporate umbrella, and teams willing to work with their chosen execs. A trio of developments has emerged in the last two weeks underscoring this tension. First, there was the Bloomberg report that Google is selling Boston Dynamics, its unit that builds dexterous, humanoid robots. Then there was a damning tale of the struggles inside Nest, Alphabet’s connected device company, and its mercurial CEO, Tony Fadell. Finally, the bio-tech trade publication STAT released another damning story on Monday about Verily, Alphabet’s life sciences company, accusing its chief exec of alienating employees and business partners. With the first two cases, Alphabet’s newfound financial strictness was named as a key factor. Bloomberg cited internal emails from a Google exec voicing concern over the unit’s lack of a short-term revenue plan. Similarly, Fadell pointed to the parent company’s prudence to defend troubles at his own. “The fiscal discipline era has now descended upon everything,” Fadell told The Information. (Google and its Alphabets all declined to comment.) It’s true that, with Google’s new structure, the company is attempting to manage costs and revenue roadmaps for its most ambitious endeavors. But that’s only half the story. Consider the other grandiose projects within Alphabet — self-driving cars, Internet balloons and the longevity-research lab Calico — that don’t appear to face pressure to generate cash immediately. (Aside from Nest, Verily and Google Fiber, the broadband business, no other non-Google company produces any revenue now.) According to these three reports and multiple sources, the root of these particular corporate hiccups is with leadership squabbles, namely with the exec at the top. For Nest, some of the business’s difficulties stemmed from internal clashes, primarily around the acquisition of security-camera startup Dropcam, which soured dramatically. Several former employees accuse Fadell of a micromanagement that stifles product releases. Fadell openly belittled Dropcam’s staff to The Information, calling them “not as good as [he] had hoped.” Others familiar with Nest spoke of a mismatch of expectations internally and a rift between Fadell’s assertive style and the more experimental, laissez-faire culture at Google. While Nest suffers from executive turmoil, Alphabet’s robotics struggle has the opposite problem: A leadership vacuum. Boston Dynamics came to Google with its slew of robotics acquisitions in 2013, orchestrated by former Android chief Andy Rubin. The robot makers operated fairly independently from the others, which were primarily software focused, but remained integral to Rubin’s vision of a formidable artificial intelligence operation, according to a source familiar with the deal. But Rubin left a year after. And until recently, the entire division was essentially homeless inside Google, draining talent steadily; James Kuffner, who filled Rubin’s spot, left for Toyota in January. Likewise, the STAT story reveals a steady exodus of top-level medical talent from Alphabet’s Verily, reportedly over discontent with its CEO, Andy Conrad. Our earlier reporting on Verily, which has eked out some revenue in pharmaceutical partnerships, has developed a reputation in the biotech industry for a lack of focus. Michael Luther, a former research partner with Conrad, gave the publication this blistering quote: “We used to joke and call [Conrad] the ‘seagull of science.’ He used to fly in, squawk, crap over everything, and fly away.” Earlier this month, at a conference in San Diego, Conrad said he was planning to add a thousand staffers in the coming months.

563,563,08-08-17 07:04,2017,8,8,Pilot Viruet,"Laverne Cox, Lena Waithe, and More Explain Why Representation Matters","At Friday's Television Critics Association press tour, GLAAD hosted two panels dedicated to emphasizing the necessity of representation in media: ""Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Trends on TV"" and ""Transgender Trends on TV."" Each panel boasted an impressive roster of names: The first featured Megan Townsend (director of entertainment research at GLAAD), Stephanie Beatriz (Danger & Eggs), Wilson Cruz (Star Trek: Discovery), Pete Nowalk (How To Get Away with Murder), Lena Waithe (Master of None), and Emily Andras (Wynonna Earp); the second featured Nick Adams (director of transgender media & representation at GLAAD), Alexandra Billings (HTGAWM), Laverne Cox (Orange Is The New Black), Jill Soloway (Transparent), Shadi Petosky (Danger & Eggs), and Rhys Ernst (Transparent). The panels—easily my personal highlight of the tour so far—were both informative and imperative and a welcome addition. Even though it may seem like television has been making strides to push away from the cis-, straight-, and male-dominated narratives that are abundant in media, it's still very obvious that we have a lot of work to do. As the GLAAD presentation noted, even though there has been an increase in LGBTQ characters (it counted 278 regular and recurring on television and streaming), it's not enough when you take into account how much television there is (and that these characters, when they do exist, are still mostly male and white). Transgender characters are even more scarce: There are only 11 trans characters, and three are of them are on Transparent. And, Townsend emphasized, so many of these characters still fall prey to stereotypes—particularly bisexual characters. Men are ""portrayed as these kind of wicked, villainous characters"" whose bisexuality is tied to why they're ""bad"" people while women are ""depicted as lacking morals or kind of to be scheming manipulators."" (TV Tropes calls this the ""Depraved Bisexual"" and features many examples.) As for the ""Bury Your Gays"" trope, since 2015, more than 50 queer women have been killed on television, and two queer characters were killed off just last week (on Power and Kingdom).  When these deaths occur over and over, ""as a queer woman, if you're watching TV, you kind of learn 'OK, I can't have a happy ending. I am never going to find love. I'm not going to live a happy, long life with my partner,'"" said Townsend. During both panels, panelists echoed how much we need positive representation because often, how our identities are portrayed on television can dictate how people view us in real life—or how we view ourselves. As Nick Adams explained, GLAAD looked at 134 episodes (aired between 2002 to 2014) with trans characters and ""88 percent of them were either straight up defamatory or barely passable as mediocre."" They were psychopaths, murderers, victims, ""a dead body laying on the ground,"" and sex worker was the most common profession. These negative portrayals have lasting, harmful effects on trans folks, especially younger children and teens. Transparent director Rhys Ernst recalled a specific memory of the first time he saw a trans man on television: ""The way he was depicted was so sad and horrible and pitying. Everybody sort of stared at him like he was such a freak, and it was just mortifying. And I immediately identified that I was like him,"" Ernst said, explaining that he wanted to hide that part of him because he couldn't stomach the image. Jill Soloway brought up the ""It's Pat"" recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live as being an ""awful piece of anti-trans propaganda"" and a ""hateful, awful thing to do to non-binary people."" Alexandra Billings, who talked bluntly about how trans women of color are ""systematically hunted"" and about her ""many nights in jail"" because she wasn't wearing at least three articles of male clothing, later said that ""the fact that we have any kind of trans representation on television right now that is positive, that speaks to people of color—that is inclusive—is remarkable and a gift."" Intersectionality was also an important topic of the panels. Lena Waithe, who wrote Master of None's standout ""Thanksgiving"" episode (and became the first black woman nominated for an Emmy in comedy writing), spoke about how she felt a personal responsibility to tell stories for queer people of color, but she's still trying to convince ""certain networks and studios to make shows where a queer person of color is the lead. ""Insecure is phenomenal, but now imagine if Issa's character is a lesbian. How dope would that be?"" But, Waithe said, she still needs ""the business to kind of work with me.""  It's so vital for young people—and particularly young people of color—to see themselves reflected back on the screen in positive, multi-dimensional characters. That's what makes shows like Danger & Eggs so essential, as Stephanie Beatriz explained. Amazon's animated children's series—created by trans woman Shadi Petosky—features queer, trans, and non-binary characters, with the season finale even taking place during a pride parade. ""It's so critical to me that that show and others like it are introduced to children at an early age... I believe in that show so much that I literally got one of the characters tattooed on my arm.""  A television series like Danger & Eggs helps children see themselves and feel better and more accepting of their own identities (and those of others), whatever those may be. Throughout the discussion, many of the panelists spoke about what an impact seeing positive representations of their identity on screen had on their lives: Waithe cited when Shug and Celie kissed in The Color Purple; Laverne Cox mentioned Candis Cayne on Dirty Sexy Money. These characters allowed Waithe and Cox to see themselves—now, they want to do the same for others.  It should be noted, an ultimate goal these panelists share isn't to litter television with perfect LGBTQ characters but rather to get to a point where these characters aren't just defined by being members of the LGBTQ community. They want them to be heroes and villains, and everything in between. ""I don't think anybody up here would say that there are not LGBTQ people who do not do bad things,"" Wilson Cruz said, and continued that the problem stems from these characters being depicted as bad because they're also gay or trans. ""We're all human beings,"" Cruz affirmed, ""And as an actor, you want the opportunity to play a human, not a caricature or a cartoon.""

Riyadh announced the reform plan in 2016, with goals ranging from overhauling its state-owned Public Investment Fund to increasing visits of Muslim pilgrims and encouraging more Saudis to play sports.   Despite last October’s murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents, big investors are pushing ahead with deals and pouring money back into its stock market as well as Vision 2030 projects that aim to diversify the economy of the world’s top oil exporter and create jobs.  “Saudi wants to do the utmost to continue our old - but new - strong partnership with Japan,” the crown prince told Abe through an interpreter.

566,566,05-07-19 00:00,2019,7,5,John Kemp,RPT-COLUMN-U.S. diesel consumption hit by economic slowdown: Kemp,"(Repeats July 4 column with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.)  * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2FPNnDi  By John Kemp  LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - U.S. consumption of diesel and other middle distillate fuels is decelerating in line with the wider slowdown in manufacturing and construction activity.  Consumption of distillate fuel oil was up by 3% in the three months from February to April compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Consumption growth has fallen from more than 5% year-on-year in the three months from August to October and the trend is slowing despite short-term volatility (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, June 28).  Distillate fuel oils are mostly used in manufacturing, freight transport, construction, mining, oil and gas production, and farming - as well as small amounts for home and commercial heating, especially in the U.S. northeast.  Distillate consumption is therefore most heavily exposed to the business cycle and the recent slowdown is consistent with business surveys and government data showing the rate of economic growth is decelerating.  Farm diesel consumption has been hit by heavy rains and flooding across the Midwest which has delayed or even cancelled the traditional planting season.  Midwest distillate consumption was up by just 2% in February-April compared with the same period a year earlier, down from peak growth of more than 4% in August-October.  But the distillate slowdown cannot be wholly or mainly attributed to the farm sector’s severe weather problems (tmsnrt.rs/2FPNnDi).  Fuel consumption has slowed even more sharply in the states along the East Coast to less than 1% in February-April down from almost 7% in August-October.  Gulf Coast and West Coast consumption growth also shows signs of levelling off or slowing after accelerating for much of last year.  Slowing distillate consumption growth is consistent with a broad range of other indicators pointing to a sharp slowdown in manufacturing and a downturn in construction and freight transportation.  Hedge funds have responded by turning a bullish net long position in distillate futures and options of as much as 63 million barrels in October into a bearish net short position of 19 million barrels by the middle of June.  By June, hedge funds’ outlook for distillate prices, as measured by the ratio of their long to short positions, had become the most negative since the middle of 2017 and before that the economy-wide slowdown of 2015/16.  Since then, fund managers have covered some of their short positions, which has helped lift oil prices from their mid-June lows.  The outlook for the rest of the year depends on whether the current softness in manufacturing and construction activity proves to be just a mid-cycle slowdown followed by re-acceleration or an end-of-cycle recession.

568,568,06-09-18 00:00,2018,9,6,Nate Raymond,Maryland charges Insys with engaging in deceptive opioid scheme,"(Reuters) - Maryland on Thursday charged Insys Therapeutics Inc with deceptively marketing a powerful opioid pain killer so that it was prescribed inappropriately beyond its intended use with cancer patients.  Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh announced that he had filed administrative charges against Arizona-based Insys, which he said provided thousands of dollars in inducements to doctors to promote prescribing its medication Subsys to their patients.  The company declined comment. It has said that it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again.  Maryland alleged the company influenced doctors to prescribe the drug beyond its labeled use with inducements that included payments purported to be compensation for participating in educational events.  In one instance the company supplied the drug for a doctor’s own illegal use and in another a sales representative engaged in a sexual relationship with a doctor, the state said.  The state alleged that over 90 percent of the prescriptions for Subsys in Maryland ultimately were for patients who should never have received the product, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.  “The allegations against Insys describe a calculated scheme employing doctors, pharmacist, and sales reps to increase profits and market share at the expense of the health and well-being of vulnerable patients,” Frosh said in a statement.  The state’s case, which would be heard by an administrative law judge, seeks to recover of all funds Insys earned through the scheme plus penalties. Frosh’s office said Insys earned more than $20 million in Maryland from its conduct.  The case added to the legal woes of Insys, whose former top executives have been caught up in a federal criminal investigation into accusations the company paid medical practitioners kickbacks to prescribe Subsys.  Those executives include billionaire founder John Kapoor, who has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Insys in August said it reached a deal to pay at least $150 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.  Federal prosecutors in Boston say that beginning in 2012, Kapoor, former Chief Executive Michael Babich and others conspired to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and to defraud insurers into paying for it. Babich has also pleaded not guilty.  Insys previously settled cases by attorneys general in Oregon, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Illinois for $9.45 million. It faces lawsuits by several other states as well.

Since raising $4.4 billion from SoftBank — whose CEO has told founder Adam Neumann to grow WeWork “10 times bigger than your original plan” — the company has been acquiring companies at a rapid pace, averaging one about every two months. Most of its deals have been outside of WeWork’s core business of renting out work space, ranging from education tech to apps for construction workers, and have been for undisclosed amounts. Here’s a frequently updated list of the companies WeWork has acquired: Naked Hub (April 2018) — A Chinese co-working startup with a large presence in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. The deal marks WeWork’s second acquisition of a co-working competitor. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Bloomberg reported the sale was for $400 million. The move comes at a time when WeWork is planning most of its growth outside the U.S. Conductor (March 2018) — A digital marketing startup that helps businesses target advertisements to their customers based on user data. WeWork says it plans to run Conductor as a separate line of business available to WeWork members and non-members. Meetup (November 2017) — The website that CEO Scott Heiferman started with the idea to “use the internet to get people off the internet” and help people with similar interests — say, vegetarian rock climbers or corgi owners — meet up in real life and do things together. WeWork acquired it for around $200 million, according to Axios. Neumann said WeWork plans to use Meetup to “bring people together around the things that matter most to them.” Flatiron School (October 2017) — A private coding academy in Manhattan that specializes in a 15-week software engineering program. WeWork has since expanded it by opening a school in Brooklyn that offers students no tuition upfront, but instead a repayment plan. Unomy (August 2017) — An Israeli sales and marketing platform tech company. According to its website, it’s no longer offered as a service, and shut down as of September 2017. Spacemob (August 2017) — A Singapore-based co-working company. Soon after the acquisition, WeWork allotted $500 million for expansion to Southeast Asia and South Korea. Fieldlens (June 2017) — Mobile apps designed for construction workers to communicate faster. Welkio (March 2016) — A digital sign-in system for guests at an office. Case (August 2015) — A firm that built technology for property builders. WeWork has since made Case’s apps open source. In addition to these acquisitions, in the past year WeWork has also bought a large stake in Wavegarden, which makes wave pools; purchased the iconic Lord & Taylor flagship department store building on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, which will serve as its new corporate headquarters; and led a $32 million investment round in The Wing, a co-working/membership club for women.

572,572,24-08-18 12:40,2018,8,24,Brian Resnick,"Genetic risk for heart attacks, and the new tests to find it, explained","In the United States, around 735,000 people each year have a heart attack. In all, heart disease (and its complications, including heart attacks) kills 610,000 a year here, making it the leading cause of death in America and worldwide. Preventing heart disease is a huge public health challenge. And right now doctors have good, but limited, options for finding out who is at greatest risk for it. Doctors know that about half the risk for heart disease comes from lifestyle choices: how much, and what, a person is eating, how much alcohol they drink, if they smoke. The other half is related to genetics, and it’s much harder to assess. You can ask a person about their family history of heart disease and can check for high blood pressure and obesity, which are also related to genetics. But up until the recent explosion in genetic science, it was hard to probe the genes themselves. Last week, in the journal Nature Genetics, researchers at Harvard University and the Broad Institute published evidence that they can check out 6 million spots in a person’s genome to assess their risk for developing coronary artery disease, when the main blood vessel supplying the heart with oxygen gets clogged with plaque. It’s a precursor to a heart attack, when a clot cuts off blood flow to the heart, starving it of oxygen. In the study, people who carried the greatest number of genetic variants suggestive of heart attack risk were three or more times likely to develop coronary artery disease than controls. The researchers argue that with this test, about one in 12 people could be identified as having a higher risk of heart attack based on their genetics alone. “If you told me there was a genetic score that could identify 8 percent of the population with more than a threefold risk, I’d say, that’s amazing,” Robert Yeh, a cardiologist at the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, who was not involved in the study, says. Currently, the best commonly available genetic test for heart disease risk — which looks for a single gene linked to high cholesterol — can only detect increased risk in 0.4 percent of people. “The big takeaway is that we can now capture the inherited component to heart attack risk with a single number,” Sekar Kathiresan, the Massachusetts General Hospital cardiologist and geneticist who led the study, says. With this new tool, Kathiresan hopes doctors could put those people at higher risk on cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) at an earlier age, or more easily persuade them to make lifestyle changes to lower their risk. The new tool here is called a polygenic risk score, which you can think of as a tally of the tiny changes in your genome that are correlated with risk of developing a disease. In the coming years, you’re going to hear a lot more about them. These scores, while increasingly helpful in some areas of medicine, come with a lot of caveats. Indeed, when you dig a bit deeper into this latest Nature Genetics paper, you find there’s a lot more work to do to validate polygenic risk scores for heart disease, so they will be useful and relevant to people around the globe. For one: This study was exclusively conducted with subjects in the UK of white European background. The predictions derived from this group do not necessarily transfer over to another. For this and other reasons, scientists skeptical of polygenic risk scores say they are not yet ready for the clinic — and wonder if they will ever be. At the same time, it seems likely these polygenic risk scores are going to change the way we think about our health and our medical decision-making. Over the past decade, medical researchers have realized that our risk for many common conditions like heart disease and diabetes are not influenced by just one gene, or even a small handful of them. Instead, studies analyzing huge numbers of human genomes have found that there are hundreds of genes that work in constellation influencing our risk for diseases. DNA is the recipe for our biology. But it turns out that recipe looks something like an M.C. Escher drawing, with a huge number of genes influencing life outcomes in hard-to-understand, hard-to-follow, interconnected ways. That is, there can be hundreds of interrelated spots in the genome that are correlated with a person’s risk for heart disease, or raising or lowering their height by a millimeter. Scientists are getting better at identifying these spots in the genome that confer risk and are now trying to figure out if tallying up these genetic changes — in what’s known as a “polygenic risk score” — is useful in trying to predict, and prevent, disease. (They are also calculating them for behavioral traits like educational attainment.) In developing polygenic risk scores, in many cases, genetics researchers often don’t know what the underlying genes do. All they know is that these genes are correlated with — which does not mean cause — the disease. “It’s pretty mindless,” says Cecile Janssens, an epidemiologist at Emory University who is critical of the hype of polygenic risk scores. Proponents of polygenic scoring, though, argue that you don’t need to know what the genes are doing to make predictions off them. “It’s all about getting a predictor and then repeating it in other groups,” Kathiresan says. “At the end of the day, I could just call it a magic number generator. It doesn’t exactly matter how I’m getting there, as long as it works in other groups equally well.” That’s what happened in this latest paper. A polygenic risk score derived from huge genome-wide association studies predicted heart attack risk in nearly 300,000 people in the UK. (Read more about how scientists come up with polygenic risk scores here.) Because each change in the genome — called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snip”) — confers such a tiny change in risk, adding more and more of them to the risk score yields diminishing returns. “We see this trend already for years — every new SNP that we discover has a smaller effect than we knew already,” Janssens, says. In the recent Nature Genetics study, she points out, when the researchers increased the number of SNPs in their risk model from 74 to 6 million, the predictive power of the test only increased by a smidgen. Most of those SNPs have a predictive power of approximately zero. Here’s a chart showing where the polygenic risk score for coronary artery disease matters most. Polygenic scores, like so many human traits, are normally distributed, meaning they follow the pattern of the bell curve. But a person’s risk for coronary artery disease really only starts to increase if they have the very highest number of SNPs that are correlated with heart disease risk. The top 8 percent of the participants had a three times greater risk of heart disease. The top 0.5 percent had five times the risk. There are many caveats to this risk prediction, which the authors of the study acknowledge. One is that it’s currently unclear if predicting heart attack risk in this manner provides an additional benefit to the risk models derived from asking people simple questions about their lifestyle and family history. The researchers suspect it does, but they didn’t set up their study to test this question. Another is that this risk model was developed and tested solely on people who had donated their medical and genetic information to the UK Biobank, which contains only genetic data of people of white, European ancestry. The predictive power of these tests is expected to diminish in people of African ancestry, Asian ancestry, and so on. Genetics researchers will need to repeat polygenic risk studies with data from these populations if these predictions are truly going to be useful and equitable. And yet one more: We shouldn’t take it for granted that intervening with early medication or lifestyle changes for the people at highest risk will make a difference in lowering their risk. Other studies have found that people with higher genetic risk scores for atherosclerosis tend to receive a stronger benefit from statins. But the question needs further testing. All that said, Yeh, the research cardiologist, says there’s still a lot of optimism around these scores. Current risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure or family history, don’t always help single out who truly is most at risk. “The majority of being who develop coronary artery disease are not people who have a multitude of cardiac risk factors,” Yeh says. “About half of people have just one risk factor, high blood pressure alone. People like that, although they only have one cardiac risk factor, sometimes none, they wouldn’t think of themselves of [having] a very high elevated risk for coronary artery disease.” A genetic risk factor could help narrow it down. Polygenic risk scores, says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and geneticist with Scripps Research, “are going to take hold in common medical practice. It’s a matter of when, not if.” And they’ll be used for conditions outside of heart disease. Indeed, in the latest Nature Genetics study, the researchers also calculated risk scores for diabetes, atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm), inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. The genetic tests for these conditions found fewer people at elevated risk than the tests for heart disease. And not every test will be equally predictive. Kathiresan points out that while only 8 percent of the study participants were singled out for elevated risk for coronary artery disease, about 20 percent of all the participants were flagged as having elevated risk for at least one of the diseases listed above. And while these scores are now being generated for all kinds of health and behavioral issues, medicine isn’t really ready to implement them. Huge questions remain. For instance, while it’s possible to do a genetic risk assessment of an infant, or even an embryo, does it make sense or is it even ethical for new parents to learn their embryos or newborns are at a threefold risk for heart disease? Doctors will also have to think long and hard about how they discuss these kinds of risks with their patients. Scoring in the 70th percentile of risk for coronary artery disease may sound scary, but it won’t increase a person’s chances of getting that disease by all that much. There are also likely to be unintended consequences of giving patients a new health metric to fear. Consider what happened with cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease that people began being commonly tested for in the 1980s. Fear of cholesterol came to inspire low-fat food trends. Those dietary trends made food companies money, but they didn’t necessarily make people healthier, especially as many of the foods marketed as low-fat were still loaded with sugar. What happens when some huckster starts selling vitamins to complement a polygenic risk score, or some other forms of woo? (Currently, you can buy a customized diet guide based on a sequencing of your DNA.) There’s a lot of education that needs to happen here to prevent genetic risk prediction from becoming genetic astrology. For now, aside from a polygenic risk score for breast cancer, these tests don’t yet exist in the clinic. But they’re going to get easier and easier to discover on your own. If you have your genetics data from a commercial company like 23andMe, you can upload it to a number of sites on the internet to see your risk scores for a slew of traits and diseases. Kathiresan’s team is hoping to build a free tool for people to assess their coronary artery disease risk in this manner. Here’s a reasonable fear: It’s going to be hard for consumers, without much input from doctors, to know when the risk scores matter and when they do not. Heck, you can currently take a genetics test for intelligence that really won’t tell you anything valuable. It’s possible to develop polygenic risk score for loneliness, baldness, marital status, or really any human trait that is even vaguely influenced by genes. It takes more information — like odds ratios — to know whether those scores really matter in your life. It will also be hard to know what to do to diminish risk. A high polygenic score for breast cancer might mean a woman wants to make more frequent mammogram appointments, Janssens says. But the current recommendations for people at higher risk of heart disease are things everyone should be doing: living a healthy lifestyle free of tobacco. “I actually think there’s going to be a whole [medical] field that emerges, kind of like radiology emerged in 1900 with the invention of X-rays,” Kathiresan says, “where [doctors] are basically interpreting that genetic information for medical risk.” That field needs to start up soon, because there’s a lot more coming.",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/24/17759772/genetics-polygenic-risk-heart-disease-nature,,Vox

We’re all doomed to become ""house cats"" if the machines so desire! Or so prominent experts like Elon Musk have warned. Humbug, say Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky. On the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, the co-founders of Numenta (who previously co-founded Palm and Handspring) predicted AI will indeed drive technological advances for the rest of the century ... but they threw water on the idea that intelligent machines would behave as they do in popular fiction. ""There’s very smart people, whether it’s Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or Stephen Hawking, who have said, ‘Oh my gosh, this is really dangerous,’"" Hawkins said. ""You imagine these things becoming crazy and alive and taking over the world. It is so far from that, it is crazy. The current technology is not even on a road to true intelligence. It’s just not going to happen."" Dubinsky explained that a lot of what we call machine learning today isn’t learning in the traditional sense. Computers are being taught to recognize, for instance, pictures of cats by being shown millions of pictures that have already been labeled ""cat."" However, Numenta claims that it is trying to develop artificial intelligence that thinks the way a human does ... to a point. ""This is a generalized approach,"" Dubinsky said. ""It’s about a learning machine. Your child is born and its brain doesn’t have stuff in it. It learns from what it’s exposed to."" Hawkins stressed that Numenta is specifically trying to reverse engineer only part of the human brain: The neocortex, which is what lets us learn and create a model of the world based on our environments and experiences. The company is officially uninterested in engineering the 25 percent of the brain that controls emotions like anger. ""We didn't evolve to do mathematics, but our brains can do it,"" he said. ""Imagine you could build a brain that’s a million times faster than a human, never gets tired, and it’s tuned to be a mathematician. We could advance mathematical theories extremely rapidly."" ""This machine doesn’t want to eat, it doesn’t want to have sex, it’s not jealous that you got the tuna sandwich,"" Hawkins added. ""That’s the kind of thing we can look forward to: Machines that are brilliant and smart."" On the new podcast, Dubinsky and Hawkins also discussed their history as entrepreneurial partners dating back to the early 1990s, the biggest challenges currently facing machine intelligence and why you shouldn’t listen to tech pundits who won’t shut up about mobile. ""I find it very amusing when people now say, ‘The future is mobile!’"" Dubinsky said. ""No, no, no. Seeing that the future was mobile 20 years before it happened is the hard part. Seeing that the future is mobile once you’re in the midst of it, that’s not the future any more.""

574,574,18-01-18 18:59,2018,1,18,Tony Romm,A bill to put more self-driving cars on U.S. roads is stuck in the Senate,"An ambitious attempt by U.S. lawmakers to put more self-driving cars on the country’s roads has stalled out in the Senate, where some Democrats are raising new doubts about the technology. For a few senior party lawmakers, the fear is that these computer-driven vehicles aren’t yet ready for major roadways or might be susceptible to cyber attacks. So they’re standing in the way of a Senate vote on the bill, demanding changes that they say are essential to protect riders’ safety. Chief among the critics is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose state of California is a home base and critical testing ground for companies like Uber, Tesla and Google. In December, Feinstein sounded off in early opposition to lawmakers’ self-driving car bill. And in an interview Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol, the Democratic lawmaker doubled down — stressing that she is “apprehensive as to whether we’re ready” for a world in which highly autonomous sedans share the road with humans. “It seems to me that you have to have a period of time where these cars are put on roads, but not necessarily heavily impacted California freeways that are going 65 to 75 miles an hour,” she said. “That’s my view, and I’m a driver, and I know I wouldn’t feel very comfortable.” In California, though, Google search giant’s self-driving car division, Waymo, racked up roughly 636,000 miles’ worth of rides on local roads just last year. In a sign of the stakes, the company even paid Feinstein a visit in Washington, D.C., this week to try to pitch her on the technology. “People need to be assured, and they need to be assured over time,” Feinstein told Recode. “And you can’t just dump something on a freeway and have people looking over saying, ‘My God, there’s no driver.’” Members of Congress first set their sights on autonomous vehicles this spring, beginning in the House. Lawmakers there specifically sought to help tech giants and automakers obtain special exemptions so that they could test droves of new experimental vehicles around the country — without adhering to the same safety standards that apply to older cars. Their bill, called the Self-Drive Act, won swift, broad approval from House Democrats and Republicans alike. But the Senate has squabbled a bit more over its own proposal, the AV START Act. Since last fall, chamber pols have raised a litany of objections, from the protections afforded to driver data collected by cars to the effects they might have on the trucking industry. And when architects like Republican Sen. John Thune sought to bring the bill up for a speedy, final vote, some skeptical Democrats and Republicans intervened to hit the brakes, placing official holds on the measure that prevented it from being considered and approved. Among those expressing skepticism at the time was Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who told Recode in a statement that autonomous-driving technology is still “an emerging and unproven technology.” “As it stands, this bill does not include enough protections to keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe,” he said in December, “but I’m hopeful we can strengthen these safeguards while allowing for limited testing and continued innovation.” His office did not comment this week as to whether the senator remains opposed. Last month, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey similarly raised a formal objection with the bill. And on Thursday, an aide to the Democratic lawmaker said he still has his doubts — and aims to “strengthen provisions in the bill related to automotive defects, cyberattacks, and consumer privacy, especially on the privacy provisions.” Despite those setbacks, the authors of self-driving car legislation said this week that they’re hopeful. “We’re willing to work with people who have objections, and address their concerns, if it can be done in a way that doesn’t undermine the purpose and the basic framework of the legislation,” Thune told Recode in an interview. But even he acknowledged that the toughest roadblock of all might be Feinstein. “I don’t know if she’s asked for anything in particular; she just doesn’t like the bill,” he said of his Democratic colleague on Wednesday.

Artists kuromelon and redjuice have both recently posted their own respective videos of the Joy-Con in action as an art periphera, and yet another artist, Noxbat, created a helpful tutorial for those looking to try the clever setup out for themselves.  Any command that can be mapped to a Joy-Con can also be executed with a keyboard, but many digital artists work with setups where keyboards aren't as accessible. Drawing inputs like tablets and displays can take up a lot of space on a desk and they also tend to have just a few remappable buttons available at most. So who wants to fumble for hotkeys on a keyboard stuck off to the side, or navigate menus with a stylus? The Joy-Con's small size makes it easy to keep in whichever hand is free and with the help of JoyToKey can be mapped to suit the user's needs, extending the number of commands immediately at their fingertips and potentially speeding up workflow as a result.  Of course, pairing a Joy-Con to a PC doesn't keep it from working with the Switch. Unpairing it (or turning off Bluetooth temporarily while the Switch is in use) is enough to switch the Joy-Con from work back to play.  While digital artists are the ones running with this idea now, Joy-Con's could also be a boon for video editors, streamers, teachers, and anyone else who doesn't want to have to reach over and peck out the same half dozen commands on their keyboard all the time while they're knee-deep in something else.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgwz77/make-beautiful-art-with-a-switch-joy-con,Games,Vice
577,577,03-07-19 00:00,2019,7,3,MacDonald Dzirutwe,Premium prices attract small farmers back to coffee growing in Zimbabwe,"HONDE VALLEY, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - David Muganyura smells the coffee cherries on the slopes of his plot and breaks into a smile, as he chats to workers who are harvesting a crop he expects to be his biggest to date.  A long-time Zimbabwean coffee grower, Muganyura almost gave up on the crop when prices slumped to as low as U.S. 20 cents a pound at the turn of the millennium, and foreign buyers took flight after land seizures drove out more than 120 white commercial coffee farmers under the banner of post-colonial reform.  But with companies like Nestle’s Nespresso arm now willing to pay a premium for Zimbabwe’s beans, small-scale farmers like Muganyura are returning to a sector that was all-but destroyed under former President Robert Mugabe.  Coffee output in Zimbabwe was 430 tonnes in 2018, a 10% increase over the previous year. This year production is set at 500 tonnes, according to industry officials.  Zimbabwe was never among the world’s top producers: output peaked at around 15,000 tonnes in the late 1990s. But its Arabica coffee is prized for its zesty and fruity tones, and the sector once provided a livelihood for more than 20,000 poor farmers.  Nespresso, which started buying Zimbabwean coffee last year at a 30%-40% premium above international prices and pays farmers in U.S. dollars, is helping to drive the modest revival.  It bought 200 tonnes from 450 small Zimbabwean farmers and two large estates in 2018 and wants to attract more growers, said Daniel Weston, who heads Nespresso’s corporate affairs division.  Its limited edition “Tamuka muZimbabwe” (“We Have Awakened in Zimbabwe”) coffee, launched in 16 countries in May, sold out in three weeks, he said.  “What we are hoping to achieve over time is to increase the volume of coffee coming initially from the smallholder farmers we are working with and also to encourage other smallholder farmers to join the program,” Weston told Reuters.  Nespresso has teamed up with international non-profit Technoserve to offer training to small farmers in the growing techniques needed to achieve the high quality it demands.  “The market has a huge appetite for Zimbabwean coffee,” said Midway Bhunu, Technoserve’s farmer trainer. “The world was about to lose one of the world’s best coffees.”   Muganyura, a father of eight, received the training in 2017 and managed to more than triple output from his 2-hectare plot to 700 kg last year. This year, he expects to harvest 1.5 tonnes, a personal best that will earn him more than $10,000.  “This is only introductory to a stage where we will get real money,” Muganyura told Reuters during a visit to his plot in the eastern Honde Valley, about 360 km from the capital, Harare.  The dollar payments have enabled Muganyura to hire labor, install solar power at his homestead, buy farming inputs, pay school fees for some of his grand-children and medicine for his diabetic wife - which he struggled to do in the past.  This year, he aims to buy a car, a lifelong dream.  Because of his success, he said, neighbors are inquiring about growing coffee. He plans to add another half a hectare of coffee trees.  Zimbabwe outlawed the use of dollars and other foreign currencies last month, ending a decade of dollarization.   Nespresso said it was still assessing what that would mean for its dollar payments to farmers.  The Honde Valley is one of four districts that together had about 2,000 small coffee farmers at the turn of the millennium. But most quit and started growing bananas.   Just two white-owned commercial coffee farms remain in Zimbabwe. Robert Boswell, 50, owns one of them. His family lost two other farms to land seizures in 2000 and cut the area under coffee production by 46%.  Boswell said he felt more confident after President Emmerson Mnangagwa replaced Mugabe in 2017, promising to restore property rights and revive the ravaged economy.   Boswell, who had been selling coffee to roasters in Germany and Canada, started delivering to Nespresso in 2018. This year he will expand the area under coffee by 25% to 60 hectares, he said during a tour of his Crake Valley estate in the scenic Vumba hills, 140 km south of the Honde Valley.  Commercial growers have an average yield of more than 2 tonnes per hectare.  Tanganda Tea Company, owned by diversified group Meikles Limited, is Zimbabwe’s biggest coffee grower but its 134 hectares are a far cry from the more than 1,000 hectares it used to grow two decades ago.  Tanganda had largely abandoned coffee due to poor prices and started to grow avocados and macadamia nuts. But it too started selling to Nespresso in 2018 and plans to add another 40 hectares of coffee this year, according to a statement on its website.

Uptick was quick, too, with Microsoft noting 75 million installations by late August and 110 million installations by late October. The company's stated goal? To get to 1 billion installations by July 2018. One new change in how Microsoft distributes the upgrade may help the company reach that number—which in turn may have broader implications on how you use Windows. For users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, upgrading to Windows 10—Windows 10 is a free upgrade for these users, remember—is now considered ""recommended"" and no longer ""optional."" This isn't a mere change in terminology, since ""recommended"" updates are automatically downloaded (provided users' bandwidth settings are configured to enable automatic downloads) to help users install them quickly; an ""optional"" update would otherwise just sit in the Windows Update queue waiting for the user to initiate the download. In other words, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users who've put off upgrading to Windows 10 will now have to dive deep into their Windows Update settings to prevent the automatic download.  To be clear, Microsoft isn't so strident that it automatically installs Windows 10 onto PCs, but once automatically downloaded installing Windows 10 becomes a mere mouse click away. Microsoft encourages users to keep automatic updates turned on because that's how the company quickly rolls out patches and security updates, which are vital to keep PCs protected from malware and other nuisances that may affect Windows PCs. While there may be plenty of reasons for not wanting to upgrade to Windows 10, including the not insignificant task of having your already existing installation tweaked exactly to your liking, upgrading to Windows 10 signals to developers that Windows is a thriving platform that's worth their time. Without that, Windows merely becomes a commercial layer of software you use to run something like Chrome and Steam—apps you can run for free using Linux.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7yp7m/heres-why-microsoft-is-automatically-downloading-windows-10-onto-pcs,Tech by VICE,Vice

Meet Dufferin Starship, the Band Who Made an EP About Bunz Trading Zone","This article originally appeared on Noisey Canada. Toronto, though actually expansive, is often referred to as the ""biggest small town."" Now with the online bartering community Bunz Trading Zone, that feeling of closeness and community is further entrenched in city's social make-up. Bunz, formerly Bums, now commonly referred to as simply BTZ, began as a Facebook group dedicated to people trading unwanted items for something they do want. Trades for or including actual money are forbidden. Commonplace items include tall cans, tokens for transit, gift cards, and bottles of wine. These Torontonians have modest needs.  In the last year-and-a-half in particular, BTZ has exploded in popularity with over 58,000 members in its original group with spin-off, if you will, groups like Bunz Home Trading Zone, Bunz Dating Zone, and, a personal favourite, Bunz Pet Zone. BTZ has even gone north and reached Montreal. In homage to the connections, jokes, and trials of the group (think of the worst online comment threads and you'll likely find one in BTZ), we have Dufferin Starship. The band, its members only known by their first names, was formed by and write music about BTZ. Dufferin Starship, which is a name inspired by the insufferably Dufferin St. bus, have made a jangly pop-rock EP called Not In Service, which captures the breeziness of BTZ. ""Trade It All"" is the purest BTZ track of the bunch, detailing all the kinds of items for trade—skills, marijuana, CDs, half pack of smokes—with the lyric ""I'll trade it all to you/for a stick and poke tattoo."" Noisey spoke to the band via email about why the hell they decided to make an EP, let alone music, about the BTZ experience. Not In Service will be available Nov. 30 on the Bunz Trading Zone app and Bunz headquarters at 372 Richmond St. W tomorrow in exchange for a non-perishable food trade to the Parkdale Community Food Bank. Listen to the EP below and read our interview: Noisey: Can you take me through Dufferin Starship's origin story? Which thread or post did you all find yourselves on Bunz Trading Zone?Dufferin Starship: I posted my 1998 Stratocaster because I needed a new bike or set of bike wheels to finish another bike project so I could get around. I posted the guitar on Bunz and people were pretty interested. When I took the guitar over to this place, James and I realized we had met a couple times in the neighbourhood. He plugged it into his amp to test it and played a bit. We shot the shit. I was laughing about it because we were talking about Bunz and all the funny shit that goes on. A week later he reached out and had a demo of a song about Bunz. We were joking about that but I didn't think he would actually do it. It was basically a Bunz themed song and he had an idea about making a Bunz themed band. Anyway, it was funny and I liked it. So I started messing around and I wrote one too. Bobby wanted to record it so we went out to my friend Bradley's place and recorded it with our friends John and Tyler. We were having fun and it [set] off a spark in us.  The sound is distinctly a vintage pop and rock with sharp, quaint guitars. How does the content inform the sound?The whole concept for the band is Bunz. The funny stuff, the trades, the topics, and all the trolls. I mean it's all kind of kitschy and fun, it's not serious so we just did what we wanted. The sound is mostly an accident, we all wrote songs after we heard James' first one so we kind of all followed that lead, I guess. Our vibe was really light and fun, we wanted the music to reflect that. Does BTZ proper have much influence on the group or what music you make?It's funny, because when we started getting this going we realized we all have lots of mutual friends. Bobby is friends with Morty from Bunz. Morty was laughing his ass off when we played him the first song and instantly wanted to help out. His idea was to make it a trade-based album where people could only get it if they traded a food item in support for the Parkdale Community Food Bank. That made sense to us because we aren't trying to make money off this and it's a real Bunz move to use it for charity. Would you consider doing an EP for every BTZ offshoot group? I'm looking at Bunz Dating Zone or maybe Bunz Pet Zone.Oh god. It was such a funny thing that we haven't even really thought about the next steps or anything. How many of you take the Dufferin bus on the regular and how infuriating do you find it?Oh, we have ALL taken the Dufferin Bus so many times. You enter the 29 bus a regular everyday person, get projected into the Dufferin realm and it may or may not transform you into your own bizarro starship character eating generic brand Cheesies from a fedora.

581,581,28-05-18 00:00,2018,5,28,"Sam Aung Moon, Yimou Lee",Myanmar police witness says searched Reuters reporters' phones without warrant,"YANGON (Reuters) - Police in Myanmar examined the mobile phones of two Reuters reporters accused of possessing secret documents without a search warrant after their arrests in December, an officer told a court on Monday, in what has become a landmark press freedom case.  Prosecution witness Major Aung Kyaw San said police did not have a warrant to search the phones because the reporters were accused under the Official Secrets Act, which gave officers the power to make arrests and begin an investigation without needing prior permission from a court.  That assertion was disputed by defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw, who told Reuters after the hearing that only the arrests were allowed before seeking the approval of a judge. “This is not acceptable,” he said. “Regarding (obtaining) evidence, a warrant is needed.”  (Follow latest updates on detained reporters here)  Lead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung declined to comment.  Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment. Previously, he has declined to discuss details of the proceedings or the police investigation, saying Myanmar’s courts were independent.  The court in Yangon has been holding hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 32, and his Reuters colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.  Judge Ye Lwin last week accepted as evidence printed copies of documents that Major Aung Kyaw San, a police IT expert, said were found on the reporters’ phones. The documents included alleged confidential government letters and plans for the development of an island off Myanmar’s west coast for tourism.  Defense lawyers had argued the documents should not be admitted as evidence because it was unclear who had access to the phones after the reporters’ arrests on Dec. 12, and that the prosecution did not explain how the 21 documents were relevant to the case.  Some of the documents came from the Facebook Messenger app, the defense said, and it was not clear the reporters themselves had accessed them.  “We don’t know anything about the documents they said they found in our phones,” Wa Lone told reporters after Monday’s hearing. “The documents can be sent automatically to Messenger.”   At the time of their arrests, the reporters had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state. The killings took place during a military crackdown that United Nations agencies say sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.  The reporters have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers at a restaurant in northern Yangon by two policemen they had not met before, having been invited to meet the officers for dinner.  Last month, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing testified that a senior officer had ordered his subordinates to plant secret documents on Wa Lone to “trap” the reporter.  At a news conference on May 15, Police Director General Aung Win Oo dismissed the testimony as untruthful.  After his court appearance, Moe Yan Naing was sentenced to a year in jail for violating police discipline and his family was evicted from police housing. Police have said the eviction and his sentencing were not related to his testimony, but have declined to elaborate further.  Global advocates for press freedom, human rights activists, as well the United Nations and several Western countries, have called for the release of the Reuters journalists.   On Monday, diplomats from France, Denmark and the European Union - as well as others - observed the proceedings.  The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday.

582,582,30-10-18 00:00,2018,10,30,"Fathin Ungku, Yuddy Cahya","Indonesian divers, 'pinger locators', hunt for doomed plane's cockpit recorders","JAVA SEA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia deployed divers on Tuesday to search for an airliner that crashed with 189 people on board, as “pinger locators” tried to zero in on its cockpit recorders and find out why an almost-new plane went down in the sea minutes after take-off.  Indonesia, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, has a patchy safety record. With the now almost certain prospect of all on board having died, the crash is set to rank as its second-worst air disaster.  (Graphic: Indonesian plane crash - tmsnrt.rs/2OZPYBz)  Ground staff lost contact with flight JT610 of budget airline Lion Air 13 minutes after the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft took off early on Monday from the airport in Jakarta, the capital, on its way to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.  Dozens of relatives of those on board gathered at a police hospital where body bags were brought for forensic doctors to try to identify victims, including by taking saliva swabs from family members for DNA tests.  “I keep praying for a miracle although logically, the plane has sunk in the ocean,” said Toni Priyono Adhi, whose daughter was on the flight.  “But as a parent, I want a miracle.”  A Reuters witness on a boat at the crash site saw about 60 divers scattered in inflatable boats over the slightly choppy waters entering the sea, which is about 35 metres (115 feet) deep.  Sonar vessels and an underwater drone have also been hunting for the wreckage of the fuselage, where many victims were feared trapped, officials said.  The head of a national transport safety panel, Soerjanto Tjahjono, said that underwater “pinger locators”, including equipment from Singapore, were being deployed to help find the aircraft’s black boxes.  The priority is finding the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to help determine the cause of the disaster, safety experts said.  “The visibility is not good as it’s very overcast,” a special forces officer said.  Underwater footage released by the national search and rescue agency showed relatively poor visibility. In all, 35 vessels are helping to search.  The focus was initially an area within 5 nautical miles of where the plane lost contact, but that was expanded to 10 nautical miles on Tuesday and will be expanded to 15 on Wednesday, a search and rescue agency officer said.  But only debris, personal items, including 52 identification cards and passports, and body parts have been found off the shore of Karawang district, east of Jakarta.   Police said human remains were collected in 37 body bags after sweeps of the site, roughly 15 km (nine miles) off the coast.  Most of those on board were Indonesian but the airline has said an Italian passenger and Indian pilot were on the plane.  The pilot of flight JT610 had asked to return to base shortly after it took off, at about 6.20 a.m. on Monday. Investigators are trying to determine why the pilot issued the request, which was granted.  The deputy of the national transportation safety committee told a news conference the plane had technical problems on its previous flight, from the city of Denpasar on Bali island on Sunday, including an issue over “unreliable airspeed”.  “We are also asking for information from the last pilot who flew from Denpasar to Jakarta, but we have not met the technician,” Haryo Satmiko said, referring to the technician who handled the aircraft after it landed on Sunday.  The committee also had a recording of the conversation between the pilot of JT610 before it crashed and the control tower at Jakarta, he said.  Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi told reporters at Jakarta’s dock that the investigation would result in sanctions being handed out, but he did not elaborate.  Lion had operated 11 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and a transport ministry official said inspections would be made on all of those models operating in Indonesia though they would not be grounded.  On Monday, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing Co (BA.N) said they were providing assistance for the investigation.  The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer’s workhorse single-aisle jet.  Two witnesses described the plane as swaying or rocking as it came down, adding that the nose hit the water first and there was a tall column of smoke afterwards.    The aircraft did not make a noise when it came down, they said.  “From a long way off, it was already leaning,” said Gauk, a fisherman who uses one name.  Privately owned Lion Air, founded in 1999, said the aircraft, which had been in operation since August, was airworthy, with its pilot and co-pilot together having amassed 11,000 hours of flying time.  Indonesia’s worst air disaster was in 1997, when a Garuda Indonesia A300 crashed in the city of Medan, killing 234 people.

MJ's two slots in the HOF will stay put and won't be removed or altered in any way ... despite the allegations made in HBO's doc about the singer. The reason is simple ... according to an HOF official -- music is music is music. HOF honchos say Jackson, as with all of its inductees, was recognized for musical excellence and talent, along with having a lasting impact on rock 'n' roll. In other words, MJ changed music, like, forever. What's more ... Michael was voted into the Hall (twice) by a voting body of historians, fellow musicians, and music industry professionals. He got in with the Jackson 5 in 1997, and again as a solo artist in 2001, when 'NSYNC inducted him. As for whether his HOF exhibit might be changed at all -- possibly even removing memorabilia -- our HOF sources say it all stays the same. It's interesting ... a children's museum in Indianapolis recently removed three pieces of MJ memorabilia items in the wake of Wade Robson and James Safechuck's claims. Not in Cleveland, though. Once a HOFer, always a HOFer ... or so it seems. In fact, Michael could come up again at this year's HOF induction.

585,585,27-04-16 13:30,2016,4,27,Chavie Lieber,Teatox Party,"Jillian Trigg, a nutritionist from Vancouver, joined Instagram in April of 2012. She had struggled with an eating disorder as a teenager, and was now turning to social media as a source of inspiration and comfort. She posted fitness photos, protein bar recipes, and other health-related images. A few months later, requests for sponsored posts from brands of all kinds began to trickle in. Among those getting in touch with Trigg were companies that sold tea promising to detoxify your body; they were called teatoxes. First, brands reached out through email, and then through Instagram itself, once direct messaging was introduced. ""The emails all kind of read the same,"" says Trigg. ""It was something like, ‘Hey, we noticed you're in good shape and we think you'd be a great promoter for our brand. Here's a link to our tea website, let us know if you'd like to post.'"" Trigg was initially intrigued. She was already an ambassador for Viva Health, a Vancouver-based natural skincare line, and AboutTime, which sells protein powder — brands whose products she could get behind. But after going to the teatox companies' websites, she found little information about the teas themselves. Instead, she saw photo after photo of ""girls who fit the criteria of being young, good-looking, and in shape, holding the tea."" Trigg declined the various requests from the tea brands, but many, many others have not. If you spend any time scrolling through Instagram, odds are you've seen teatox posts, whether they be from that hot trainer at your gym, the beauty blogger you know from YouTube, or the random girl you went to high school with who somehow managed to rack up an impressive social media following. Then there are the actual celebrities, from A-list to D-list, that promote them. Nicki Minaj and Britney Spears are on the teatox train, as are Hilary Duff, Coco, Lea Michele, and Amber Rose. A good portion of the Kardashian-Jenner clan promotes these brands: Kylie, Khloe, Kourtney, Scott. Celebrities looking to get back in the spotlight and/or make a quick buck like Snooki and Lindsay Lohan shill for tea. So do social media stars like Brock O'Hurn and those in the Bachelor universe like Andi Dorfman. The teatox industry is enormous, with hundreds of brands from all over the world selling their products — and paying as much as a quarter of a million dollars per post to get the influencer seal of approval. In fact, promoting teatoxes has become one of the fastest growing businesses on Instagram. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly was the original teatox brand, but the companies in play today are all remarkably similar. A simple search on Instagram will bring you to Lyfe Tea, Fit Tea, Skinny Bunny Tea, SkinnyMint, TinyTea Teatox, Flat Tummy Tea, ShowGirlSlim, Baetea, Naked Me Tea, and My Beauty Tea. The list goes on. Most of them are mysteriously operated, with no discernable press representation or even employees made available to answer questions. Some you can place geographically: Teami Blends from Florida, Bootea from England, Skinny Teatox from Canada, SkinnyMe Tea from Australia, TeaTox Me from Russia, Teatox & Co. from Indonesia. These brands promise the tea ""promotes fat burning,"" ""reduces bloating,"" ""makes you feel light,"" and ""cleans the digestive system."" In other words: these teas act as laxatives. All of these brands more or less sell the exact same product: tea that comes in colorful pouches and breaks down into two categories, morning tea (the ""skinny"" tea) and evening tea (the ""detoxifying"" tea). The ingredients are essentially the same, regardless of brand — some combination of green, chamomile, and peppermint tea leaves; licorice, dandelion, rhubarb, ginger, and ginseng roots; and cloves, cinnamon bark, and dried goji berries. A 14-day starter pack usually sells for around $30, a 28-day pack for about $55, and a deluxe combination pack somewhere between $100 and $120. On the packaging, these brands promise the tea ""promotes fat burning,"" ""reduces bloating,"" ""makes you feel light,"" and ""cleans the digestive system."" In other words: these teas act as laxatives. The primary ingredient in nearly every single evening ""detoxifying"" tea is senna, an FDA-approved plant found in Ex-Lax and a number of its stimulant laxative competitors. Some teatox brands offer full disclosure about senna and its effects. Others don't list ingredients or make them a little bit harder to find, requiring consumers to do their homework. Those that are more upfront explain you could experience ""a churning tummy"" that will require you to ""visit the bathroom more often,"" but they're also quick to assure customers that you should ""not experience diarrhea"" — even though many do attest to this side effect. ""I am in mortal fear that I am possibly going to shit my pants,"" Megan Reynolds wrote in a story about using Skinny Teatox for Racked last year. While senna isn't necessarily harmful for one-off use, health experts say it's not a substance people should be consuming on a regular basis, let alone for two weeks straight as an attempt to drop a few pounds. ""It can cause cramping, indigestion, dehydration, and is also just not particularly pleasant,"" says Scott Gavura, an Ontario-based pharmacist and writer at the medical watchdog site Science-Based Medicine. ""Taking a laxative when you think you're bloated or overweight is not something you want to do from a medical perspective. That's not healthy to yourself, and if you take it for a long period of time, it can be disruptive for your digestion and to the bacterial flora in your colon."" A product like a teatox is ""problematic because it's not science-based,"" says Jim White, a registered dietician with the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics. ""It also promises quick fixes, which is what worries me."" As the Guardian noted in a much-shared piece about the myth of the ""detox,"" so-called detoxification is just a ""pseudo-medical concept designed to sell you things."" ""The healthy body has kidneys, a liver, skin, even lungs that are detoxifying as we speak. There is no known way — certainly not through detox treatments — to make something that works perfectly well in a healthy body work better,"" Edzard Ernst, an academic physician, told the newspaper. He called products that promise to detoxify your body ""a criminal exploitation of the gullible man on the street."" Teatoxes, like all dietary supplements sold in this country, are not formally regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA's Lyndsay Meyer says that while these brands are required to register with the agency, they are only expected to self-determine if their product is safe, as per the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; this means companies do all of their own testing, without any regulation or input from the FDA. The law also does not give the FDA the power to pre-approve products before they go on sale. Meyer says the the FDA is well aware of these teatox companies, and Federal Trade Commission attorney Michael Ostheimer says that 21 cases involving dietary supplements were brought by the FTC over the last few years, though he would not disclose any further information, including how many of those cases related to teatoxes specifically. Teatox reviews are all over the internet, and many of them are positive. Those on Amazon have customers raving they ""lost 3 lbs after only 4 days of taking this product every morning""; people claim they have ""a lot more energy than I usually do"" and that their ""bloating went down as well."" But you can also find plenty of complaints that label teatoxes as a scam, as well as accounts of the teas messing with menstrual cycles and affecting the efficacy of birth control. However, because few people actually file official reports with the FDA, choosing instead to contact companies directly or post comments online, Meyer says there is little the FDA can do. ""Unless there's a safety signal, there's no reason for us to take action,"" she explains. ""Which is why we tell people, ‘If you think you've been harmed, you need to report to us and not only to the manufacturer,' because teatox companies don't have to let us know what adverse events are happening. Unless people are dying, they don't have to tell us about complaints they are receiving."" Brands often post before-and-after weight loss transformation photos on their own sites and social media accounts, and according to Trigg, many of these photos are stolen from Instagram users who participate in fitness communities on the platform, like Kayla's Army. Even when they aren't grabbing photos from other sources, brands will also post their own weight loss photos and credit the progress solely to their teas, when in fact many of these customers use the product in conjunction with diet and exercise. ""Tea is not evil. Telling girls they will lose 15 pounds by going on a teatox, that is evil,"" Trigg says. ""I work with some clients who are young girls and when they say they want to take a teatox because they feel bloated, I have to explain that it's not actually going to ‘detoxify' them and that these companies are just devaluing hard work."" Emma Richards, a 28-year-old from Waterloo, Canada, is the founder of Skinny Teatox and the only representative from a teatox brand willing to go on the record for this story. She says she started her company in early 2013 after seeing ""a few big teatox companies overseas, like Bootea, MateFit, and FitTea, gaining some attention on social media."" ""I ordered a few, and shipping took literally three weeks to a month-and-a-half, and then I had to pay customs to receive the shipment,"" Richards writes over email. ""I thought, ‘Well, that's ridiculous,' so we started a North American-based company to serve these markets with better service and shipping times. There are hundreds — god, maybe thousands now — of different teatox companies around the world, the vast majority of which are independently owned."" ""There are hundreds — god, maybe thousands now — of different teatox companies around the world, the vast majority of which are independently owned."" There are countless copycat brands, and all of their websites look almost exactly the same; every one of the at least 30 teatox sites investigated for this story is powered by Shopify, a Canada-based e-commerce platform. Brandon Chu, a senior product manager at the company, would not disclose how many tea businesses his company works with, but says Shopify has seen ""a lot of growth with teatox."" He is similarly vague when addressing the question of whether the brands first came to Shopify or if Shopify sought them out, saying it ""was a little bit of both."" Part of the strategy involves gaming SEO; when you Google ""sell tea online,"" a Shopify link is one of the first results to show up. Skinny Teatox operates via Shopify, and though Richards wouldn't share sales figures for her company, she says selling teatoxes is a ""profitable business"" and claims Skinny Teatox is ""the leading teatox company in North America."" (She also operates the brand OMG Waist Trainers; waist trainers, as well as teeth whitening systems, are among the most wildly popular products to promote on Instagram.) Richards adds that the largest markets for her teatox company are LA and Miami, and that Instagram has been integral to her success. Instagram was the perfect place for the teatox industry to flourish, explains Thomas Rankin, the CEO of Dash Hudson, a company that helps brands grow their followings and monetize on the platform. ""There were people early on that realized it was a visual channel, where you could take a visual product and get it in front of a big audience for next to nothing,"" says Rankin, ""and these tea brands were one of the first to do it."" A weight loss product marketed by a woman in a bikini is an easy win. ""Everything has shifted,"" adds Matt Britton, chairman of Talent Resources, a marketing and entertainment company that works with digital influencers. ""Consumers are not watching shows on TV but streaming them, and when they listen to music, it's not on the radio but with Pandora or Spotify, so the mediums people used to spend their money on are waning in influence. This generation is glued to their phones, so this is obviously the place where companies can get eyeballs and attention."" Two and a half years ago, the St. Louis-based MateFit paid Instagram fitness star Jen Selter to post of a photo of herself with its products. Back then, Selter had around 1.3 million followers; she now has 9 million, thanks to her famous ""belfies"". MateFit decided she should be their first big-name Insta-spokesperson, and the company went through Talent Resources to make it happen. Yehuda Neuman, the company's director of brand relations, says that MateFit set the bar for celebrity teatox endorsements. ""That killed the Instagram marketing game because at the time, there were no competing tea brands working with celebrities, and so they were able to explode,"" Neuman explains. ""That kicked everything off."" Since Selter's first Instagram post, Talent Resources has brokered hundreds of deals between teatox companies and celebrities on social media, working with clients like Bootea, FitTea, and MateFit. Neuman says that when it comes to celebrity buzz, the baton has been passed from MateFit to FitTea, a Florida-based brand that's partnered with the Kardashian family. While some celebrities are eager to promote teatoxes on Instagram, Neuman says others only post as part of a package deal that also involves more traditional product placement. In the case of Nicki Minaj's ""Anaconda,"" Britney Spears and Iggy Azalea's ""Pretty Girls,"" and Big Sean's ""I Don't Fuck With You,"" Instagram posts were added as a contractual requirement when MateFit paid for its tea to be featured in the music videos. ""Studios aren't funding videos the way they used to. Artists are now funding them, so at the end of the day, they need the money,"" says Neuman. ""Product placement makes or breaks it, so they take the Instagram deal."" Neuman says plenty of talent reps for big stars have turned him down, and that Minaj insisted on tasting the tea before agreeing to any sort of deal. But Britton points out that a partnership with a teatox brand is hard to say no to because posting is ""literally no work."" ""These deals are like one-night stands,"" Britton says. ""They aren't like the endorsements Katy Perry does with Popchips — they are transactional. Celebrities take them because it's not like doing a long shoot for a magazine, or having to travel for a gig. It requires, like, 10 seconds."" Some agreements even allow the influencer to delete the post a few days later — it's called a ""deletion clause"" — which is why you won't find live product posts on the Instagram accounts of Kim Kardashian or Scott Disick. Some agreements even allow the influencer to delete the post a few days later — it's called a ""deletion clause"" — which is why you won't find live product posts on the Instagram accounts of Kim Kardashian or Scott Disick. You can still find these posts via Google Image, though. Mike Heller, Talent Resources' CEO, says the pay scale for teatox Instagram posts he places starts at $3,000 and goes all the way up to $250,000. The amount you get paid depends on your follower count, and while Heller wouldn't confirm which celebrities are getting paid a quarter of a million dollars per post, it's fair to assume someone like Kylie Jenner, with her 59 million followers, is among the highest-paid celebrity endorsers. Yes, it seems inconceivable that teatox brands are able to shell out this kind of cash to influencers. Heller notes, though, that the costs these companies incur are very low. Bundles of loose tea leaves and dried bark are cheap to buy, especially in bulk, and these brands turn around and sell their products at ten times the cost. With such high margins, Heller explains, ""they can spend all of their money using digital and social media to amplify and get their message out there."" Neuman adds that ""these are small businesses that have a lot of flexibility; they don't have the corporate structures, so there's more opportunity to have target investments."" Richards says Skinny Teatox only has a team of ""three to four,"" which means very little overhead. And pay-for-play does help these businesses. According to data provided to Racked by Dash Hudson, a FitTea Instagram post from Kylie Jenner on March 28th performed worse than average, with an engagement rate (likes and comments in relation to follower count) of 1.3 percent as opposed to her normal 2 percent. Still, the photo exposed the brand to her 59 million followers and gained FitTea nearly 3,000 new followers of its own. Plus, Neuman says his team's research has found that teatox companies see an unusually high number of repeat buyers, so every potential new customer is a potential longtime customer. In addition to tea companies spending money to work with celebrities, they reach out to smaller-scale influencers of all types. Many teatox brands start out by contacting small-time bloggers and lesser-known models. Once a brand gains enough name recognition and sells enough product, they can broker deals with stars who have higher price tags. Claire Felske, a 24-year-old model and actress living in LA, says companies she's been in contact with typically pay $3,000 per one million Instagram followers. Last year, Felske worked with a teatox company called Teami Blends. After dating Vine star Curtis Lepore, Felske developed a nice-but-modest following of around 45,000 followers. She was initially offered $700 for three Instagram posts, followed by $600 for two; Lepore, she says, was getting something like $6,000 per post because he had 2 million Instagram followers. Some brands have found their own niches when it comes to lower-profile endorsers. According to the Dash Hudson data, teatox brand Skinny Bunny Tea has the best results when it works with Eastern European models; its top influencer is Russian model Mirgaeva Galinka. Bootea's posts are most successful when the Instagrammer is male, and since it is a British company, you'll find more ""foppish emo images than dudes with six packs,"" says Rankin. Skinny Teatox generally aligns with food and lifestyle bloggers, with its top influencer being French food blogger Coralie Bancal of @cocohealthyflorist. Tea companies often use hashtags to identify tight-knit communities on Instagram, and determine which groups to target and who within those groups to work with. They look to every corner of the platform to seek out fit models, Australian surfer babes, and more. Neuman says that once deals are inked, brands study engagement levels to decide who is worth developing long-term relationships with, keeping a close eye on if accounts have bought followers: ""We'll test five people from the same demographic and then build from there. It's market research."" This is likely how Teami Blends discovered Latiffa Cisero, a 37-year-old government intelligence officer from Northern Virginia who is a natural hair blogger and model on the side. ""They had to have found me through my natural hair hashtags,"" Cisero says of Teami. ""I'm assuming they were looking for natural girls because I've seen other girls with natural hair like me posting Teami. Someone from their marketing must have been told to go after the natural hair world."" Tea companies often use hashtags to identify tight-knit communities on Instagram, and determine which groups to target and who within those groups to work with. Cisero is sent photos from Teami that she can put on her Instagram if she chooses, though she prefers to take her own. She also gets regular email updates from the company reminding her when it's time to post. (In the case of both Cisero and Felske, the emails come from a woman named Jennyris, who did not respond to any communication from Racked.) Cisero doesn't get paid by Teami Blends, but instead struck a deal where she gets free tea in exchange for her posts. This is in fact the case for many teatox ambassadors that were interviewed for this story but did not wish to be quoted, for fear of losing their partnerships. The appeal is not necessarily getting freebies as much as it is appearing to be big enough to post sponsored content. These would-be social media stars hope their gratis teatox posts will trigger other brands, those who will offer money and help seriously kickstart their Instagram careers, to get in touch. It's also about gaining followers. Many brands will regram influencers, and so posting a picture of a teatox product and using the proper hashtags can lead to an increased following of your own. With so many Instagrammers teaming up with teatox companies, Dash Hudson's Rankin says the space has turned into something of a circus. ""It's a race to scale,"" he explains. ""We are waiting to see who will spend the most money on influencers so they can become the number one tea."" Chavie Lieber is a senior reporter at Racked.

In a move that prosecutors and legal experts believe to be entirely unheard-of, Cohen wants his counsel to review the materials the FBI seized from his home, office, and hotel room earlier this week as part of a criminal investigation into his business dealings. The FBI was reportedly seeking information on Trump’s ""Access Hollywood"" tape and payments to Stormy Daniels. Cohen then wants his attorneys to re-release the documents they see as “responsive, non-privileged items” back to prosecutors.    READ:   Trump and Cohen want their lawyer on the “taint team” screening raided documents Federal prosecutors for the Office of the Southern District of New York who are overseeing the investigation called that request “extraordinary” in court documents on Friday. They cheekily noted Cohen would need to create a new law that converts a search warrant, which allows law enforcement to take what they want, into a subpoena, which places the burden to turn over documents on the recipient.  A federal magistrate judge, however, granted the FBI a search warrant because she believed they would probably find evidence of a crime.

They cheekily noted Cohen would need to create a new law that converts a search warrant, which allows law enforcement to take what they want, into a subpoena, which places the burden to turn over documents on the recipient.  A federal magistrate judge, however, granted the FBI a search warrant because she believed they would probably find evidence of a crime. “Cohen advances the novel proposition, without any precedent or legal basis, that Cohen’s own counsel should undertake the initial review of the returns of lawfully executed search warrants,” the federal prosecutors wrote. “The USAO [U.S. Attorney’s Office] is aware of no precedent for such an unconventional practice.” “You could imagine there are a lot of drug dealers in the south side of Chicago who would love to have that right. But that’s not how it works.” “This Court should not accept Cohen’s invitation to make new law and convert a duly authorized search warrant into a subpoena,” they continued.  For Cohen to pick and choose what materials his team sees as “responsive” to the search warrant would allow him to essentially dictate the investigation, according to former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti.  “You could imagine there are a lot of drug dealers in the south side of Chicago who would love to have that right,” Mariotti said. “But that’s not how it works.” He added there was virtually no chance a judge would accept Cohen's request.  For his part, Cohen claims the prosecutors’ search was overbroad and that the government seized “thousands and thousands of privileged documents” his team should be able to review.  But federal prosecutors have incessantly dismissed that theory and said they found close to no evidence that Cohen did enough legal to work to produce the volume of paperwork Cohen claims. They’ve also implemented a third-party “filter team” or “taint team” to analyze and exclude privileged documents from being shared with investigators.  “The results of that review, as reported by the USAO’s Filter Team, indicate that Cohen is in fact performing little to no legal work, and that zero emails were exchanged with President Trump,” prosecutors wrote in Friday’s filing.

588,588,11-06-19 00:00,2019,6,11,Ernest Scheyder,Albemarle declines to participate in LME lithium contract,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, the world’s largest lithium producer, said on Tuesday it will not participate in the London Metal Exchange’s plan to launch a new contract for the white metal, depriving it of a key source of pricing data.  The move reflects a view by some that lithium, used to make electric car batteries, is a specialty chemical rather than a basic commodity, and should be priced on a contract-by-contract basis.  “An exchange contract tends to support a commodity market, and that’s not what we believe this (lithium market) is,” David Ryan, Albemarle’s head of corporate strategy and investor relations, told the Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Markets Conference in Santiago.  The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, on Monday chose Fastmarkets to provide a reference price for the contract.  “At this point our intent is that we will not be providing price information to the index,” said Ryan.  The LME said in a statement to Reuters that it respects the right of companies to operate in whatever ways best suit their needs.  “The LME continues to work with a supportive group of industry participants to develop solutions for the lithium industry, and will launch a contract when those participants are ready to use it,” spokeswoman Bianca Blake said  Unlike for copper or other metals used to make electric cars, there has not been a traded price for lithium, leaving the industry’s investors, customers, analysts and executives without a full sense of the global market.  Ryan spoke on a panel presentation alongside executives from rivals SQM and Tianqi Lithium Corp, which agreed that lithium is not a true commodity.  “The challenge of the index is to try to have very good representation of the market, which I really feel is not possible today because of how the lithium industry works,” Pablo Altimiras, SQM’s vice president of lithium and iodine, told the conference.  An SQM spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Tuesday when asked after Altimiras spoke if the Chilean company plans to participate in the LME contract.    Tianqi President Vivian Wu had said on Monday that the contract is “going to be helpful for us” and should bring more clarity to the market.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle operates across Chile, Australia and the United States, providing lithium used by Panasonic Corp to make batteries for Tesla Inc and other electric automakers.  The company sells nearly all its lithium on long-term contracts, not spot deals, which would be the most influenced by a LME lithium price.   Many long-term supply contracts are already referencing an LME price, an anticipatory step designed to set future deal parameters, industry investors have told Reuters.

589,589,04-04-17 23:15,2017,4,4,Peter Kafka,Amazon will stream Thursday night NFL games this year,"Last year, the National Football League experimented by letting Twitter livestream 10 Thursday night games. This year, pro football will continue the test, but will switch it up: Amazon has bought the rights to the league’s streaming package, and will offer the games for free to its Amazon Prime subscribers around the world. Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube had also expressed interest in carrying the games this year. Amazon is paying around $50 million for the 10 games it will show next fall, according to a person familiar with the deal. That’s a big increase from the $10 million Twitter paid for last year’s games. The rest of the deal is roughly similar to the one Twitter had last year: CBS and NBC will each broadcast five games, and Amazon will stream the networks’ coverage, including their ads. Amazon will have the rights to sell a handful of ad slots per game. Amazon says it may sell ads for those slots, but says it will also use them to promote the company’s other video offerings. Amazon won’t have exclusive streaming rights for the games. CBS and NBC will also have the ability to stream the games they broadcast, and Verizon will stream the games to its wireless subscribers. The deal is Amazon’s first significant foray into livestreaming (besides Twitch, the live video game streaming platform it bought a few years ago), and its first major move into sports; Amazon has also worked with the NFL on “All or Nothing,” a behind-the-scenes documentary series that debuted last summer. But Amazon has been ramping up its interest in live sports. “For us, this is about starting to bring live sports to our Prime members all around the world,” said Jeff Blackburn, the company’s head of business development and entertainment. Last year, when Twitter beat out Amazon for the NFL games, both Twitter and the NFL made a big deal about the fact that Twitter had around 300 million users worldwide. And they said Twitter could reach even more people with NFL games, because it wouldn’t require anyone to log in to Twitter to watch them. This year, the NFL seems to have made a different calculation. By putting it behind its Amazon Prime paywall, Amazon will reach a smaller potential audience. Amazon has never disclosed its Prime subscriber numbers, but my colleague Jason Del Rey thinks the company has 66 million subscribers; some Wall Street analysts think the number is higher. But Brian Rolapp, the NFL executive in charge of the league’s media deals, argues that Amazon should be able to find at least as many viewers as Twitter did, since Amazon Prime members visit and use Amazon a lot. “Reach is a focus of ours. I think Amazon has been able to demonstrate, in everything that they do, massive scale,” he said. “I don’t think this is limiting the reach. I think this is expanding the reach.” It’s unclear what benefit streaming the games actually provides for a digital platform. Last year, both Twitter and the NFL said they were pleased with the results of the experiment, but the games didn’t generate a huge audience: They averaged less than 300,000 viewers per minute, while CBS and NBC averaged 15.8 million viewers.

590,590,20-07-18 17:30,2018,7,20,Alex Robert Ross,Del The Funky Homosapien Discusses His Near-Fatal Fall and Painful Recovery,"Del The Funky Homosapien fractured seven ribs, one of which punctured a lung, after falling from the stage during Gorillaz' headline set at Roskilde Festival in Denmark on July 7. Since then the 45-year-old rapper, born Teren Jones, has undergone surgery and been released from hospital. He's spent the past five days holed up in a nearby hotel room, watching battle rap videos, playing Nintendo, and trying to type up lyrics. He's on a steady diet of morphine, and he can't reduce his dose. ""I kind of let them wear off for a minute to see what it really was like,"" he says over the phone. ""It was unbearable."" Despite the painkillers and the trauma, Jones remembers the incident clearly. He'd only played two dates with Gorillaz in Europe on this run before the show in Denmark, and he'd been asleep since arriving in Roskilde. He woke up shortly before his set. It was night time, there was a smoke machine, and he was wearing sunglasses. He wasn't aware that there was a platform jutting out from the middle of the stage, so he came out for his first verse on ""Clint Eastwood"" as he usually does, ran past the band's frontman Damon Albarn, and barely got his first bar out before he fell off the side. ""And then I was on the ground, crumpled up, crying, looking up into the lights and shit,"" he says. ""Just crying, begging for help, in extreme pain. Damon I think tried to reach his hand down toward me [but] I couldn't move. I thought I was gonna die, basically."" He was rushed straight to hospital, where Denmark's socialized healthcare system took over. ""I will say that Denmark, their medical system, they was on it,"" he says. ""If it was any other place, like the United States, I'm dead now."" He had an epidural so that doctors could pump morphine directly into his veins, and a cannula to help him breathe. Doctors explained everything to him, but it was gory nonetheless: ""They had to do surgery and had a tube directly in my lung. So the dude was pumping blood and air out of my lung. I had like four or five tubes hooked up to me."" After successful surgery, all that Jones can do now is rest. Domino, the producer and a fellow member of underground hip-hop group Hieroglyphics, helps him out and brings him food. Jones is trying to type up lyrics when he gets the chance, and he's not passing out from the morphine now that his body's worked up a resistance. Still, he's in pain, and he's frustrated. Someone should have warned him about the setup on stage, he says: ""If there's a danger of any sort, somebody would usually tell me. I had been asleep the whole time I was there. I went straight to the dressing room and just laid on the couch and went to sleep. I was exhausted. So when I woke up, they let me know it's time to go on, I went to the stage, they handed me a mic[...] I don't know. All I know is it wasn't my fault. I ran out there thinking everything was cool, and all of a sudden it wasn't cool no more."" He'd usually be out skateboarding, but that's out of the question for a long time. His new album,  Gate 13, a brilliantly minimal and dextrous collaboration with producer Amp Live, only came out in April, but Jones has had to cancel the rest of his tour dates for the year. Doctors told him the recovery would take roughly three months, but he doesn't think that will be the end of things: ""I would imagine I'm probably going to be handicapped to some degree. I find it hard to believe that I'm going to be restored back to 100 percent after this. That just doesn't make any sense. Even if you repair something that you owned, it might work, but it ain't like when you first bought it out the store. That just seems ridiculous to me."" He smashed his elbow on tour with Hieroglyphics a few years ago, pushing things too far on a playground swing. The bone recovered, but it still bugs him occasionally. It's understandably difficult for him to see how he'll bounce back perfectly from a busted chest.  But the lyrics he's writing in between those YouTube videos and Nintendo interludes are still funny, he says.  Gate 13 is packed with crisp one-liners—something he prides himself on coming from the battle rap scene—and he's not losing it now. ""You can take things like that and find a way to express them,"" he says. ""That's really all it is. Humor is just a socially acceptable way of saying things that you might not be able to say without disturbing people otherwise. So I naturally have a good sense of humor I guess, otherwise I'd be probably bouncing off the walls or arrested."" There's nothing anyone can do to help (the Danish healthcare system, again, makes that simpler) but Jones says the messages he's received so far have been invaluable. He'd been thinking about dropping live shows altogether, having lost faith in the industry after the fall. ""And then I feel like, if I'd have died, people would have just gone on, making money off of my death as well,"" he says, morbidly. But the support he's got so far has kept him from dropping out. ""The one reason why I would want to still perform is because of the fans. So it's very encouraging and reassuring to see that so many people care about how I'm doing.""

591,591,30-03-19 00:00,2019,3,30,Letitia Stein,Ex-vice president Biden doesn't recall inappropriate kiss alleged by activist: spokesman,"(Reuters) - A spokesman for Joe Biden said the former vice president does not recall an incident in 2014 when a female activist said he inappropriately kissed her, but some of his potential rivals for the Democratic nomination said on Saturday they believe his accuser.  The allegation was made in an online essay published on Friday by Lucy Flores, a party activist who was running to be Nevada’s lieutenant governor. Flores said Biden also touched her shoulders and smelled her hair when they appeared at an event together, making her feel uncomfortable.  “He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head,” Flores wrote in the essay published in The Cut, an outlet of New York Magazine. “I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me.”  Responding to the accusation, Biden spokesman Bill Russo said the vice president had been happy to support Flores and to speak on her behalf at the event.  “Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes,” Russo said on Friday in a statement.  Biden believes Flores has every right to share her own recollection, Russo added, and that it is a positive change for U.S. society that she has the opportunity.  In a separate statement on Saturday, Russo said: “People know Joe Biden and they know his character, his integrity and his values,” adding that he was a champion for women.  Biden served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He has not yet said whether he will run for president in 2020, but has been expected to throw his hat into the ring soon.  Some of his potential rivals for the Democratic party’s nomination to take on Republican Donald Trump addressed the allegation on Saturday.  Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, told reporters in Iowa that she believed Flores.  “Joe Biden needs to give an answer,” Warren said.  Julian Castro, a former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development from Texas who is also running for president, said he also found Flores credible, according to news reports.  Flores supported Bernie Sanders in his losing 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination. Although the U.S. Senator from Vermont is running again, Flores has said on Twitter that she has not endorsed any of the candidates in this race.  Should Biden decide to run in 2020, after failed bids to be the party’s nominee in 1988 and 2008, he will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House.

593,593,05-03-19 00:00,2019,3,5,"David Shepardson, Heather Somerville",Uber not criminally liable in fatal 2018 Arizona self-driving crash: prosecutors,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc is not criminally liable in a March 2018 crash in Tempe, Arizona, in which one of the company’s self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian, prosecutors said on Tuesday.  The Yavapai County Attorney said in a letter made public that there was “no basis for criminal liability” for Uber, but that the back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, should be referred to the Tempe police for additional investigation.   Prosecutors’ decision not to pursue criminal charges removes one potential headache for the ride-hailing company as the company’s executives try to resolve a long list of federal investigations, lawsuits and other legal risks ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year.  The crash involved a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle that Uber was using to test self-driving technology. The fatal accident was a setback from which the company has yet to recover; its autonomous vehicle testing remains dramatically reduced.   The accident was also a blow to the entire autonomous vehicle industry and led other companies to temporarily halt their testing. Scrutiny has mounted on the nascent technology, which presents fatal risks but has minimal oversight from regulators.   Vasquez, the Uber back-up driver, could face charges of vehicular manslaughter, according to a police report in June. Vasquez has not previously commented and could not immediately be reached on Tuesday.  Based on a video taken inside the car, records collected from online entertainment streaming service Hulu and other evidence, police said last year that Vasquez was looking down and streaming an episode of the television show “The Voice” on a phone until about the time of the crash. The driver looked up a half-second before hitting Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died from her injuries.  Police called the incident “entirely avoidable.”   Yavapai County Attorney’s Office, which examined the case at the request of Maricopa County where the accident occurred, did not explain the reasoning for not finding criminal liability against Uber. Yavapai sent the case back to Maricopa, calling for further expert analysis of the video to determine what the driver should have seen that night.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter.  The National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are still investigating.  The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office did not immediately comment on Tuesday.   Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering and is expected to seek a valuation of up to $120 billion. Its self-driving program, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars and does not generate revenue yet, is likely to come under scrutiny by investors.   The ride-hailing company, which last year lost about $3.3 billion, is betting on a transition to self-driving cars to eliminate the need to pay drivers.   At an autonomous vehicles conference in Silicon Valley last week, industry leaders lamented the loss of confidence from the public, regulators and investors that lingers a year after the Uber crash. There is no consensus on safety standards for the industry.  In March 2018, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber’s ability to test its self-driving cars. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing program and left Arizona.   In December, Uber resumed limited self-driving car testing in Pittsburgh, restricting the cars to a small loop they can drive only in good weather. The company is now testing with two people in the front seat and more strictly monitors safety drivers. The company also said last year it made improvements to the vehicles’ self-driving software.  Uber has not resumed testing in San Francisco or Toronto, where it previously had programs.  Reporting by David Shepardson.

595,595,24-01-18 22:30,2018,1,24,Jason Bailey,Don't Call Maggie Gyllenhaal's Latest Character 'Unlikable',"Since her breakthrough performance in the 2002 Sundance Film Festival prize winner  Secretary, Maggie Gyllenhaal has been one of the most reliably engaging actors in all of independent cinema, crafting raw, eccentric, and often electrifying performances in films like  Sherrybaby, Away We Go, Crazy Heart, and  Frank. (She also occasionally crosses over to more mainstream ventures, with memorable supporting turns in  The Dark Knight, Stranger Than Fiction, and  Nanny McPhee Returns.) This year, she’s back at Sundance with a leading role in Sara Colangelo’s remake of the 2014 Israeli film  The Kindergarten Teacher. She stars as Lisa Spinelli, a career teacher and would-be poet who discovers that one of her five-year-old students (played by young Parker Stevak) is something of a poetry prodigy—a young Mozart, she insists. Her enthusiastic nurturing of his talent, coupled with her own artistic frustrations, takes the story in unexpected, unpredictable, and somewhat unnerving directions.  The Kindergarten Teacher is also the first feature film on which Gyllenhaal is credited as a producer, so VICE sat down to talk with her about wearing that particular hat while creating this complex, challenging character.  VICE: This character has this intensity and ends up making some poor choices, yet you render her with such sympathy. What did you see in her that you initially identified with, and did that change through the process of making the movie?  Maggie Gyllenhaal: I think women have gotten used to seeing, like, 30 percent of our feminine experience represented realistically in a movie or television show—and we're like,  Cool, that's awesome, I'll use my imagination for the other 70 percent. When I read a script that demands 100 percent of my own feminine expression, that's very exciting.  As I started to think about [the character], I realized she's an artist. The script originally framed her as an ""OK"" poet, which... I think it's a more interesting story if she's a  good poet, if there's a possibility that someone sees her work as compelling and excellent—I mean,  I do. A really phenomenal poet wrote my poems. I was working with them, saying,  ""Maybe there's a way that you can tone this poem down, make it more predictable."" My husband said to me, ""Why? It's a better movie if the poetry's great.""  This is a woman with an exciting mind who's not getting the artistic and human connections she needs. Ultimately, she's driven crazy by the insanity of the culture and the time that she lives in—and she lives in the same culture and time that we do! She crosses way more lines than most of us can imagine crossing, but she's also us. Somebody said to me outside on the street, ""I loved your movie, how were you able to live with such an unlikable person? Why do you have to push her so far away from yourself? Isn't it a more interesting movie if she feels like you?  Branding a character as unlikable shuts off so much interesting conversation, and it gets applied to women way more than men. And this was a woman who said it to me! There's times I'm real unlikable. [Laughs] And there's times where people like me a lot. Isn't that true of every human being?   I have a four-year-old daughter, and there's a very specific way her teachers interact with her. I noticed that you have that very specific communication you have to have with kids around that age. How did you develop that? My daughter is in kindergarten now, and [co-star Parker Sevak] is the same exact age as my daughter, which was very helpful. I didn't want to observe my children at either of their schools—I felt that that was too intrusive. So I asked my daughter's pre-K teacher to recommend a teacher, and I ended up observing this wonderful kindergarten teacher's class. Then we had the kids come in, and I taught them a class. And they all went, ""I know your name isn't Mrs. Spinelli. You're in Batman!""  I keep thinking about the opening shot where you see the ritual of starting the day. We know so much about that character before she's even said a word.  We shot that scene a few times. I remember advocating for a take where I was doing a little breathing exercise. That tells you so much about this person—preparing for the day is a performance. Imagine just taking care of  25 five-year-olds. It's not that different from getting ready to do a play.   This is your second credit as a producer—the first one was   The Deuce, in which you're playing a character who decides that maybe that the real power lies in being a filmmaker. Did you have that same kind of moment where you decided to make the move into producing? I  was inspired by [The Deuce character] Candy to move into directing. She was originally conceived as more of an entrepreneur—a producer—and I was really pushing for her to be a filmmaker, an artist. She goes to make that first porn, and she's like,  Holy shit. She's a storyteller.  I don't want to make a movie that nobody sees, but I also don't want to make movies only so a lot of people will see it—I can't. It drives me crazy! The only thing I can do well are things I am deeply compelled by. That's the truth.  We've heard for a while now that there needs to be more representation on both sides of the camera. Do you think this moment we're having culturally is going to translate into anything that's going to move that needle? I really hope so—and I'm actually hopeful. I'm adapting a book that I would like to direct, and I feel like it's a great time to be doing that—a hopeful time, a supportive time, particularly for women. I'm compelled by the question of, ""What is feminine filmmaking?"" It's different than just movies made by women, right?  I remember being 16 and seeing  The Piano, seeing that image of Holly Hunter with her ankle tied to the rope, to the piano. I can't tell you  why that was something I understood, but it stayed with me for 20 years. There was something fundamentally feminine about it, and I think the same is true for our movie. That's what I'm interested in exploring as a director, and I do believe that there's room for it.  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

596,596,19-05-18 19:32,2018,5,19,Emily Stewart,Trump Jr. met with Saudi Arabia and UAE rep offering 2016 election help,"Russia isn’t the only country Donald Trump Jr. was open to meeting with about getting a boost for his father’s presidential campaign. According to a report from the New York Times on Saturday, the president’s son also met with an Israeli social media specialist and an emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who said the countries wanted to help Donald Trump win. On August 3, 2016, Trump Jr. took part in a meeting with Erik Prince, a Trump booster, founder of the private security firm Blackwater, and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos; George Nader, a business executive and emissary for the princes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and Joel Zamel, an Israeli expert in social media manipulation. The men met at Trump Tower in New York, according to a report from Mark Mazzetti, Ronen Bergman, and David Kirkpatrick. Nader told Trump Jr. that the princes of Saudi Arabia and UAE were “eager” to help Trump win the White House, saying they believed he was a strong leader who would “fill the power vacuum” they thought President Barack Obama had left in the Middle East. Zamel’s company, Psy-Group, had put together a proposal for an online manipulation program to help elect Trump using thousands of fake accounts to promote him on Facebook. According to the Times, it’s not clear whether the proposal was executed, and it’s not clear who commissioned it in the first place. But Trump Jr. “responded approvingly,” and Nader joined the Trump-world fold, meeting often with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his former strategist, Steve Bannon. After the election, Nader paid Zamel as much as $2 million, and what the money’s intended use isn’t clear. White Night, a Philippines-based company linked to Zamel, reportedly provided Nader with an elaborate presentation about the importance of social media campaigning in Trump’s win. There are multiple reasons the report matters. It indicates that it wasn’t just Russia that was offering to help the Trump campaign ahead of the 2016 election. It also raises questions about what sort of repayment the Middle East countries in question might have received for their help. And it demonstrates the Trump campaign’s reckless, if not nefarious, attitude toward campaign laws in the United States. Per the Times: It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what — if any — direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., told the Times that the younger Trump “recalls” a meeting with Prince, Nader, and someone who “may be” Zamel. “They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it,” Futerfas said. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Zamel, said that he had “no involvement whatsoever in the US election campaign.” Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer for Nader, said he has “fully cooperated” with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Nader’s name has come up multiple times in the context of the Mueller investigation. According to the Times, his interactions with Zamel, Prince, and Trump Jr. are a focus of the probe. During the 2016 campaign, Nader visited Moscow at least twice as a confidential emissary from Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, and he helped to arrange a meeting in Seychelles between Prince and a Russian business executive close to Vladimir Putin that Mueller has also been probing. Companies tied to Zamel have connections to Russia as well. And after Trump’s inauguration, Nader was reportedly promoting a proposal to use private contractors for an economic sabotage against Iran that might get the country to abandon its nuclear program. He pitched it to Saudi officials last spring. And he was in discussions with Prince about a plan to convince Saudi Arabia to pay $2 billion to create a private army to fight against Iranian proxy forces in Yemen. The Times’s report asks as many questions as it answers, especially in the final paragraphs, where the writers wonder what Nader’s, Prince’s and Zamel’s efforts may have gotten for Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Since entering the White House, Mr. Trump has allied himself closely with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. His first overseas trip was to Riyadh. He strongly backed Saudi and Emirati efforts to isolate their neighbor Qatar, another American ally, even over apparent disagreement from the State and Defense Departments. This month, Mr. Trump also withdrew from an Obama administration nuclear deal with Iran that both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had campaigned against for years, delivering them their biggest victory yet from his administration.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/19/17372344/donald-trump-jr-saudi-arabia-russia-meeting,,Vox
597,597,26-08-17 18:54,2017,8,26,Cork Gaines,Pedro Martinez says MLB pitchers will make Gary Sanchez pay for sucker punch," On Thursday, the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers were involved in a wild game that included a legit brawl with haymakers, eight ejections, and a fastball to the head James McCann. On Friday, Major League Baseball suspended four players and one manager a total of 17 games, including seven games for Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera. Also among the players receiving suspensions was Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez who received a four-game ban. However, if Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez is correct, the suspension is just the start of problems for Sanchez. Sanchez's suspension likely stems from a sucker punch he threw at Cabrera during the brawl while he was on the ground entangled with Yankees catcher Austin Romine. ""At that moment, just instinct takes over because you want to defend your teammate, that's your family out there,"" Sanchez said after the game through an interpreter. While discussing the brawl on the MLB Network, Martinez noted that this is something the rest of the league is going to remember and that pitchers throughout baseball who are friends with the ever-popular Cabrera may look to exact some revenge. ""The entire league remember those [cheap shots],"" Martinez said. ""Those don't go away ever from the league. And most of the other pitchers, the other friends that Miggy has on different teams, they're going to be looking at that... Gary Sanchez is going to wear it."" Martinez later added on Twitter that Sanchez will be ""badly remembered for this for a long time.""

598,598,25-03-19 00:00,2019,3,25,Heather Kapplow,A New Swiss Museum Shows Women’s Art Through a Multivalent Lens,"A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women at the Museum Susch suggests that letting women be multivalent is a critical piece of letting women be seen. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads SUSCH, Switzerland — It takes some time to determine what artworks are part of the Museum Susch’s inaugural exhibition, A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women, and what belongs to the museum’s permanent, site-specific collection. There’s minimal traditional signage and wall texts have been renounced in favor of a smartphone app. The app works most of the time but not always, and not knowing who made an artwork or whether it is in the exhibition turned out to be pleasant intellectual stimulation. This ambiguity allows layers of meaning to settle, fantastically, on Monika Sosnowska’s “Stairs” (2016-17), for example. The large-scale installation of a staircase deconstructed by invisible forces but straining to rise up read as an effort to ascend from — to transcend — patriarchal models of femininity and womanhood, leaving the exhibition title resting, like dust, on its rungs. As part of the permanent collection, it becomes the museum’s spinal cord, transmitting the knowledge that perspective is always partial. Of the works included in the exhibition, Hannah Wilke’s 1976 video Through the Large Glass is a critical piece. Sited outside of the main entry to the exhibition, in its own little cavern, Wilke’s striptease at the Philadelphia Museum of Art next to Marcel Duchamp’s “The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)” (1915-23) enacts the exhibition’s title as women watch men in the room watching Wilke undress. Wilke’s ritualistic disrobing clearly both challenges and allures her audience. But she also subverts Duchamp’s power and authority with her own. Wilke’s work feels like a spell being cast on visitors before they cross the threshold into the main exhibition hall. Duchamp has described the bride here as the “Pendu femelle”: a female equivalent of the hanged man in Tarot. Perhaps the inclusion of Wilke’s video is a signal that any outdated male/female dynamics must be abandoned upon entering this exhibition. On the other side of the threshold, several paintings explore how female bodies conform to the male gaze, or don’t. In these works women look directly at the viewer and, in some cases, turn the gaze back on us in ways that feel disconcerting. For example, Ida Applebroog’s painting “The Ethics of Desire” (2013), which portrays helmeted, jackbooted, but otherwise nude women marching in formation, implicates the voyeuristic viewer in fascism or Nazism. Conversely, Teresa Pągowska’s semi-abstract painting “Yellow Room” (1970) shows what looks like a woman melting under our gaze. Sarah Lucus’s “Florian” (2013), a giant, gold-plated bronze sculpture in the shape of a butternut squash, is the primary representation of maleness in the room—but, in fact, it lies in a fetal position on the floor instead of standing upright. It still nearly dominates the space, with its size and shiny surface, but its outsized power is neutralized by the many women surrounding it. In a smaller room, works by Lucio Fontana, Renate Bertlmann, and Magdalena Abakanowicz push the boundaries of painting towards sculpture and performance. They treat canvas as a portal or interface rather than a surface, and the results are often easily read as vulvic. Once the surface has been ruptured, sexuality becomes more explicit in the exhibition. The show includes works by many of the art world’s heavy-hitting feminists, including “Fuck Painting #9” (1974) by Betty Tompkins and Carolee Schneemann’s large “Vulva’s Morphia” (1995). Dorothy Iannone’s “Let Me Squeeze Your Fat Cunt” (1970-1971) represents the strategy of many works in the show by wresting sexual language and imagery from tradition, handing it from men to women to exploit both the sexual content and its recontextualization. Comfort & Joy (2015), Julie Verhoeven’s giddy, polymorphously perverse film, employs everything from feathers to cake in service of demonstrating how sexist and archaic Alex Comfort’s 1972 manual The Joy of Sex is, and acts as the capstone of this section of the show. The rest of the exhibition addresses less explicit experiences, such as motherhood, and, more frequently, mourning in relation to motherhood, as in Andrzej Wróblewski’s “Mother with Dead Child” (1949). Cocks reemerge here and there in the upper floors of the museum — but it feels like the focus has shifted away from the form, to color and texture. One possible addition to the show could have been a work accessible only via the app — perhaps a sound piece bringing the strong history of feminist artists working in virtual spaces into conversation with this primarily earthbound collection of works. Many of the museum’s permanent and site-specific works are also by women and seem to address themes adjacent to those of the exhibition. In some ways these other works, though not explicitly included, feel like part of the show, and speak to its fluid boundaries. Among the exhibition’s works, the same artists re-appear with different identities in different rooms — for example, Hanna Wilke, who opens the exhibition as a performance artist, is represented by delicate sculptures near the end. A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women seems to say that letting women be multivalent is a critical piece of letting women be seen. A Woman Looking At Men Looking At Women continues at the Museum Susch (Surpunt 78, Susch, Switzerland) through June 30. The exhibition is curated by Kasia Redzisz.",https://hyperallergic.com/490962/museum-susch-a-woman-looking-at-men-looking-at-women/,,Hyperallergic

601,601,24-01-17 18:10,2017,1,24,Sarah Frostenson,A crowd scientist says Trump’s inauguration attendance was pretty average,"This Saturday very likely marked the largest day of demonstrations in American history. But Friday’s inauguration had, well, pretty average turnout for a presidential inauguration. And the new administration had a problem with that, as we saw with an alarming series of false statements from President Donald Trump and his press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday. To try to settle the question of how many people attended the inauguration ceremony on the National Mall in Washington, DC, we reached out to Keith Still, a professor of crowd science at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. (He analyzed aerial shots of the crowds of both President Obama’s 2009 inaugural address and President Trump’s for the New York Times.) His conclusion is that the crowd on the Mall on Friday was roughly one-third the size of President Obama’s. If Still is right, and Trump’s inauguration attracted a third of the 2009 crowd, then there were anywhere from 300,000 to 600,000 people on the Mall on Friday. President Obama’s historic 2009 inaugural address drew 1.8 million people, which officials consider the largest gathering on the Mall ever. But as Still told Vox, not all 1.8 million were on the Mall — crowds extended behind the Washington Monument and outside the view of the aerial photos used in analysis. As you can see in the chart above, presidential inauguration attendance isn’t very consistent. In recent years, the first inauguration has been better attended than the second for a two-term president. But this wasn’t true for President George W. Bush — his second inauguration purportedly drew a larger crowd than the first. The inaugural attendance numbers above largely come from various news outlets that arrived at these estimates through interviews and on-the-ground reporting with inauguration planners to assess crowd size. The National Park Service and the Office of the DC Mayor told me they won’t be releasing estimates of Friday’s event. (NPS was banned from releasing official crowd estimates after an especially controversial count involving attendance at the Million Man March in 1995. In 2009 it broke tradition and provided the 1.8 million estimate for Obama’s inauguration attendance.) As you can see in this tweet from Matt Viser at the Boston Globe, President Trump might have perceived a large crowd from the podium, but as you move farther down the Mall, the crowd is less tightly packed. How does a vantage point matter? These photos were both taken at about noon. One is what Sean Spicer now has on display in WH briefing room. pic.twitter.com/5MYIClNhp8 “When you are barely above the head level of a crowd that extends back several hundred yards, it does look an unbroken sea of humanity,” said Steve Doig, a professor at Arizona State University with experience in estimating large crowds. “But people’s ability to estimate numbers bigger than what they can count on their fingers is not something we do well.” This is a satellite image taken from space that helped analysts measure crowd attendance at Obama’s inauguration in 2009. Charles Seife, a mathematician and professor of journalism at New York University, has written about the perils of counting crowds. He told me that using satellite imagery is one of the best ways to measure the size of a crowd if it’s not a strictly ticketed event, but warned it’s not a perfect tool. But unfortunately, given Friday’s inclement weather we’re unlikely to get comparable images with such clear resolution for the recent gatherings on the Mall. Doig said that for future events, organizers and journalists should work to get real-time estimates that don’t rely on aerial photos, especially for large events in DC, as DC falls under a no-fly zone, making it difficult to get aerial shots to begin with. Doig said one thing you could do to get reliable real-time estimates is to have a team of 20 or so people scattered throughout a large event, and have them measure by square feet how closely people are standing next to each other. “I’d assign random locations for people to stand, and the key thing they’d have to report is how dense the crowd is, measuring it by square feet,” he said. “Then we’d use those estimates on a grid [of the Mall’s area] to average across and total up what we might think is an overall reasonable count.” Doig thinks a methodology like this could be implemented relatively easily and only take 30 minutes or so to provide reasonably accurate estimates. As Vox’s Ezra Klein writes, what is truly frightening in how the Trump administration has responded to media stories covering the size of the crowd present at the inauguration is its apparent utter disregard for facts. Among Spicer’s slew of falsehoods on Saturday was this: “This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, both in person and around the globe.” This simply isn’t true. Metro ridership did not surpass 2009 levels, and television ratings indicate not as many people tuned in as they did in 2009 either. And as Doig told me, “[Spicer] offered no reason for us to believe they have attempted to do a reality-based estimate of the crowd, other than quoting President Trump saying it looked like a million and a half [people].” As my colleague Alvin Chang illustrates, the consequences of the Trump administration repudiating numbers it simply doesn’t agree with could have dangerous repercussions when it comes to government data sets we rely on for accuracy and the health of democracy.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/24/14354036/crowds-presidential-inaugurations-trump-average,,Vox
602,602,16-11-17 00:00,2017,11,16,Ruby Brunton,A New Biography of Paula Modersohn-Becker Reveals an Artist Committed to Painting Women,"Though Paula Modersohn-Becker’s name rarely appears alongside famous men in the annals of art history, she deserves her own biography, and Marie Darrieussecq has written it. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In the basement of the Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany, home to one of the most famous collections of 19th- and 20th-century European painting, are the paintings of women subjects, and the paintings of women artists. In the low-ceilinged, dimly-lit room, amongst the images of mothers and children, goddesses and nymphs, situated slightly out of sight behind a television monitor, hung a self-portrait of a young woman with almond eyes and a red smile holding a branch pulled from a camellia tree. She stares out at us, determinedly, with a look of concentration on her face. The absence of her second hand suggests she is in fact in the process of painting herself. But, who is she? And why do we even need to ask? When I Google search “Paula M. Becker,” almost every entry insists she was one of the most important figures in early Expressionism, a contemporary of men we are on last-name basis with: Picasso, Gauguin, Matisse, Munch. In her native Germany, her works adorn postcards, magnets, and posters. She has been heralded as the first Western woman artist to paint herself naked. She has been claimed as the first Western woman artist to paint herself pregnant. She traveled often to Paris and developed close friendships with the painter Heinrich Vogeler and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. She began a series of correspondence based around a mutual admiration for the other’s art with Otto Modersohn, which lead to their marriage in 1901. And yet, her name barely appears alongside these men in the annals of art history. She deserves her own biography. Luckily, Marie Darrieussecq has written it. The fascination with these lost characters of history, often encountered as a footnote or brief chapter in someone else’s story, can lead a writer on an incredible journey. When Darrieussecq encountered Becker’s work, used as an illustration on a flyer for a psychoanalysis symposium on motherhood, she recognized the painting but not the painter. So began her nearly five-year journey into discovering who Becker was, how she lived and what made her “be” besides her painting. Of course, there is always more to the story than just the work itself for those whose work resonates throughout decades, but often these details are locked away by more traditional biographers who have little time for details of the character’s personal lives. Darrieussecq, so taken with Becker and her celebrity-studded social circle, and wanting to understand who she was and how she came to paint the way she did, leaves no stone unturned in her quest for information on Becker. The slight, 140-odd-page biography, Being Here is Everything: The Life of Paula Modersohn-Becker, sparkles with details of Becker’s close friendships and artistic training. Darrieussecq, whose first novel Pig Tales was a finalist for the Prix Goncourt in 1996, brings a penchant for beautiful details nestled amongst bare sentences that provide them necessary context. Describing Becker’s daily life for example, Darrieussecq devotes her attention not to how she spent her days but what she plants in her garden, “In the garden, around the house, she has planted rose bushes, tulips, carnations, anemones.” Evoking the flurry of time passing at parties she describes their free time: “Boating parties, swimming in the rivers, Isadora Duncan-style dancing; Otto plays the flute. And nudism.” It’s the perfect use of language paired with Becker’s own economy of color and background, and attention to fine details, such as a branch or a necklace, or the three perfectly balanced flowers atop her head in her 1906 self portrait. Becker, by Darrieussecq’s account, comes across as a resolute, bright, and curious young woman who is as diligent about her craft as she is devoted to her friends. She was sent to England to study at St John’s Wood School of Art, but at age 18, after returning to Germany and completing teacher training, while also taking painting classes in Bremen, she shunned a traditional life as a teacher. After two years at the traditional School for Women Artists in Berlin, she threw herself into the artistic community at Worpswede under the tutelage of Fritz Mackensen. It feels that it would’ve required this level of determination to push her way into the artistic circles of a group of men who would go on to be remembered in the art historical canon. “So you died the way women used to die in the old days … the death of women in childbirth who want to close themselves up and are no longer able to.” Rilke writes in “Requiem” after Becker’s death. A greater tragedy than us not knowing her name is that, at age 31, she was snatched away from those who did. She had married the painter Otto Modersohn 6 years earlier, after many years of artistic companionship while he was with his first wife, and died, as she had, in childbirth. The first woman to paint herself pregnant did not live long enough to see the fruits of her labor. A traditional marriage was too confining for Becker, and she would often leave Modersohn for long periods to paint. At age 27, she moved alone to Paris, dividing her time between art classes, spending time with her friends, and visiting museums such as the Louvre — where, at the time, only four paintings by women artists were on display. The year of Becker’s death, Rilke writes to the sculptor Clara Westhoff of a wall at the Autumn Salon devoted to a woman artist who died young and in childbirth: Manet’s student Eva Gonzalès. Becker certainly had a profound affect on Rilke; she was a “courageous and combative” woman, he writes to her mother after Becker’s death. And, “Someday there will be girls and women whose name will no longer mean the mere opposite of the male, but something … that makes one think not of any complement or limit, but only of life and reality.” He tells Franz Xaver Krappus, the young poet. Becker’s freedom of expression and desire to live a non-conventional life, which were reflected in her work, were not always considered ground-breaking. In 1935, two of her nudes were pointed out by the Nazis as examples of degenerate art, and the museum devoted to her limited collection was denounced as promoting vulgarity. Darrieussecq views Becker’s approach to her subjects instead as liberatory: a woman painting real women, her depictions free from the desire to possess or dominate. In the writer’s view Becker is a woman painting other women as she sees them, a woman painting herself as she wants us to see her. Is it vulgar to want to depict another view of womanhood? The debate rages on today as we analyze the values applied to selfie art. How would Becker have felt about these new modes of artistic self-representation? It’s a pity we can’t ask. Months before her death, she fears her lack of artistic success is a disappointment to those around her. “It may still be a long time before I am somebody,” She wrote to Rilke. A long time indeed, this biography has been a long time coming. “Schade” was her last living word — a shame. And indeed it was, but at least she’s here now. A year after Marie Darrieussecq ventured to the Museum Folkwang to meet with Michel Vincent, the director of the Franco-German Cultural Center of Essen, he informed her that Becker’s painting has been moved upstairs to take its place amongst the museum’s permanent collection. Like any writer who strives to resurrect the work of forgotten women geniuses, I hope this was due to Darrieussecq’s fervent interest in her subject and insistence on the importance of her work. What a delightful ray of hope, if this is so.",https://hyperallergic.com/411938/a-new-biography-of-paula-modersohn-becker-reveals-an-artist-committed-to-painting-women/,,Hyperallergic

10. The Battle of the Whispering Wood, ""Baelor"" (Season 1, Episode 9)






 Ah, who could forget the decisive battle at the start of the War of the Five Kings, when Robb Stark's forces ambushed and destroyed the army led by Jaime Lannister, taking the Kingslayer captive? Well, most people could forget it, honestly. Back in season one, budgetary and logistical issues prevented the series from actually depicting massive battles, leading to some … interesting workarounds. (Remember Tyrion preparing to lead a charge of hill-tribe barbarians against the Northmen, only to get knocked out cold and miss the fight entirely?) That said, the offscreen depiction of the Battle of the Whispering Wood tracked closely with how author George R.R. Martin wrote it in his book: A nervous Catelyn Stark stands on a hillside above the forest where the fighting takes place, waiting and wondering if her beloved son will survive his first brush with war. Watch the battle here.

A character we've barely seen or heard of, who's part of a family pushed to the margins of the narrative for years, is suddenly a major villain and a contender for Queen Cersei's hand? How do you sell that? By turning the newly crowned King of the Iron Islands into the cockiest, craziest Greyjoy of the bunch, which is saying something. Actor Pilou Asbæk can smile and swagger like the Red Viper, then run headlong into the heat of battle like a mad pirate — in this case, by boarding the lead ship in his niece Yara Greyjoy's fleet after his forces set it on fire. The swiftness and devastation of his navy's attack on their rivals, plus his devil-may-care abandon in single-handedly capturing, killing, or scattering Daenerys Targaryen's allies in two of the Seven Kingdoms — Yara and Theon for the Iron Islands, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes for Dorne — make his prowess plainly clear. This is the best of the short and not-so-sweet battles GOT has pulled off, from the fights with the Night's Watch mutineers at Craster's Keep to the rebellions and insurgencies between slaves and masters in Meereen. Watch the battle here.

8. Daenerys and the dragons versus the slavers, “Battle of the Bastards” (Season 6, Episode 9)






 A few thousand dead Lannisters and incinerated zombies later, the damage inflicted by the dragons on the fleet amassed by an alliance of slave states against Daenerys Targaryen's free city of Meereen may not seem as impressive as it once did. What's more, the assault itself was overshadowed by the all-out carnage of the titular Battle of the Bastards later in the same episode. But the surprise attack by Daenerys and her three children against the Slavers' ships (complemented as always by her Dothraki and Unsullied soldiers) was so devastating that it changed geopolitical history in the region, breaking the power of the slave trade over Meereen once and for all. Hearing hundreds of sailors scream as they burn to death will do that. Watch it here.

7. Dany’s guards versus the Sons of the Harpy, “The Dance of Dragons” (Season 5, Episode 9)






 Another surprise dragon attack — noticing a pattern yet? — dominates the rumble between soldiers loyal to Daenerys Targaryen and the pro-slavery Sons of the Harpy in this season five highlight. Sort of Meereen's answer to the KKK, the Sons of the Harpy had Dany and friends surrounded — until Drogon, the black dragon who'd fled previous attempts to contain him, suddenly returned to toast his mother's assailants. This first glimpse of a dragon in serious action was shocking, conveyed amid the carnage through the eyes of our audience-identification character, Tyrion Lannister. When Dany hopped aboard her flying weapon to escape the fray, the game had clearly changed. Watch the scene her e.

6. Daenerys and the dragons versus the White Walkers, “Beyond the Wall” (Season 7, Episode 6)






 Unlike the other battles on this list, this one was more like a brawl, at least in numerical terms. The Night King and his White Walkers had untold thousands of zombies on their side; the only enemies they faced were Jon Snow, Tormund Giantsbane, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, and Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane (plus a bunch of redshirts, killable at your convenience). It wasn't until Dany and her children swooped in to save the day — and the Night King hurled his magic spear to take one of them down— that this truly became an illustration of what all-out, dragon-on-demon combat might look like in the Great War to come. The battle had its wonky logistical issues, for sure, but it made up for them in sheer epic spectacle. Watch the scene here.

5. The Wildlings versus the Night’s Watch, “The Watchers on the Wall” (Season 4, Episode 9)






 As meticulously choreographed a battle as television has ever seen, the fight for the Wall that ended season four — in which the badly outmanned Night's Watch, led by rival brothers in black Jon Snow and Ser Alliser Thorne, held off Wildling forces attacking from both North and South — played like one long highlight reel. Giants riding mammoths and wielding battering rams! Gigantic ice scythes released from the Wall to splatter attackers right off its surface! An unbroken 360-degree shot within Castle Black as duels between all the major characters raged! The death of Ygritte, Jon Snow's star-crossed wildling lover, in his arms! Even if it took Stannis Baratheon's sneak attack to defeat the Wildlings for good in the following episode — a fate he'd suffer in turn when Ramsay and Roose Bolton overran his demoralized forces outside Winterfell the following season — this was a fight worth remembering. Watch part of it here.

4. Daenerys, Drogon, and the Dothraki versus the Lannisters, “The Spoils of War” (Season 7, Episode 4)






 No one saw this battle coming. Instead, they heard it. Following the Lannisters' victory over House Tyrell at Highgarden — a battle they'd cleverly abandoned their own stronghold of Casterly Rock to conduct, leaving Dany's conquering Unsullied forces confused and stranded inside — the army led by Jaime Lannister, his comrade Bronn, and their new allies Randyll and Dickon Tarly caravanned its way up the Goldroad to King's Landing, delivering the cash and crops they'd looted during the campaign. That's when a Dothraki cavalry charge so large that its hoofbeats shook the ground descended upon them, with Daenerys and her black dragon Drogon conducting air support. The result was an all-out slaughter— and that's without the death from above delivered by Drogon, which now boasts the size and the power of a modern-day bomber. Individual face-offs between Bronn and Drogon and Jaime and Dany, not to mention the Lannister commanders' terrified faces, kept the action rooted in personal moments. Watch it here.

3. Battle of the Blackwater, “Blackwater” (Season 2, Episode 9)






 The show's first major battle, and the centerpiece of what remains its best episode to date, set the standard for pretty much everything to come. The amphibious assault on King's Landing by the forces of would-be King Stannis Baratheon divided our sympathies: Are Stannis and Melisandre worse than Joffrey and Cersei? Is Davos better than Tyrion? You'd better choose in a hurry! The battle also featured a lynchpin spectacle, with the dazzling green explosion of wildfire that sunk a large part of the Baratheon fleet before they could make land. The cost of war was emphasized in the screams of the burning soldiers and the terror faced by noncombatants like Cersei and Sansa — to say nothing of the way that PTSD-afflicted Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane simply quit fighting and stormed off. The Battle of the Blackwater even featured the now-standard last-minute surprise attack that turned the tide, this time led by Tywin Lannister and Loras Tyrell as the first act in the two great families' alliance. Textbook work from start to finish. Watch the battle here.

2. Battle of the Bastards, “Battle of the Bastards” (Season 6, Episode 9)






 Ramsay Bolton got his comeuppance, Rickon Stark's short life came to an end, Wun Wun the giant went out in a blaze of glory, Sansa Stark pulled Jon's ass from the fire, House Stark recaptured Winterfell after years in the wilderness: You know all the details about season six's climactic confrontation. But it's the visual component of the Battle of the Bastards that makes it so memorable. At one point, the fighting between Jon and Ramsay's forces was so horrific that the dead bodies piled up into a literal pile — a physical obstacle that the fighters had to climb above or drown beneath. Every speech Jon or Davos ever made about the folly of fighting each other was made real in this moment, which turned the mass murder of warfare into an actual geographical feature of the battle. It was a moment of macabre beauty, power, and tragedy. Watch it here.

1. The Wildlings and the Night’s Watch versus the White Walkers, “Hardhome” (Season 5, Episode 8)






 When all's said and done, the massacre at Hardhome will be battle we remember. It's the fulcrum upon which ""GOT""'s depiction of warfare pivoted from human conflicts to the fight against death itself. In this battle — filmed as chaotically as possible and breaking from George R.R. Martin's source material so completely that even the most devoted fan was left as shocked as the characters themselves — the Night King and his army of the dead descended upon a remote fishing village, where Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane had come to broker a truce with the wildlings in order to move everyone to safety south of the Wall. The White Walkers had other plans, however, and they unleashed their undead hordes with seismic fury. Like the Dothraki, you could hear them coming before you saw them. Like the Battle of the Bastards, the dead became part of the battle's topography, in this case taking the form of a literal avalanche of corpses as the wights plunged over a cliff to enter the fray. Like the death of Dany's dragon Viserion at the point of the Night King's spear, the way the demonic monarch brought everyone he'd just slain back to life merely by raising his hands illustrated the sheer magical power and total disregard for life of humanity's true opponents. And as in every battle, moments of individual heroism, sacrifice, and tragedy leavened the spectacle with ground-level emotion. Hardhome had it all. Watch the battle here.

604,604,20-04-18 21:44,2018,4,20,Juli Fraga,This Is the Difference Between Normal Fighting and Verbal Abuse,"As a psychologist, I often hear stories about fighting. After all, conflict is a normal part of any relationship and, during heated conversations, feelings of anger and frustration can swell, causing us to snap at our partners. However, when I hear about people who make threats, resort to name-calling, and yell whenever they get riled up, I get concerned. It’s normal to lose one's cool occasionally if you’re arguing with your partner about something, but if these verbal slingshots happen regularly, it may be a sign of emotional abuse. Because the signs may be subtle, discerning between a heated argument and verbal abuse can be tricky. I’ve seen many people who didn’t realize they were being abused until they began therapy. Oftentimes, they unknowingly minimize or justify their partner’s actions, by telling themselves things, like: “He’s just stressed out from work; once we get away for a vacation, things will get better,” or “He has trouble coping with anger. I know he didn’t mean the cruel things he said to me.” When caustic words like “I wouldn’t get angry if you weren’t so sensitive,” or “You brought the conflict on yourself. I’m not apologizing,” become the norm, not a rare exception, it may be time to re-examine the well-being of your relationship. It might sound surprising, but nearly 50 percent of women and men have experienced at least one psychologically unsafe encounter with a partner. While it's difficult to ignore the damage inflicted by physical violence—like black eyes and bruises—the psychological wounds left by verbal punches aren't nearly as noticeable. But that doesn't mean they aren't just as damaging to one’s self-esteem and mental health as physical violence.  And while there’s often a thin line between fighting and verbal abuse, there are a few tell-tale signs that could indicate you’re in an emotionally abusive relationship. Abusers typically feel very powerless which causes them to grasp for power and control by blaming and shaming others. One way they do this is by resorting to name-calling and (non-constructive) criticism whenever differences arise. If your partner drops f-bombs, or continuously magnifies your shortcomings in a way that attacks your character, it may be a sign they're trying to disempower you. Throwing out insults, like “You never know what you’re talking about,” or “I’m not in the wrong, you’re just too dumb to grasp what I’m talking about,” could signify that your partner needs to garner all the power in the partnership by trying to cut you down.  Abusers don't always yell and swear whenever things go awry. Sometimes they resort to guilt-inducing tactics as a way to make you feel badly. For example, someone might say, ""If you really cared about me, you wouldn't have rescheduled our date for tonight,"" or ""I thought we had a special bond, but I must have been mistaken because if we were really close, you wouldn't act this way."" These types of accusations may cause you to second-guess your decisions. You may even begin to take responsibility for the conflict, even when it's not your fault. Watch More from VICE: “I never called you a bitch; I said you were bitchy. It’s not my fault you can’t tell the difference.” Verbal abusers often deny your reality by invalidating your feelings. Also, known as “gaslighting,” this form of manipulation can cause you to feel like you’re losing their mind. People who gaslight might also distort the truth and when you point out the discrepancy, they insist that  you misunderstood. Over time, this pattern erodes a person's sense of confidence. The abuser may even use this tactic to foster dependency—that is, getting you to rely on their suggestions because you doubt your own perception of things.  A client once told me: “After our worst fights, my boyfriend always makes it up to me. He’s sweet and buys me flowers. He tells me how sad he’d be if I ever left him.” After a verbal attack, even though the abuser may not fully take responsibility for his or her behavior, they often shower you with praise, gifts, or affection. When abuse is subtle, this type of behavior can mask the dangers of repeated verbal attacks. However, if there’s a cycle to the way you argue and you dread fighting, it might be a sign that you’re caught in the cycle of violence. After a night out with friends, abusive partners may accuse you of not paying attention to them, or insist that you have a thing for a friend or a co-worker. When you deny these accusations, they may demand that you prove it to them by asking to read your texts and emails. Deep down, abusers often feel like they do not matter, but instead of disclosing their fears, they project them onto others. ""I don't know why you think your job is such a big deal; it's not like you went to an Ivy League school."" Trying to strip you of your power, verbal abusers often devalue your accomplishments and your appearance. At the same time, they often inflate their sense of importance and success. They may even insult you in public, and if you speak up about your hurt feelings, they're quick to insist that you misunderstood the comment. The pain of verbal abuse can chip away at your psychological well-being. If you suspect you might be in an emotionally unsafe situation, talk to a trusted friend or family member and seek professional counseling.

605,605,17-06-19 00:00,2019,6,17,,Alibaba proposes one-to-eight stock split ahead of up to $20 billion HK listing,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Alibaba Group Holding has proposed a one-to-eight stock split ahead of a listing in Hong Kong later this year that is expected to raise up to $20 billion.  The split, to be presented to shareholders for a vote at an annual general meeting in Hong Kong on July 15, will increase flexibility in the firm’s capital raising activities, including the issuance of new shares, the e-commerce giant said.  The firm’s board recommends shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal, it added in its statement dated Friday but published on the company’s website on Monday.  “The ... subdivision will increase the number of shares available for issuance at a lower per share price,” it added.  Alibaba has filed confidentially for a Hong Kong listing, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.  Alibaba has also proposed to change the ratio of ordinary shares to American Depositary Shares (ADS) to eight ordinary shares representing one ADS to neutralize the impact of share split on its ADS listed in the U.S. market.

606,606,14-06-18 18:06,2018,6,14,Andrew Prokop,"Read: inspector general report on Comey, FBI, Clinton, and 2016 campaign","A long-awaited report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on the FBI’s actions during the 2016 campaign has now been released. The report reviews then-FBI Director James Comey’s key decisions about the Hillary Clinton email investigation, as well as the actions of other Justice Department officials. (It does not focus on the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which is still ongoing.) Horowitz was appointed to his post by President Obama back in 2012 and has a reputation for nonpartisanship. Inspectors general traditionally operate with a measure of independence from government higher-ups. Furthermore, Horowitz began this review before Trump even took office. So it would be a mistake to view Horowitz’s report as designed to serve President Trump’s ends. Still, it will be released in a political context dominated by special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe and Trump’s attacks on his own Justice Department. Indeed, Trump has been eagerly anticipating this report, since it was expected to criticize Comey and he is trying to undermine Comey’s credibility.

607,607,23-02-16 13:30,2016,2,23,Clayton Aldern,Meet the scientist connecting the dots between air pollution and dementia,"Originally published as part of Grist's ""Climate on the Mind"" series. At first blush, you might not think air quality is related to brain health. But what if the two are connected? Air pollution continues to worsen in the developing world, especially in rapidly developing countries like China and India; at the same time, our global population is aging, and dementia rates are expected to rise accordingly. Increasingly, research suggests a link between air pollution exposure and the risk of diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. How might this relationship be possible, and what might it mean for what the world is — or isn’t — prepared to handle in the coming decades? Aaron Reuben is a science writer, recovering policy wonk, and neuropsychologist in training who’s exploring just these questions. He's a PhD student at Duke, and his journalistic endeavors include an eye-opening feature for Mother Jones (cross-posted at Grist) that draws attention to the connection between dementia and dirty air. Driving Reuben’s work is the notion that the countries that will see the most aging in the coming years are the same countries that are going to have the most polluted air — and the same places that have some of the least developed infrastructure for diagnosing and treating brain disease. I caught up with Reuben to chat about the state of the science, the justice issues at stake, and the difficulties of communicating the invisible. Clayton Aldern: What do we know about the links between air pollution and dementia? Aaron Reuben: There are two branches of relevant science here. The first body of research studies people in older age brackets and maps their health outcomes onto possible air pollution exposures generated from regional pollution-monitoring data. When you do that, you find that people who are exposed to more air pollution, particularly fine particles, show an increased risk for dementia and pre-dementia, called mild cognitive impairment. A study that came out of Taiwan, for example, drew on a cohort of nearly 100,000 people and showed that for every unit increase in exposure to particle pollution, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s went up by more than 100 percent. Of course, before we can say that one causes the other, one of the things that needs to happen is for data to arrive from longitudinal studies in which you follow people from day one, categorize their exposures, follow their outcomes, and control for things you’d like to control for, like exposures to other toxins like lead. But every month and every year, more and more studies are coming out, and the fact that they’re all finding the same thing is very compelling. The other kinds of studies that are contributing to the evidence base are animal studies. You can’t sit someone down and expose them to air pollution and watch their brains degenerate in real time. But you can do that in mice. There are a lot of studies coming out now on changes in cell dynamics and epigenetics in mice exposed to air pollution, and you see that many of the changes are in the direction of Alzheimer’s disease and heavily related to dementia outcomes. Something that’s really sexy that hasn’t been published yet is studies using transgenic mice that have been engineered to develop Alzheimer’s-type pathology. If you expose generations of these mice to air pollution and that changes the development of pathology, then you can make a call that in this particular animal, the exposure to fine particles fostered the disease. So far the mouse studies are pointing in the same direction as the cohort studies. CA: So are we at ""smoking causes lung cancer"" levels of evidence? AR: No, we’re not there yet. But when people ask me this, I also ask them how long it took to get there for lung cancer. How long did we think cigarettes caused cancer before we were finally willing to say we know? It took decades. I don’t think anyone thinks the evidence is going to start weighing against this trend. It’s a matter of how long new research needs to pile up before people are willing to make a bold statement. CA: And what do we know about how pollution might contribute to dementia? AR: There are a couple ways we think it works. One is by nature of the fact that some of the particles are very small. Your sense of smell is a very potent sense, and there is a direct connection from the nose to the brain via the nasal nerve. That means that once you get something in your nose, if it’s small enough, it can pass into the nerve and make its way all the way to the brain. Keep in mind that pollution particles typically bring in a host of other nasty things with them, including heavy metals — things that can directly kill neurons. The end result is a disruption of the brain’s homegrown immune system. Microglia cells — which clear waste, trim away dead neurons, improve synaptic connections, and clear pathogens — end up performing an unsuccessful process. They continue to release oxidative chemicals that are designed to kill pathogens, but instead of killing anything, the chemicals just accumulate and disrupt neural activity. The damage this causes looks a lot like what you see in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s patients. Another mechanism comes via the lungs. When pollution particles are inhaled into the lungs, they tend to be small enough to make it past the body’s defenses and end up in the deepest tissue, where they then pass into the bloodstream. When they do that, they trigger an immune reaction that circulates molecules related to inflammation, cytokines, in the bloodstream — the kind of thing that seems to cause chronic low-level inflammation wherever the particles go. We’re not sure if the particles can enter the brain through the blood directly or if the chemicals they trigger actually reach the brain, but there’s evidence that they interact with the blood-brain barrier and damage it somehow. It’s all about low-level inflammation that turns into long-term damage. Particles that enter through the nose will cause neuroinflammation directly, and particles that enter through the lungs will also cause neuroinflammation indirectly. CA: You’ve suggested we’re past the tipping point at which this theory is going to be wholly refuted, but you’ve also cited overly cautious scientists who are wary of overstating the evidence. Why do you think this hesitance exists? AR: I think in all of science there’s a tendency to be as precise as possible. It’s never unusual for scientists to hedge their bets. But the other thing I think is going on here is that there’s been a sort of history of jumping the gun on Alzheimer’s. We’ve been talking about one cause, but there are many ways to brain disease. The brain is uniquely susceptible to damage. Air pollution isn’t causing all the dementia we see around us. There’s pesticide exposure, there are concussions — there’s not just one way to get this disease. And it’s also a function of your cumulative exposures and your genetic predisposition. There’s a lot to fear when it comes to dementia. It comes out of nowhere, there’s no cure, it erases everything about you. If you can point to something that’s causing it, people are going to take you seriously. That’s what happened with the aluminum scare in the 1980s, which led to sensationalist headlines and people worrying about their pans and the things they were drinking. The studies that found unusually large aluminum deposits in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients were real, but that didn’t mean that your personal exposure to aluminum actually influenced your dementia risk. The field of gerontology remembers this and is going to be slow to embrace air pollution. Especially because it’s something that everyone is exposed to, unlike, say, a concussion. CA: I’m interested in what you just said about air pollution being something everyone is exposed to. There are obviously inherent justice questions at stake here given the inequities of air pollution exposure. How does environmental justice enter the conversation for you? AR: I think there are two things going on, and neither of them are good. The same communities that are reliably exposed to the most air pollution are the same communities that have the fewest resources to defend themselves or compensate for the effects. Something you see time and again is that high-income, high-resourced individuals not only can buffer themselves against exposure to air pollution — they live in the nice parts of town, they don’t live by busy roads, they live by a lot of greenery, which we know can reduce pollution levels — but they also have the resources to respond to the kinds of cognitive impairments that we’re predicting. Researchers at the University of Southern California have found that air pollution levels are linked to developmental disorders. We know that if your child has a developmental disorder, there are plenty of services and activities to improve their cognitive abilities. These are the kinds of things that aren’t always available to low-income communities, who are also at greater risk. Another thing that people are talking about are the synergistic stressors at play. It’s not just that you’re living in a neighborhood that has higher levels of air pollution, it’s that there might also be more violence in your social environment. You might have an incarcerated family member. These are many forms of adversity that, on their own, modify the way the brain develops and modify a slew of risk factors. When you put them all together, these effects may be magnified. CA: What if I buy your story about air pollution and dementia but can’t move out of my heavily polluted neighborhood? What are my options? AR: Something we used to study in my old lab was called cognitive reserve. The basic idea is that there are some things you can do that appear to make you more resilient against showing symptoms of disease or brain injury. It’s based on old evidence of people who had died and, once an autopsy of their brain was done, appeared to have had Alzheimer’s-like pathology — but there was no evidence they had Alzheimer’s when they were alive. And it seems to be the case that they were compensating somehow for the brain damage. There are certain things we know lead to good cognitive reserve. Yes, a lot of them are associated with your socioeconomic status, but some of them aren’t. If you have a higher IQ, it seems you’re buffered a bit against insults to your brain. For every year of education you get, your risk of presenting Alzheimer’s goes down — not because you’re immune to the disease, but because if you start to get early damage, you’re more able to deal with the damage in a way that maintains your cognitive function. More physical activity is another one. With respect to age, young people and old people are the most vulnerable. Young people’s brains are still developing; old people have brains that are less likely to bounce back and repair themselves after injury. As a society, we can choose to design better communities around some of this knowledge. In California, there’s a law that says you can’t put an elementary school on a busy road. But we can’t all move. In Beijing, if you wanted to move, you’d have to change your whole life. You can’t escape the pollution. CA: I feel like there’s a certain paradox here when you mention a place like Beijing. We’re building these factories in the name of progress, but for whom? If people’s brains are atrophying because of exposure to air pollution, there’s a pretty abysmal vicious circle going on. AR: It’s not just that we’re going to die younger or age more poorly. There’s lots of evidence that you’re stopping people at the start of their lives. Studies have found that kids drop IQ points for every unit of air pollution exposure. Or look at what’s happening in Flint [Michigan]. There’s a whole generation of kids getting set at a disadvantage from day one. We’re doing the damage to ourselves. CA: Something like climate change is already so slow and abstract. Something like air quality isn’t always something you can see. When you combine these kinds of things with mental health or brain health — which are already siloed off from the rest of the health spectrum — there’s a lot of abstraction going on in one place. That must make these effects particularly difficult to communicate. Does this ever leave you frustrated? AR: This actually reminds me of something I’m working on now, which is trying to look at the long-term effects of exposure to positive things like parks and green spaces — improved environments. I think of it as the flip side of these stressors. Almost everyone you talk to can speak at a personal level to the benefit of green spaces. Trying to find that effect in data and trying to make that data compelling is hard. There are a lot of things that are going to contribute to how well or how poorly you live. Something like your environment is just one of them. Trying to pull out the influence of that one factor is really hard, both scientifically and with respect to communication. But we do know the places where people are getting older. In a lot of those places, we can reliably say there are going to be greater rates of dementia than there should be. A lot of those places don’t have infrastructure yet for diagnosing or treating these things, and I think it’s time we started thinking about the resources that need to be put into place in the areas where the air is bad. At some point we’re going to have to start paving the way to dealing with the brain health crisis that’s coming. Of course it’d be great to clean up the air in these places, and we know how to clean up the air, but we’re not going to be able to do it right away. In the meantime, we know who the people are at risk, and we know pretty well what’s going to happen. Can we start getting ready for that in a real way?

608,608,05-11-18 00:00,2018,11,5,,Eni to look at sanctions measures to see if it can use Iranian crudes,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni will look at the Iran sanctions measures to see if it can use Iranian crudes to allow it greater flexibility in procuring supplies, a spokesman said on Monday.  “Eni is examining the ... provisions to see if the decision allows it to consider the use of Iranian crudes for further flexibility in its crude supply system,” the spokesman said.

Ed Brookover, a veteran Republican strategist who helped organize the Republican National Convention two weeks ago, and Jimmy Stracner, who was the campaign's Western regional political director, have been let go. Both had worked for Ben Carson's campaign before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. A source familiar with the firings told Politico that two other senior campaign aides, William McGinley and Mike McSherry, would take on elevated roles. The Trump campaign confirmed Brookover's departure in a statement but did not mention Stracner. ""The campaign has parted ways with Ed, but we are thankful to him for his many contributions and appreciate his continued support,"" the statement from spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. Trump's challenger, Hillary Clinton, received a bump in the polls after last week's Democratic National Convention and is now beating Trump nationally.

610,610,23-03-19 00:00,2019,3,23,Paul D'AgostinoThomas Micchelli,A Frankenstein for the Forever Wars,"Depraved, a soulful indie take on Frankenstein, proves the perennial relevance of Mary Shelley’s monstrous creation. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads I wrote the following capsule review of Depraved, a new film by Larry Fessenden, just after viewing it, in part to spur on ideas for a fuller review: Immediately ensnaring and narratively circuitous on levels literal, mesmerizingly visual, and metaphorical alike, Depraved is not a mashup, rather a pastiche of essentially all you might hope for it to layer, paste, stick, piece, and yes, oh yes, stitch together — from film and literary references to production values, chronologies, political critiques, and philosophies. Its enigmas run deep. Its puzzles are many. And especially with its setting in Brooklyn, it’s also a holistic embodiment of multiple forms and histories of DIY ‘life.’ But then something different took shape instead. My colleague, Hyperallergic Weekend editor Thomas Micchelli, viewed the film as well. In a brief exchange we had right afterwards, he said that he also found Depraved compelling, and that he had some thoughts about it. So I sent him my initial thoughts in my capsule, and he then had more thoughts. So then what we thought was this: Given that the film itself is all layers and multiplicities of disciplines, inputs, and chronologies, it could be more interesting to present a layered, multiple-voiced exchange between the two of us — a kind of review-qua-pastiche or pastiche-qua-review, not unlike the pastiche that is this film. Below is an edited version of our exchange. — Paul D’Agostino Paul D’Agostino: It seems you too were flooded with thoughts after watching Depraved. Were you also flooded with thoughts as you watched it? I was, and I had so many and jotted them down so sloppily while watching, eyes wide open, in the dark, that at one point I actually turned a low light on my notes to make sure I’d be able to reread them later. I saw already that would be a challenge. Anyway, you too? And what were your initial thoughts, i.e. before I sent you the capsule? And after you read the capsule? Thomas Micchelli: No, I never take notes. I just let my responses pile up, with the hope that the better ones will stick. My reaction to the first frame usually presages my opinion of the entire film, and the first frame of Depraved — the overhead shot of a vinyl LP spinning on a turntable — seemed to be ushering in a movie that would be fatally arch and not terribly original. But this was one of the rare times that the first-frame test failed, maybe because it belonged to a different movie, the five minutes of rom-com tease that you mentioned when we talked on the phone. I did think, though, that the way the overhead shot continued across the half-finished meal and ended in the voyeuristic glimpse through the bedroom doors had a refreshing earthiness to it. We will be getting into the specifics of the movie’s pastiche of every Frankenstein imagining and then some in a little bit, but overall, the film that it evoked most strongly for me was Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012), with the first part mesmerizing and inexplicable, and the second part surrendering to the demands of plot. The first half-hour was especially persuasive — the sound design was brilliant in its ability to communicate the monster’s disorientation in his new world. The use of his point of view, including the deficiencies in his eyesight, was a device that I think could have been used more and explored further. PD: Well, I don’t always take notes either when watching films to review, but I do at least try to jot down quotes that strike me as piquant, revealing, maybe meaningful for what might follow. Or if they’re particularly stupid. Anyway, I like your description of the first-frame test. I should try that. I do something that’s less of a test than a search for an entry into a bit of writing, again if I’m watching something I might review: I look for how much the director has attempted to pull me in, all the way into the visuals and the narrative, in the first few minutes. It’s less of a gauge of the film’s entirety than your method, but useful for me for reviews. At any rate, Fessenden does more in those first five or so minutes than I was prepared for. But I was excited by it. It was a true jolt. As you brought up, the film opens in such completely mundane, maybe rom-com-cum-drama ways, that you’re hardly ready for what’s next. It goes from that slowish pan over some unfinished meals in a living room, into a bedroom where the couple has retreated to burn off dinner with the dessert of coitus, to a moment of happy, maybe post-coitally enlivened chatter in the living room, only to then quickly transition into an argument out of nowhere, punctuated by a claim of, “You keep setting me up to be a disappointment,” barked by Alex, whose identity won’t remain exactly that for very long. All that’s in the first few minutes, after which a brutal murder comes almost out of nowhere, and it is extreme in its immediacy and intensity — i.e. already a different genre of film, in a sense — before then transitioning into some of the near-campy, classic sci-fi-ish, a bit flashy but also not overwrought digital overlays suggestive of electrical pulses and cerebral flashes, and so on. It’s so fast, and so suggestive already of the film’s many layers yet to come. It’s already a pastiche, and it would become much more of one — much like we already know the ‘monster’ is as a ‘thing’ pieced together into ‘life.’ Early on I began thinking of films like Memento (2000) and Primer (2004) as kindred works. Further on I thought a lot about Matthew Barney’s films and art. We can come back to some of that, but I’m interested in what you say about the monster’s eyesight. True, that did come up a lot. Similar in import, and that we can infer as elaborated throughout, was the refrain, “Gravity is your friend,” which were essentially Adam’s — at this point the monster’s name is Adam — first words, to the great astonishment of Henry, Adam’s ‘Dr. Frankenstein.’ TM: I’d like to return to your initial take on the film, its stylistic use of pastiche as a mirroring of Adam’s bodily pastiche. As opposed to a movie by Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, in which the film-geek references are subsumed into the cinematic flow, a pastiche lets its edges show, like the scars on Adam’s body. The citations pull you out of the moment and divert your attention to themselves. The references in Depraved seem out of the blue, such as the twisting camera angle when Adam breaks loose and roams the streets, which brought to mind The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1921), or the close-up of Polidori’s mouth eating a piece of steak, a reference that’s eluding me but I know I’ve seen. (Caligari, which revolves around a carnival barker and an unnaturally tall somnambulist, seems as much of a touchstone as James Whale’s or Kenneth Branagh’s Frankenstein films, especially given the number of times Henry tells Adam how important it is for him to sleep.) There were a number of narrative holes, some that bothered me (there was no setup for Adam’s discovery of his backstory, making it feel rushed and contrived), and others that I found fascinating, such as why Adam has been created out of multiple parts in the first place. If the idea, as we find out later, was to find a way to bring the freshly killed back to life, there seems to have been no need for Henry to sew together an Übermensch, other than to satisfy the director’s desire to make a 21st-century Frankenstein movie. And in that light, the monster’s pastiche of dead parts seems like a critique of the enterprise. Still, I wonder why we are talking about this movie in particular. What makes it compelling enough to single out for discussion? I can’t quite articulate it. PD: Great point. Great points. On the latter one, I suppose we’re discussing it because it offers itself as the direct product of the piecing together, rather than blending, of genres, styles, references, and angles of social critique. It’s true that we could just leave it at: ‘Hey folks, this movie is really good, even fun, and it’ll make you think!’ But then, yes, so do many other films out there to see. But it does make sense, given its internal multiplicity of points of view, its interdisciplinarity, to address the qualities of Depraved from multiple points of view. The film festival presenting it [WHAT THE FEST!? at the IFC Center in Manhattan] seems like it could feature a number of other pictures that have similar efficacy. I can say that it was that latter aspect that initially got me intrigued. Fessender brings quite a mix of experience in filmmaking to the table and has worked alongside many of the greats in indy film, so I was curious to see how an art-horror director whose work is shown at MoMA, and who has worked on projects with Steve Buscemi, Jim Jarmusch and Guillermo Del Toro, to name a few, might handle Mary Shelley’s classic text. There’s also of course a very circumstantial aspect to my interest: I happened to see It’s Alive, the Frankenstein exhibition at the Morgan late last year, and it was exhilarating in so many ways. I could go on, or probably we could both go on for a while about how great it was, but that’s a different review. For now it’s worth noting that I particularly enjoyed the ways the exhibit conveyed the interdisciplinarity of Shelley’s brilliance, and the prodigious wealth of creative enterprise and expression her story has continued to generate. Moreover, one part of It’s Alive! that I found hardest to budge from, in addition to that jaw-dropping suite of paintings by Henry Fuseli, including “The Nightmare” (1781) and “Three Witches” (1783) — and it seems that Fuseli and Shelley’s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, according to the exhibition notes, had some manner of amorous rapport (what a detail!) — was the section detailing the impact of Shelley’s novel on the history of cinema. Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a story that can seem destined to be envisioned and reimagined in so many ways, through so many mediums and genres. In itself it’s everything from allegory to Bildungsroman to gothic horror delving into sci-fi, and so much more. So those are just some of the things that got me intrigued in this movie in the first place, which then got me watching those first five minutes that had me all-in, electrifyingly so. For certain, one thing that’s worth noting before turning to your Übermensch point is that Depraved had me constantly marveling at Shelley’s prescience in telling her story. By way of one of the most effective and broadly transmittable media of her time, she told a kind of pastiche of a tale that could be enjoyed just as well at any single level of its narrative or critique, or at all of them at once, and remain just as cogent, just as potent. To watch Depraved is also to be consistently reminded of the monstrous critical importance of Shelley’s creation. This brings me right to your point about the Übermensch, and maybe also about the critique of the enterprise: PTSD and the wars of the day are regularly dropped into all kinds of films and streaming series these days, not often necessarily or effectively, other than as constant reminders of just how long certain wars, particularly US-led or ‘fed’ campaigns, have gone on. Here, the references to the wars become relevant to the story in ways that make sense — from the variably stilted, jarred, dazed cognitive states displayed by the film’s protagonists and graphic effects alike, to the intuitable critique of the military-industrial complex, so interested in the successful creation of this monster. TM: When Henry says to Adam, “I want you to be safe,” he’s trying to make amends for those on the battlefield he couldn’t save, but he had to deal in death to do it. PD: Yes, he’s working through his own mental trauma. Meanwhile, instigator Polidori seems to simply regard it all as a game, another puzzle for Henry to give Adam to solve in some kind of venture-capitalist-funded experiment in “extreme sports biology,” a telling claim. Also telling is that moments after Henry says to Adam, “I want you to be safe,” we see him tucking Adam into bed by covering him in a blanket that looks a lot like a quilt, which at that early point in the film is also what Adam’s body already looks like — a stitched-together quilt of flesh, limbs, materials, memories, traumas. On that note, I think we’ve covered things well enough. Let’s put this critical monster to bed, and maybe awaken it some other time for some other film or whatever else. In the meantime, let’s test our prescience. Brooklyn DIY trend of the future, ‘artisanal A.I.’?

The Fallowses discuss what they’ve learned from the places their work has taken them — she’s a linguist and he’s a journalist — on this week’s episode of The Ezra Klein Show. During the course of the conversation, Ezra brings up “The Fallows Question,” posed by David Brooks in the New York Times in reference to the globetrotting couple: “If you could move to the place on earth where history is most importantly being made right now, where would you go?” Apparently, in this moment, that place is America. More specifically, American small towns. The Fallowses have spent the past five years visiting towns all over America and speaking to citizens about their lives, what matters to them, and the changes they’re making on a local level to improve their communities — without asking about political identities. A book chronicling their journey called Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey into the Heart of America will be released May 8. Buy Our Towns here: Amazon | Barnes & Noble Ezra usually asks guests for three book recommendations, but because there are two of them, he asks the Fallowses for two books each — they both give three anyway. Deborah Fallows says, “I tend to like to read books that are ... of the place or of the moment where we currently are.” When they lived in Malaysia, she read about colonial life; in China, she read about ancient Chinese culture. While traversing the United States, she read “early, lesser-known adventure stories of Mark Twain,” the journals of Lewis and Clark, and Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. While she admits that Lewis and Clark’s journals aren’t very fun to read, through these accounts of early American life, she found that they were “covering the same territory and seeing the same places” as the travelers she was reading about. Tocqueville particularly resonated with her in his depictions of “how Americans just were at heart.” Fallows doesn’t specify which Twain stories she read, but his travelogue Roughing It, in which he documents a stagecoach journey through the American West, thematically fits. “Just seeing the continuity from those old, kind of dusty writers through to now,” she says, “I found very educational.” Buy The Journals of Lewis and Clark here: Amazon | Barnes & NobleBuy Democracy in America here: Amazon | Barnes & NobleBuy Roughing It here: Amazon | Barnes & Noble Jim Fallows realizes that Ron Chernow’s biography of Ulysses S.

613,613,04-05-17 13:25,2017,5,4,Dylan Scott,Republicans patched together a health care bill. Now it contradicts their own arguments.,"In their rush to patch together a health care bill with enough support to pass the House, Republicans have created a plan with bizarre incentives that undermine the arguments they have used to deflect criticism of the legislation. The final tweak to the American Health Care Act, an amendment offered by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, directly contradicts the defenses that Republicans have deployed for the earlier MacArthur amendment. That amendment allowed states to waive Obamacare’s rule prohibiting insurers from charging sick people more than healthy people — with some conditions. It won over many conservatives but spooked moderates who were worried about rolling back a popular Obamacare protection. The Upton amendment, which adds an additional $8 billion to defray the higher costs people with preexisting medical conditions could face under the AHCA waivers, seems to have been enough to convince wavering centrist Republicans to back the bill and get it through the House. But in doing so, it undermines two arguments Republicans have made in favor of the MacArthur amendment, which created the waivers in the first place: that it would encourage people to stay covered and that few states would really want a waiver anyway. One wrinkle in the MacArthur amendment was that people in a state that received a waiver could not be charged a higher premium based on their health unless they had a lapse in coverage. Some conservatives have argued that this strengthens the incentive for people to maintain coverage, because they would otherwise risk facing higher premiums. Which might have been true, before the Upton amendment was added to the bill. As Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in National Review Online: One advantage of this system over Obamacare is that it would strengthen the incentive for healthy people to buy insurance (since buying coverage would mean also buying the ability to renew that insurance at nondiscriminatory rates). But this new money from the Upton amendment undercuts that incentive. It is specifically designated for people who live in states with AHCA waivers and who face higher insurance costs because they had a lapse in coverage. The new money helps to bring those costs down. People who go without health coverage and then sign up later aren’t going to feel the penalty as harshly or at all. Here’s how Nicholas Bagley, a health law professor at the University of Michigan, put it: If you believe in the MacArthur amendment—if you believe in it so much that that’s what it took to secure your support for the AHCA—the last thing you’d want to do is dilute the penalty for going without coverage. But that’s exactly what the Upton amendment does. “The Upton incentive dulls the incentive that an AHCA waiver would otherwise create to stay continuously covered,” Bagley told me. Other health experts agreed with his interpretation when I asked them about it. “Absolutely,” Tim Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University, said in a brief email. The other argument some Republicans used in favor of the MacArthur amendment is that most states wouldn’t actually pursue a waiver from the Obamacare rule anyway. Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) told me this week that maybe zero states, maybe only a couple, would request waivers. Upton made a similar point on Wednesday, noting that the Republican governor of Michigan had told Upton that his state would not want a waiver. There might be political reasons for that — House Republicans have seen for themselves the blowback you can face for waiving those protections. But as a matter of pure policy, the Upton amendment actually incentivizes states to seek a waiver. The $8 billion in extra funding is only made available to states that have a waiver from the Obamacare rule. So to get that money, you need to get a waiver. “By dangling money, the amendment encourages states to sign up for waivers,” Bagley wrote. If more states took that offer and sought a waiver, it would then make the funding problem worse. Many experts believe that the funding available under AHCA already isn’t enough to make sure people don’t fall through the cracks. The more states that adopt the waiver, the more the $8 billion in the Upton amendment must be spread around, the less money for individual people to help lower their insurance costs. If very few states waive community rating, $8 billion could go quite far. If most states do, it's a drop in the bucket.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/4/15541948/republican-health-care-bill-upton-amendment-incentives,,Vox

Did you hear about ed tech company Chegg losing 40 million records? Or DNA-testing service MyHeritage exposing 92 million records? What about a hacker compromising 27 million accounts at TicketFly?  The situation isn't likely to improve anytime soon either, cybersecurity experts told VICE News. User data has become one of the more sought-after commodities among criminals, and that means breaches of the scale and magnitude we saw in 2018 will continue in 2019. “Data is more valuable than ever, and trading it is so profitable that it makes companies take enormous risks when handling data of the users on their platforms,” said Laura Kankaala, a security researcher at F-Secure, a cybersecurity company based in Helsinki, Finland.  Here are some of biggest data breaches of the year. We’ve already gone through the seemingly endless list of crises the company created and/or weathered in 2018, but its cybersecurity issues warrant greater scrutiny.  Outrage over the Cambridge Analytica scandal — where weak enforcement of Facebook's own policies meant the personal details of 87 million users were misused — might have died down since the story first broke in March. But Cambridge Analytica remains among the most problematic fails for Facebook and could leave the social media giant exposed to a number of lawsuits in 2019.  The company followed that up in October, when it announced that hackers had accessed the most sensitive information from 30 million of its users — including what they searched, their location, and their relationship status.  To close out the year in style, the company announced this month that it may have exposed the private photos of 6.8 million of its users to third-party apps.  To make matters worse, Cher has announced she's quitting Facebook. In a word: no. Tech trends have given criminals — even the rubbish ones — a leg up in the game of cat and mouse with government organizations and global corporations that house your data, experts said.  “Ever more sophisticated tools and techniques for hacking are available for downloading from the web. This means that the number of unsophisticated hackers able to break into systems will rise,” said Suzanne Spaulding, who served as under-secretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the Obama era. Naturally, while hacking gets easier, securing data is only getting harder. And we’re already starting to see that reality, experts said, especially as companies cope with a shortage in available cybersecurity professionals.  “Businesses sorely need cybersecurity companies, because they can't hire full teams themselves, but even the dedicated service providers have issues in scaling to meet demand,” Sean Sullivan, an independent security researcher, told VICE News. The companies who can afford fully staffed, dedicated teams of cybersecurity personnel, Sullivan says, are the likes of Google and Facebook, and as we’ve seen, they’re struggling too.

The Chinese restaurant is one of TGAF's haunts; they affectionately renamed ""#46"" after their favorite dish to eat between sessions at their studio in an artist squat a few blocks away.   Though TGAF is now a force in Paris' next-generation club scene—playing shows all over the city, broadcasting their weekly show on local radio, and debuting mixes on stations like BBC—the collective's beginning was nearly accidental. In 2015, Mayniel was invited to do a Sunday guest spot on French internet radio station PIIAF, and told she could invite friends. Mayniel brought Dexmier, Orliange, and Ferrandiz, who were merely acquaintances at the time. While they came to provide moral support, the other girls ended up hopping behind the decks as co-performers for the hour. The group's chemistry and diverse musical tastes were infectious, and they were soon offered their own show. Now happening weekly, TGAF's Sunday hour on PIIAF is an eclectic mix of pop, experimental music, and house. TGAF's rise over the past few years is happening in tandem with the next evolution of Paris' underground party scene, where the inclusive, DIY spirit of the 90s is making a comeback after years of restrictive legislation and stuffy club culture. ""The parties that represent the best of this spirit [of inclusion] are mostly organized by LGBTQ. That's a fact,"" says Mayniel. TGAF cites parties like  PARKINGSTONE and  I've Seen the Future as prime examples of events that are creating spaces that are both accepting and musically divergent. Paris nightlife has taken many shapes. During the Belle Époque, the city made its name as a center of free expression in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian war. In the 90s, it birthed the distinct French house sound with acts like Daft Punk, and nurtured a vibrant scene of underground raves and clubs like Le Palace and Rex. But in the early 2000s, the scene slipped into a stupor due to noise restrictions, limited opening hours, and gentrification—earning titles like ""European capital of sleep"" from its frustrated club community. It all came to a head in the late-2000s, when a group of promoters, DJs, and club owners started to call for the re-evaluation of restrictive legislation suffocating local club culture. Working with the local government, they established The Council of the Night, which meets to ensure the city's nightlife policies are keeping things both safe and fun. Today, local nightlife is graduating from the dress-shirt-required clubs of the recent past. A more musically and culturally diverse scene is cropping up throughout the city, centered around roving parties where partygoers in sneakers dance to experimental tracks culled from around the world. ""We like clubs that mix several kinds of music. It can be dancehall, RnB, house, techno, different kinds of African rhythms. That's richest thing we can find,"" says Mayniel of what TGAF looks for in a night out. While no scene is perfect, venues are also becoming safer places for POC, women, and the LGBTQ community, with the TGAF crew crediting online communities that allow people to discuss harassment and discrimination without relying on the often unreliable systems set up by clubs and promoters for these problems.  The newfound diversity of the city's after-dark scene affords TGAF a certain amount of freedom—to start a DJ collective nearly by accident, be passionate about both top 40 hits and obscure producers, and focus on the music they make instead of the pronouns they use.   Finishing the last bits of our fried pork, the TGAF crew and I head out into the busy Sunday streets for a tour of all the spots—from their studio in an abandoned high school to local radio stations—that are cornerstones for the next generation of Parisian party goers.  Aurore Dexmier: It's cool because it's in an old building of Paris with kind of modern art stuff, like two staircases and these big windows. It's a big space, and it can get crowded. They have live shows before it turns into a club, and when you play there, the bass is really nice because it's kind of space-y. Musically, it's very open minded. You have techno house stuff—  Nina Orliange: But you can also go to Latino parties [at the club] to dance flamenco. Actually it's weird because you can find this club in guide books, so there's a lot of different people. I never understand the audience.   Pauline Ferrandiz: Sometimes people come because they like the party. Sometimes they're in the neighbourhood and saw the club. It's cheap and it's a good mood. You can chill on the couch or go and dance, and you can get in with sneakers, or drunk.   Marylou Mayniel: We follow DJs and parties, not venues. We discovered the club because the Bye Bye Oceans [a seminal new-gen party] is thrown over there. But it's different from other clubs because La Java already has an established reputation and it's a downtown club that has been there for so many years. So it's a bit harder to gain the owner's trust.  Dexmier: PIAFF is an internet radio like Rinse or something. They are private so they really work to get their slots good, and they have really good intentions. They're a part of a different scene than we are, they listen to different music, which is why they're interested in our show.  Ferrandiz: It's really eclectic and there are lots of talk shows, which is different from a lot of the other online radio stations I listen to like NTS, Rinse, and Radar. You also have writers and journalists doing shows. It's not only a music radio, they are trying to offer lots of stuff.   Dexmier: Piaff likes us for how relaxed we are. It's like listening to your friends on the radio, because sometimes we just talk about what happened last night when we were partying. We're almost gossiping sometimes. It's like a slumber party on the radio. We don't hide that our first crush in life was pop music. Everybody was talking about the show we did on Justin Bieber. Just because we're four girls in this kind of [underground] scene doesn't mean we can't talk about how he's a genius. Orliange: We want to discover things from others. It's about sharing everything.  Ferrandiz: We don't want to be inaccessible. Yes we know things, but we don't know everything, and we don't want people to think we know everything. Like, we aren't music historians. Orliange: But we try to do our best, we're not just chilling like, ""ah I like this,"" and making no sense. We try to do our best to reflect on the music and what it represents. Marylou Mayniel: The building is actually an old abandoned high school, so it's huge and there are many rooms. It was discovered two years ago by some guys who are like some kind of squat masters [ laughs]. They created an association named DOC, and started to look for artists and crews to start flooding the place. Me and two friends applied to create a music space. We got the basement, which is perfect to make noise. For [TGAF], it's a secured place where we can practice DJing whenever we want, or just meet and make music. Mayniel: This venue is cheap to rent for people who want to organize parties with small budgets. The owner of the bar must be quite open-minded, and that's so cool because it's a place where you can find salsa, and the day after, you have some very dark experimental night, and the night after, you have a gay party where everyone is dressed up. Montreuil is a cheap neighbourhood. It's very popular, it's very simple, it's dirty. And the owners are not trying to pimp the place or whatever, but it's big inside.  Ferrandiz: [La Chinois] is important to the Paris scene because it doesn't work as a typical club and requires a certain open-mindedness. It helps to understand that having fun on a Saturday night is not necessarily listening to 135 BPM songs all night. You can also be carried by the atmosphere and the emotion. The music here is always complemented by other artistic dimensions like performance, projection, and scenography.  Dexmier: Unlike the other spots we've been talking about, Rinse is not a place where you can go and play whatever you want, because you have to be invited by Rinse. It's one of the biggest electronic radios in France, so I think for everybody [here] it's the first one to push another side of the club scene in Paris.  Ferrandiz: It's like the reference for club music in Paris. I think the people that run Rinse France are more into house and techno, so the people listening to Rinse France are more interested in house and techno. I like Betty's show because she's into [our] scene and she invites really cool people like DJ Deeon. She was in Girls Girls Girls before. Aurore has a residency now on Rinse, and she was part of the Women's Day thing recently where they had some lectures and live sets [on air].   Dexmier: [Rinse] give attention to small people in Paris trying to do their things, and on my show I get to invite whoever I want. For the Women's Day [program], I was representing TGAF. It was important to connect all the female musicians in Paris.

617,617,22-01-19 17:12,2019,1,22,"Andrew J. Hoffman, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick",The shutdown proves that government is necessary in business," Instead of a debate over the right balance for government, American politicians and others have denigrated government as ""the problem"" or, more recently, ""the swamp."" But as the government shutdown enters its fifth week, Americans are getting a taste of life without government.According to business and public policy professors, it is in the buildup of trash at national parks, longer lines at airport security checkpoints, and the inability to get small business loans, among other effects, that the impact of these services are seen. As the United States endures the longest shutdown in its history, Americans are getting a taste of life without government. The absence of some services are clearly visible, such as a buildup of trash at national parks or longer lines at airport security checkpoints. Others, like those felt primarily by businesses, are less noticeable but arguably more important, such as an inability to get a small business loan or limited service from the IRS, Securities and Exchange Commission, and other key agencies. Collectively they show that government matters. But once the shutdown ends and the memories of the pain and discomfort it caused begin to fade, the visceral reminder Americans got of this message may fade with it. As scholars of business and policy, we believe it's essential that Americans not forget. In fact, the shutdown provides a good opportunity to reflect on the government's vital role in the free market and find a better balance between regulation and business. How the shutdown is affecting business The partial shutdown, in its fifth week, has left about 800,000 government employees either furloughed or working without pay, affecting more than 10 agencies. This has resulted in the slowing or halting of a great deal of activity, including food safety inspections, initial public offerings on the stock market, and the approval of new craft beers. And these costs are felt by citizens as the risks grow to their food, the environment, and other things. Economists warn that long-term impacts could also undermine confidence as businesses, consumers, and investors lose faith in political leaders' ability to make constructive policies. Read more: The warnings are getting starker: Trump's government shutdown is becoming catastrophic for the economy The White House's own economists estimate that every week of shutdown reduces growth by 0.13 percentage point, meaning the economy has already taken a hit of half a percent. If it goes for another week, total costs could exceed US$6 billion, which is more than what the president is demanding for his border wall. And yet Americans won't even know the actual impact because many of the government workers whose job it is to collect and measure economic activity have been sent home. Hamilton and public goods While the shutdown crystallizes what the absence of government feels like, the debate over its proper role in business is as old as the American Republic. For example, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury secretary, wrote eloquently about the need for the government to get involved in markets, specifically through the establishment of a national bank. He called it a key public institution that ""facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among individuals. Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufacturers flourish: and herein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a state."" Beyond a central bank, ""public goods"" often require the protection of a set of laws. Examples include the environment, national defense, national parks, consumer protection, and advanced research that helps seed inventions and create the industries of our future. Author Michael Lewis, in his book "" The Fifth Risk,"" details many of the important yet little-noticed functions that government agencies handle better than private industry, such as the protection of food safety or the oversight of spent nuclear resources. Further, he shows how a functioning economy depends on civil servants using the best data and science available to provide vital services to all Americans. Read more: The government shutdown is now the longest on record and the fight between Trump and Democrats is only getting uglier. Here's everything you missed. To offer just one example of the federal government's positive role in fostering innovation, its creation of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1957 gave us the internet, GPS, stealth aircraft, and countless other technologies used in non-defense sectors today. On the flip side, the absence of proper regulation can lead to serious economic and personal damage, as we saw during the global financial crisis a decade ago. And only government — through regulatory agencies and smartly designed laws — is in a position to prevent another crisis. Indeed, fears are growing that another one may be on the horizon as a result of Wall Street excesses or financial bubbles in housing or debt. The point is that in all these cases, the question is not about ""no government"" but about how much, what kind, and which level (state or federal). Americans' evolving views It's good news in our opinion that Americans seem to be increasingly abandoning the view that government should stay out of business and the market. And more are embracing an expanded role. In 2011, half of Americans polled by Gallup said there's ""too much"" regulation. The latest survey, taken in late 2018, found that just 39% felt that way — the lowest in a decade — with a growing share saying that the balance is ""just right."" This comes at a time when the Trump administration is boasting about the number of regulations it has eliminated. Yet these surveys suggest Americans don't simply want fewer regulations, they want better ones. Even more encouraging in our view is a Cato survey from 2017 that found that large majorities of Americans ""believe regulations, at least in the past, have produced positive benefits"" and that ""regulations can help make businesses more responsive to people's needs."" One area where people see a value in government regulation is the financial sector, which is seen as rapacious and in need of more monitoring. And 1 in 4 Americans surveyed by Gallup said there's ""too little"" regulation, a figure that hasn't changed much in recent years. This suggests that a notable number of Americans don't trust the private sector and think that government is necessary to curb market excess and other problems. Toward a better balance But instead of a debate over the right balance for government, American politicians and others have denigrated government as "" the problem"" or, more recently, "" the swamp."" The terms are meant to say that government is alternatively inept, obstructive, or corrupt. They do this to take advantage of the still too widespread view that government has no role in markets and that regulation represents an unwarranted intrusion on business. This is a misperception that dismays both of us, motivating the very article you are reading. While there certainly are problems with special interest influence in government and bureaucratic inefficiency, the enterprise as a whole remains central to the operation of capitalism and the markets. After all, capitalism is a set of institutions designed by government in concert with business and civil society. As National Affairs editor Yuval Levin points out, even Adam Smith, the Scottish economist who wrote the foundational texts on capitalism, argued that ""the rules of the market are not self-legislating or naturally obvious."" Rather, Smith said, the market is a public institution that requires rules imposed on it. So we believe it is time to return to the basics and launch a new effort at reinventing government to improve how the various branches and levels interact with each other and the market. At the same time, it's important to provide more public education on what government does, and why, and solicit feedback from citizens on how to do it better — including at the ballot box. Andrew J. Hoffman is a professor at the Ross School of Business and School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of MichiganEllen Hughes-Cromwick is a senior economist and associate director of Social Science and Policy at the University of Michigan Energy Institute, University of Michigan.",https://www.businessinsider.com/shutdown-reminder-that-government-is-necessary-in-business-2019-1,,Business Insider
618,618,15-04-16 18:03,2016,4,15,Peter Carroll,Irish MMA’s Road to Regulation,"The tragic passing of Portuguese MMA fighter Joao Carvalho in Dublin on Monday has led to a massive outcry for the regulation of mixed martial arts in Ireland. On Wednesday, Ireland's Minster of State Tourism and Sport Michael Ring made a pledge to regulate MMA in Ireland and today IMMAF have released a call to action, which they hope will bring about the recognition of the sport on the Emerald Isle. Currently, there is no governing body for professional MMA in Ireland, but the Irish Amateur Pankration Association (IAPA) oversees the amateur sport in the country. To gain the IAPA's approval, events must have a full medical staff and an on-site trauma room to cater for any medical issues with competitors. To add to that, IAPA registered fighters get full medicals and blood work done to safeguard amateur participants in the sport. In terms of the professional sport, gaining SAFE MMA approval is encouraged for both promoters and fighters. However, due to the absence of any governing body, there is nothing in place to stop any events that have no gained such verification. At present, the Irish Sports Council does not recognize mixed martial arts, which forced the IAPA to use the term 'Pankration' in their association title. Constituted under the IAWA (Irish Wrestling Association), IAPA have absolutely no authority when it comes to professional bouts. Sport Ireland released a statement on Wednesday, which outlined the criteria for establishing a governing body. Without going into huge detail the applicant should be able to demonstrate that it is a functioning corporate body (M & As, audited accounts, functioning board etc), is affiliated with a relevant international organization, is operating as the governing authority with rules etc and has clubs and memberships around the country. Speaking today, IMMAF President Kerrith Brown claimed that he believes IAPA meet all of the criteria. ""They meet those criteria and more"", said Brown. ""The biggest sports star in the country is Conor McGregor. IAPA are members of IMMAF. They do have high standards when it comes to medical support and care of the athletes. ""They are supported by Professor Dan Healy and he has helped to set the bar very high. The bar is set a lot higher there than in the majority of other places where MMA events are taking place. They are ticking the majority of the boxes."" As Brown also pointed out, the trouble that some governments have with establishing a governing body comes down IMMAF affiliations, or lack there of. ""The problem they are having, and it's a problem that a lot of our federations have, is when they are asked which international body they belong to they say IMMAF. We are still fighting to get recognition from IOC, from SportAccord and we are trying to become signatories to the WADA code. We tick all the boxes too, but there is still a reluctance to engage with the sport at every level."" The professional sport is now at a crossroads on the Emerald Isle. Without a proper governing body established there is no way of safeguarding professional fighters in the country. Despite the death of Carvalho on Monday night, another MMA event is taking place tonight in the Irish capital. Like TEF 1, the event that Carvalho competed in last Saturday, the event is not SAFE MMA approved nor does it have the backing of the IAPA. In terms of creating a government body, IMMAF CEO Densign White believes that the Irish government can recognize and regulate mixed martial arts ""in an instant"". ""It's up to the politicians and it's up to the government,"" said White. ""They can make this happen in an instant. All they have to do is make the decision to recognize the IAPA and the job is done. They can pass a law that doesn't allow MMA to take place outside of IAPA's jurisdiction. That will include professionals too, not just amateur events. ""The Sports Council can allow IAPA to become a sanctioning body. For example, when UFC go to Sweden, the Swedish federation sanctions their events. The same would apply to UFC coming to Ireland if the Sports Council makes the IAPA the sanctioning body."" Due to the gravity of the situation, and Minister Ring's admission that he is ""not a fan of the sport"", Irish MMA might still be a long way from gaining recognition and a establishing a governing body. To establish such a body can take a number of years in Ireland. The lack of regulation is not unique to Ireland, but given Carvalho's death, there is a massive spotlight on the national sport. As rare as the incident involving Carvalho is to MMA, to allow the sport to continue in the same vein is allowing for the same kind of situation to occur again. The scene desperately needs safeguards to established for the professional sport, but for now, Irish MMA remains in limbo.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmqzn5/irish-mmas-road-to-regulation,Sports,Vice

623,623,25-04-18 00:00,2018,4,25,"Karen Freifeld, Eric Auchard",U.S. probing Huawei for possible Iran sanctions violations: sources,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors in New York have been investigating whether Chinese tech company Huawei [HWT.UL] violated U.S. sanctions in relation to Iran, according to sources familiar with the situation.      Since at least 2016, U.S. authorities have been probing Huawei’s alleged shipping of U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, two of the sources said.  News of the Justice Department probe follows a series of  U.S. actions aimed at stopping or reducing access by Huawei and Chinese smartphone maker ZTE Corp to the U.S. economy amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans.      The Justice Department probe is being run out of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, the sources said. John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office, would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the investigation. The probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.  Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications network equipment and the No. 3 smartphone supplier, said it complies with “all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.”  The probe of Huawei is similar to one that China’s ZTE Corp says is now threatening its survival.The United States last week banned American firms from selling parts and software to ZTE for seven years. Washington accused ZTE of violating an agreement on punishing employees after the company illegally shipped U.S. goods to Iran.  ZTE, which sells smartphones in the United States, paid $890 million in fines and penalties, with an additional penalty of $300 million that could be imposed.  U.S. authorities have subpoenaed Huawei seeking information related to possible export and sanctions violations, two sources said. The New York Times last April reported the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control subpoena, issued in December 2016, following a Commerce Department subpoena that summer.  Both companies also have been under scrutiny by U.S. lawmakers over cybersecurity concerns.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China opposed countries imposing their own laws on others, when asked whether Huawei violated U.S. sanctions related to Iran.   “China’s position opposing nations using their own domestic laws to impose unilateral sanctions is consistent and clear,” she told a daily news briefing.  “We hope that the United States will not take actions that further harm investors’ mood towards the business situation there.”  In February, Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, cited concerns about the spread of Chinese technologies in the United States, which he called “counterintelligence and information security risks that come prepackaged with the goods and services of certain overseas vendors.”  Huawei and ZTE have denied these allegations.  Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton have introduced legislation that would block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from Huawei or ZTE, citing concern that the Chinese companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.   In 2016, the Commerce Department made documents public that showed ZTE’s misconduct and also revealed how a second company, identified only as F7, had successfully evaded U.S. export controls.  In a 2016 letter to the Commerce Department, 10 U.S. lawmakers said F7 was believed to be Huawei, citing media reports.  In April 2017, lawmakers sent another letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking for F7 to be publicly identified and fully investigated.  The U.S. government’s investigation into sanctions violations by ZTE followed reports by Reuters (reut.rs/2H3p0Vl) in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.  Reuters also previously reported on suspicious activity related to Huawei. In January 2013, Reuters reported (here) that a Hong Kong-based firm that attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator has much closer ties to China's Huawei Technologies than was previously known.

624,624,28-09-18 11:56,2018,9,28,Ezra Klein,"The Ford-Kavanaugh sexual assault hearings, explained","If you want to know why women don’t come forward with allegations of sexual assault, Thursday’s Senate hearings offered a clue. In the morning, an all-male panel of Republican senators hired an outside prosecutor to try to pick apart Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility live on national television. They refused to subpoena Mark Judge, the key witness, or launch the FBI investigation Ford asked for. And after hearing her testimony, and judging it credible, they simply ignored it. In the afternoon, those same senators feted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the man Ford accused of attacking her. They cut off the prosecutor they hired in order to give speech after speech lamenting the way he and his family have suffered. They said they didn’t question that Ford’s assault was real, but perhaps her memory was flawed; whoever had assaulted her, could she really be trusted to say it was Kavanaugh? But Kavanaugh’s memory was beyond reproach. After calling in professional help to cross-examine Ford, they cut her off when she began to question Kavanaugh, and repeatedly apologized for troubling him and his family with all this mess. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, delivered an unforgettable performance. He was silent during Ford’s testimony, freely yielding his time to prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. During Kavanaugh’s testimony, however, Graham buoyed the witness and ripped into the Democrats. “This is hell,” he told Kavanaugh. The hearings were “the most unethical sham” he’d seen in his decades-long political career. “To my Republican colleagues,” Graham spat, “if you vote no, you’re legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.” But the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings played out in a larger context. Since the dawn of the #MeToo movement, the question has been when the backlash would come, and what form it would take. You could feel it building earlier in the week. The media was reverberating after Ian Buruma, the editor of the New York Review of Books, was fired for overruling his staff and publishing a Jian Ghomeshi essay about how dozens of allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him had unfairly derailed his career. Harper’s published a similar essay at around the same time, and was also pounded for it. The terror that women’s accusations were unjustly ending men’s careers — and that there was nothing men could do about it — was boiling over. But someone needed to take a stand, and be backed up by enough power to survive that stand. In retrospect, it makes perfect sense that President Donald Trump would be the one who would provide the playbook. After all, he’s been the great scourge of the #MeToo moment, the one whose misdeeds have never hurt him. On Wednesday, Trump gave a press conference where he took direct aim at #MeToo. “When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way,” he said. “That’s a very dangerous standard for the country.” That night, CNN reported that a concerned Trump had told Kavanaugh that the time for calm denials was over; he needed to go on offense. So he did. It was the moment the #MeToo backlash truly took shape. If Ford and her husband had never remodeled their house, Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination would have sailed through the Senate. According to Ford’s testimony, she had never told anyone of her sexual assault in detail. That changed in 2012, when she and her husband were redoing their home and she insisted on having a second front door — a second way out of the house. Her husband couldn’t understand; the request seemed ridiculous. Why does a house need two ways out? During a session with their couples therapist, Ford explained, it all spilled out. She had been assaulted as a teenager. She was pushed into a room and nearly raped. Her attacker, whom she recalled then and now as Kavanaugh, clapped his hand across her mouth when she screamed, pushing down so tightly she couldn’t breathe, so tightly she thought he might kill her by accident. He was laughing. His friend Mark Judge was laughing. That’s what she remembers most of all, she says — the laughter. At some point, they tumbled off the bed and she fled the room, locking herself in a bathroom until she heard them go back downstairs and their voices receded. Then she ran from the house, terrified she’d run into them on the way out and the attack would begin again. That’s why she needed a second door in her house, she explained. Because in a moment of trauma, she had needed another way out, and 30 years later, there was still a part of her that couldn’t be comfortable, that couldn’t feel safe, without another way out. That’s why there’s a record from 2012, when her therapist wrote down what Ford said; when her husband first heard Kavanaugh’s name. That’s why her allegation was taken seriously. That’s the story, through tears, that Ford told the Senate and the country on Thursday. “I am here today not because I want to be,” she said. “I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me with Brett.” Ford’s testimony was — by wide acclaim — powerful, specific, and gutting. She was a friendly witness, trying to answer questions, asking repeatedly for an investigation to help clear the holes in her own memory, thanking the committee for the consideration they gave her. Her expertise as a professor of clinical psychology kept shining through as she offered clear, powerful explanations of how trauma worked on the brain, how it had worked on her brain. Mitchell, the prosecutor, largely abandoned the task of questioning the core of Ford’s account. She ended up harassing Ford on points that even Republicans thought minor, like why her fear of flying hadn’t prevented her from taking past vacations, and who paid for a $200 polygraph test. Ford was such a strong witness, in fact, that the fear was she had set an unreachable standard. “Through no fault of her own, she has also reinforced the incredibly high bar of believability,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Anne Helen Petersen: Ford is white, upper-middle class, married, and highly educated. She is calm but demure. She is visibly shaken yet steady. She could afford the therapy that helped document her psychological past. She has a support system and the means to hire a lawyer. Imagine if you lack even one of these qualities. Imagine if your behavior, or your voice, or your face, or the life you’ve lived doesn’t perfectly match what is demanded of the ideal victim. Would you be believed? “Were men out there brought to tears or shaking visceral response by that?” asked New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister. “Because the messages I have from women, and what’s happening in my own apartment, suggest that many many women were.” Even Fox News was impressed. “This is a disaster for the Republicans,” said Fox News’s Chris Wallace. And then it was Kavanaugh’s turn. If Ford did everything — and more — that could be asked of a witness, Kavanaugh did something near the opposite. He entered the hearing with his jaw set and his face flushed. His voice a near shout, he read a long, angry, unflinching, and notably Trumpish statement. “This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,” he raged, “fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record. Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus.” Kavanaugh’s anger worked. Just as Ford fit society’s expectations for a victim, Kavanaugh looked like a man falsely accused: furious, fearful, tearing up when he mentioned his parents or his daughters. He laced into his tormentors, determined to clear his name. He gave no ground. He badgered and interrupted the Democrats questioning him. And in his pain, his outrage, the assembled Republican senators found their voice. Initially, they left their questioning — as they had with Ford — to Mitchell, the outside prosecutor. But after Graham refused to yield his time, choosing instead to apologize to Kavanaugh and cut into the Democrats, so too did every Republican after him. And one after the other, they apologized to Kavanaugh. “Judge, I can’t think of a more embarrassing scandal for the United States Senate since the McCarthy hearings,” said Sen. John Cornyn. The Democrats “have brought us to our worst in our politics,” apologized Sen. Orrin Hatch. “It’s certainly brought us no closer to the truth.” “This could have been handled in such a way that didn’t turn this into a circus, one that has turned your life update down and your family and the life of Dr. Ford upside down,” said Sen. Mike Lee. “I consider this most unfortunate.” But it was Sen. John Kennedy, the final questioner, who truly laid everything bare. “I’m sorry, Judge, for what you and your family have been through, and I’m sorry for what Dr. Ford and her family have been through,” he said. “It could have been avoided.” And then he asked: “Do you believe in God?” Kavanaugh said that he did. “I’m going to give you a last opportunity right here, right in front of God and country,” Kennedy said. “I want you to look me in the eye. Are Dr. Ford’s allegations true?” Kavanaugh looked him in the eye. “They’re not accurate as to me. I have not questioned that she might have been sexually assaulted at some point in her life by someone someplace. But as to me, I’ve never done this.” “None of these allegations are true?” Kennedy asked. “Correct,” Kavanaugh said. “No doubt in your mind?” “Zero. 100 percent certain.” “Not even a scintilla?” “Not a scintilla. 100 percent certain, Senator.” “Do you swear to God?” “I swear to God.” “That’s all I have, Judge,” Kennedy said. And, with that, the hearing was over. The day played out like a set piece. In the morning, Ford showed how high the bar was to even have a chance of being believed. Her story is specific, credible, serious. She’s told it to multiple people over the years. She tried to tell it to Congress before Kavanaugh was nominated. She places Kavanaugh in the town he lived, at the house of a person he knew, in a room with one of his best friends. She tried her best to be polite to the senators, to avoid offense, to show gratitude to the committee for listening to her. She took a polygraph, begged for an FBI investigation. She says she’s 100 percent sure it was Kavanaugh who attacked her. In the afternoon, Kavanaugh simply denied all charges. He denied ever being blackout drunk. He denied ever forgetting anything of importance. He denied the possibility he was wrong, that it might be useful for his alleged accomplice Mark Judge to testify or for the FBI to investigate. He said Ford’s memory had failed her but was incredulous at the idea that his recall could deliver a similar error. And he fought back. He slammed his accusers; he made clear his pain, his rage. If Ford was grateful for the opportunity to be heard, Kavanaugh was incredulous that she was being given that opportunity, that it was taking this long, that it could possibly take longer. Asked why the committee couldn’t take another week to investigate the claims more thoroughly, he shot back, “Every day has been a lifetime.” His suffering was immense, unfair, unforgivable. “I’m never going to get my reputation back,” he said. “My life is totally and permanently altered.” The suffering of his accusers, women who say they’ve been living with the trauma of what he did for decades? They were mistaken, and their claims could be, should be, for the good of the county had to be, dismissed. “This grotesque character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country,” he said. The feminist philosopher Kate Manne coined the term “himpathy” to describe the “tendency to dismiss the female perspective altogether, to empathize with the powerful man over his less powerful alleged female victim.” What Kavanaugh did today was activate the Republican Party’s powerful sense of himpathy: His suffering was the question, and Ford’s suffering, to say nothing of any further search for the truth, slipped soundlessly beneath the water. We ended the day in much the same place we started: his word against hers. But even as everyone agreed Ford’s word was credible, it didn’t matter. There was still Kavanaugh’s word. And it appeared, for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, that that was enough. She was 100 percent sure and he was 100 percent sure, but it was his 100 percent sure that mattered. On this, Trump was right. What Kavanaugh had needed to do was go on the offensive. He needed to remind the all-male Republican panel that he was the victim here, that any of them could be victims, that moving his nomination forward would be a show of strength, a message sent to the Democrats and their allies, a statement that these tactics end here and they end now. This is how you fight #MeToo: by focusing on the pain it’s causing men, by centering their suffering. All of this was, perhaps, predictable. On Wednesday, a new NPR/Marist poll found that while large majorities of Democrats and independents believed Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination should be rejected if Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations are true, a majority of Republicans believed Kavanaugh should be confirmed even if Ford’s allegations are true. If Thursday’s hearing didn’t ultimately seem to be about the truth at all, well, perhaps that’s why: The truth was never really what Senate Republicans were after. By the end of the day, Trump was thrilled. “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,” he tweeted shortly after the hearing ended. “The Senate must vote!”",https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/9/27/17909782/brett-kavanaugh-christine-ford-supreme-court-senate-sexual-assault-testimony,,Vox
625,625,20-11-18 00:00,2018,11,20,,Beijing pioneering citizens' 'points' system critics brand 'Orwellian'," (This story corrects year to 2020 from 2021 in first, third paragraphs)  BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing’s municipal government will assign citizens and firms “personal trustworthiness points” by 2020, state media reported on Tuesday, pioneering China’s controversial plan for a “social credit” system to monitor citizens and businesses.  The system’s rollout has attracted international headlines, sparking comparisons to George Orwell’s novel “Nineteen Eighty-Four”, with critics saying it could massively heighten the Chinese Communist Party’s already strict control over society.  In a roadmap plan released in 2014, China said it would by 2020 create a “social credit system” to reward or punish individuals and corporations using technology to record various measures of financial credit, personal behavior and corporate misdeeds.  But it had not made any mention of using points, as proposed by Beijing’s municipal government in a new plan released on Monday to improve the city’s business environment.  Lists of data, actions and measures will by used to create a trial system of “personal trustworthiness points” for residents and companies in the capital. The term used can also be translated as “creditworthiness” or “integrity”.   The plan did not include details of how the point system would work.   But, it said, information from the system could impact market access, public services, travel, employment and the ability to start businesses, with trustworthy individuals being provided a “green channel” and those who are blacklisted being “unable to move a step”.  “This is an important novel approach by Beijing to assess individuals’ credit and tie it to their whole life,” an unnamed official from the municipal state planner said, according to the Xinhua news agency.      The plan should serve as an example to the rest of the nation for how to improve the behavior of individuals and businesses, Xinhua said.  A second system will also be set up to assess the trustworthiness of government officials and departments by measuring whether contracts and promises are honored, the results of which will be included in performance assessments.  The social credit system, which is being built on the principle of “once untrustworthy, always restricted”, will encourage government bodies to share more information about individual and business misdeeds in order to coordinate punishments and rewards.      Some experts say that the system remains nascent and could help tackle social problems like fraud or food security, as well as noting that punishments are mostly restricted to industry specific blacklists rather than a holistic score.  A system for penalizing individuals blacklisted for such offences as failing to pay court-mandated fines was extended in March. The penalties include banning offenders from making luxury purchases, such as tickets for flights or high-speed rail, for up to a year.

626,626,09-07-19 00:00,2019,7,9,"Tom Daly, Shivani Singh",China's top two smelters sign copper concentrate deals with Antofagasta,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top two copper producers have signed concentrate supply deals with Chilean miner Antofagasta for the first half of 2020, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.    Jiangxi Copper Co and Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group signed the contracts earlier than usual because of concerns about the future supply of copper concentrate, the sources said. Concentrate is partially processed copper ore that is the feedstock used to make refined metal.  Contracts for annual supply are typically not agreed until around the time of the Asia Copper Week conference in Shanghai in November. These early contracts underscore the smelters’ desire to secure concentrate supply as competition for ore increases.  The volume stipulated in the deals is unclear.  “I think early negotiation would be a common way because of the tightness of the (concentrates) market,” one of the sources said.   That supply tightness has pushed treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs), the amount miners pay to smelters to process copper concentrates into refined metal, lower since the start of 2019.  One of the sources put the TC/RCs that Jiangxi and Tongling agreed with Antofagasta under the contracts at $64 a tonne and 6.4 cents a pound, while the second source gave a range of $64 to $70 a tonne and 6.4 to 7 cents a pound.      A Jiangxi Copper spokesman said he was unable to confirm the deal, while Tongling Nonferrous did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Antofagasta did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal working hours.  Both of the sources said the agreed rates were not a TC/RC benchmark for 2020, without elaborating. Discussions on the 2020 benchmark are likely to start at the LME Week event in London in October ahead of a potential settlement at the Shanghai conference.  The 2019 TC/RC benchmark was agreed last November by Jiangxi Copper and Antofagasta at $80.80 a tonne and 8.08 cents a pound, although spot rates have recently plunged to as low as $57 a tonne, the lowest since November 2012, amid rising smelting capacity and disruptions to mine supply.

Read: Facebook has not stopped dark ads from undermining Ireland's abortion vote The result would pave the way for Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution to be repealed and be replaced by proposed legislation which will allow for abortion on request up to 12 weeks. Minister for Health Simon Harris said Saturday that he hopes a bill legalizing abortion would be published by the end of July, and introduced in the fall. “Under the 8th the only thing we could say to women was to take a boat or a flight, now we are saying take our hand,” said Harris. The turnout was also higher than expected and is predicted to top 2 million people (out of 3.3. million registered voters) for the first time in the nation’s history. The turnout was bolstered by the thousands of people who traveled home to vote from all corners of the globe — many of whom raised money for plane tickets by crowdfunding on Facebook. Throughout the campaign there was concern that online disinformation campaigns and dark ads on Facebook would undermine the result, with many experts and lawmakers calling for more regulation for the online space. Under the proposed government legislation abortion on request will be available to women up to 12 weeks and will require sign-off by two medical practitioners, one of which needs to be an obstetrician. The legislation will also require a 72-hour cooling off period before doctors administer an abortion pill. A significant number of lawmakers who campaigned for a No vote have already indicated they are willing to now support the legislation as a result of the overwhelming nature of the result.

628,628,31-05-18 00:00,2018,5,31,Julien Toyer,Socialist chief Pedro Sanchez set to become Spain's Prime Minister,"MADRID (Reuters) - Pedro Sanchez was almost certain to become Spain’s new Prime Minister after his socialist party on Thursday secured enough votes to topple Mariano Rajoy in a confidence vote over a corruption case.  Sanchez has received the backing of six parties totaling 180 votes in parliament to become prime minister, more than the absolute majority of 176 votes needed to take power immediately if the no-confidence vote is held on Friday as scheduled.  Rajoy’s departure would trigger a second political crisis in southern Europe, further unnerving financial markets already wrongfooted by failed attempts to form a government in Italy three months after a national election.  With most Spanish parties in favor of respecting EU fiscal rules, however, investors appeared to see less risk of an abrupt policy shift than in Italy, where parties have thrown doubt on the commitment to the euro single currency.  Spain's blue-chip index Ibex .IBEX closed down 1 percent on Thursday but the news of Rajoy's likely downfall did not trigger a major sell-off and Spanish stocks were also hit by the trade war the U.S. started with Europe and other allies.  Rajoy, who did not attend the afternoon session of the debate on Thursday, ruled out resigning before the vote in a move that would have slowed down the transition.  Shortly before he secured the key support of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Sanchez had told Rajoy it was still time to leave and avoid the humiliation of becoming the first Spanish prime minister to lose a no-confidence vote.  “Are you ready to resign? Resign today and leave by your own will,” Sanchez told Rajoy. “You are part of the past, of a chapter the country is about to close.”  The Basque PNV had backed Rajoy’s budget as recently as last week but it decided to remove its support after dozens of people linked to the ruling People’s Party (PP) were sentenced to decades in prison in a long-running corruption trial.  Sanchez said that if he took power he would stick to the budget approved by Rajoy, and would also seek to start a new dialogue with the restive region of Catalonia.  Defending his record on Thursday, Rajoy told deputies his center-right PP has a wide majority of members who are “decent and honest”.  “The Socialists have left us with a ruined country and we brought back growth and jobs,” he said, adding that Sanchez was trying to put together a “Frankenstein” government that would damage the economy.  Two Catalan pro-independence parties as well as leftist Podemos, a relative newcomer, another small Basque group and a party from the Canary Islands have said they will back Sanchez.  Jose Luis Abalos, the member of parliament in charge of formally presenting the motion on behalf of the Socialists, told PP deputies that the court ruling had triggered a wave of indignation across the country.  “While families were suffering the crisis, you were becoming millionaires,” he told PP members in parliament.  Rajoy, whose minority government has struggled after two inconclusive elections in 2015 and 2016 ushered in the most fragmented parliament since democracy returned to Spain in the 1970s, is also coming under fire for a perceived inability to solve a secession crisis in Catalonia.

Here’s what you need to know about Omar’s tweets and the fallout that ensued. Republicans and some Democrats — including some sitting members of Congress — asserted that Omar’s tweets implied Jewish people used money to control governments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and more top Democrats in the House urged Omar to apologize. The group targeted by Omar, AIPAC, has 100,000 members and a host of prominent donors across the country. Former AIPAC official Steven Rosen once bragged to the New Yorker that he “could have the signatures of 70 senators on this napkin” in 24 hours. AIPAC spends a small amount of money on individual campaign donations, but the group spent $3.5 million on lobbying efforts, according to OpenSecrets. Up until the 116th Congress, Israel’s government enjoyed almost unadulterated support from Congress. But now, Omar and Tlaib’s open stance on the BDS movement has invited a steady stream of backlash for the two lawmakers. Just recently, the Senate voted to penalize businesses that support an Israel boycott. The bill, however, divided Democrats, who are facing pressure by their progressive voting base to be more critical Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.  What are Omar’s supporters saying? Omar responded to the backlash by telling Politico that her tweets “speak for themselves.” Her supporters say that accusations of anti-Semitism are used to undermine legitimate criticisms of Israel and its influence over U.S. politicians.  ""I wouldn't take it as anti-Semitism,” Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, told CNN. “When it comes to issues around foreign policy or comes to issues specifically with Israel, there are a lot of interests, a lot of folks who make campaign contributions based on a person’s position on Israel.” “I know Congresswoman Omar,” he added. “I don’t believe that she would harbor those sorts of views as they’ve been characterized.” Other defenders of Omar — including members of progressive Jewish organizations and Arab American organizations as well as journalists — have said that there’s an Islamophobic undercurrent to attacks against Israel critics. Omar, Tlaib, and former Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, have all experienced numerous controversies related to alleged anti-Semitism. “It’s not controversial to say lobbies influence American politics,” Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of the Jewish Voice for Peace, a pro-BDS Jewish organization, told VICE News. In addition, McCarthy, has himself been accused of anti-Semitism. McCarthy once tweeted that billionaires George Soros, Tom Steyer, and Michael Bloomberg — all of whom come from Jewish families — sought to “buy elections.” Cover image: Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, looks on during a press conference calling for an end to immigrant detentions along the Southern United States border held at the United States Capitol in Washington, DC on February 7, 2019.

631,631,07-07-19 00:00,2019,7,7,"Felix Tam, Farah Master","Hong Kong protesters march again, reaching out to Chinese visitors","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters marched through one of Hong Kong’s most popular tourist areas on Sunday, trying to gain support from mainland Chinese visitors for the city’s opposition to an extradition bill which has caused political turmoil.  Protests against the now-suspended bill have drawn millions of people to the streets in the former British colony in recent weeks, posing the biggest challenge Beijing has faced to its rule in the territory since Hong Kong returned to Chinese control in 1997.  The protests have received little coverage in mainland China, however, with censors blocking news of the largest demonstrations on Chinese soil since the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989.  The bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, has triggered outrage across broad sections of Hong Kong society amid concerns it threatens the much-cherished rule of law that underpins the city’s international financial status.  Hong Kong has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since its return to Chinese rule, allowing freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.  China and Britain have engaged in a public spat over the bill but Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming told BBC TV on Sunday that China was “not interested in diplomatic war with the UK” and he had full confidence in Hong Kong’s ability to resolve the situation without China’s intervention.  Protesters on Sunday braved intermittent rain and marched through streets of Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping destination dotted with luxury shops, to try to deliver their message directly to mainland Chinese tourists in the hope of garnering sympathy.  At times they shouted slogans in Mandarin, mainland China’s official tongue, as opposed to Hong Kong’s main language Cantonese.  They also handed out flyers and sent messages by social media and Apple’s phone-to-phone AirDrop system written in the simplified form of Chinese characters used on the mainland.  The short march finished at the city’s high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland, one of the main entry points for Chinese visitors but a sensitive spot after part of the facility came under Chinese jurisdiction last year.  “It is hoped that Hong Kong people can spread how Hong Kong people can march peacefully and bring the protest information back to the mainland to mainland visitors,” Lau Wing-hong, one of the protest organizers, told Reuters.  The march was the first major demonstration since Monday when protesters besieged and ransacked the legislative building in the heart of the city on the 22nd anniversary of the handover before being driven back by police firing tear gas.   The authorities took no chances. Police and train staff guarded every exit of the station. Hong Kong’s MTR Corp Ltd, which runs the city’s metro, planned to shut all entrances to the West Kowloon station apart from a route for passengers. Food and beverage outlets were also closed.      Online train tickets between Hong Kong and Shenzhen on the mainland were displayed as sold out from 2:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. (0630 GMT-1030 GMT), coinciding with the hours of the protest.  Shanghai businessman Alan Zhang watched the procession near an Apple store on Canton Road.  “Actually, I feel quite touched to see how Hong Kong people fight for their freedom,” said Zhang, 54, a frequent visitor to Hong Kong.  “That’s something we can’t do in China. I think first-time travelers do not know what is happening right now... Indeed it let me see why Hong Kong is different from China. I received flyers and AirDrop - very smart act.”  Hundreds of police lined the route, temporarily closing some roads and diverting public transport.  The organizer said 230,000 people had attended the march, while police put the number at 56,000 at its peak.  By 7:30pm (1130 GMT) most had left, but as the evening wore on several hundred regrouped and marched up a busy street toward the densely populated Mong Kok neighborhood, blocking traffic along the way.  Lines of police with helmets and plastic shields stopped their advance, and worked to disperse the group by driving them back, mostly peacefully. Live TV footage appeared to show a handful of protesters being detained after being wrestled to the ground.  Hong Kong’s Tourism Association said some travel agencies stayed away from Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday.  The extradition bill, which has left Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam clinging to her job, would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city. Protesters want the bill withdrawn altogether.  Lawyers and rights groups say China’s justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention, claims that Beijing denies.   Lam has offered closed-door talks to students from two universities but activists said they want the discussions to be open to the public and called for a halt to investigations of protesters. Police began arresting protesters this week.

632,632,17-12-18 00:00,2018,12,17,Zachary Small,"Mexican Anti-Migrant Video Goes Viral, Before Artists Reveal It as Satire","Last year, a group of artists and activists developed a project satirizing Mexico’s mistreatment of the migrant “caravan” from Central America. When media outlets started broadcasting their satirical video, it triggered an outcry against what many cast as hypocritical racism and bigotry. Does it matter that the video was fake? Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads  Members of the Mexican anti-refugee group “Somos el Muro” (“We Are the Wall”) disagree with President Donald Trump about needing to build a stronger fortification between the United States and Mexico — though not for expected reasons. Instead, the group wants to prevent Central American asylum-seekers from entering Mexico in the first place. In January 2018, the group released a video condemning the migrant “caravan” and pledging to stop refugees in their tracks. Online, Somos el Muro advertises its desire to “end the abuse of our generous system of asylum and refuge” by the “hundreds of thousands of Central American illegals.” Millions have seen the organization’s video call-to-arms, which has been shared widely on social media and news outlets across Latin America. The twist? Somos el Muro is a complete hoax. What began as a New York University-led project commenting on the Central American migrant crisis quickly devolved into an international controversy riffing off of Mexican racism and xenophobia in the face of the 5,000 refugees fleeing gang violence and drug cartels in countries like Honduras. In 2017, NYU’s Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics brought over 30 artists and activists to Chiapas, Mexico for eight days to investigate how the region was dealing with its then-little publicized influx of refugees. Marlène Ramirez-Cancio is an associate director of arts and media at the institute who worked closely with researchers on the Chiapas trip. She tells Hyperallergic that participants worked on two satirical projects: one group created a telethon called “Migratón” while the other built the now-infamous anti-migrant group called Somos el Muro. Inspired by the Yes Men, a collective known for its large-scale political pranks against devious multinational companies, Ramirez-Cancio says that the project groups developed their work as a form of “laughtivisim,” meant to provoke public outrage and response by deploying provocative humor. For the project, NYU actually enlisted the help of Andy Bichlbaum, a Yes Men member who worked hard to co-create and appear in the Somos el Muro video. Accordingly, Somos el Muro endeavored to expose hypocrisy in Mexico. Its creators believed that Mexicans, while critical of President Trump’s anti-immigrant sentiments, also resented the Central American refugees entering their own country. After a delayed post-production schedule, the Somos el Muro video was released on social media in January 2018, but failed to gain much traction. However, the migrant caravan became topical again in autumn of this year when President Donald Trump began using it as a bogeyman to scare Republican voters to the November 2018 midterm election polls. Because of the reignited political chatter, Ramirez-Cancio decided to repost the video online, and subsequently found a captive audience for NYU’s satire. In just two days, she estimates that 1.2 million people watched the Somos el Muro video. In 10 days, that number spiked to almost 2.8 million viewers. Somos el Muro attracted considerably more outrage than most university projects typically garner. And it raised the question: Is a joke still funny even when its punchline gets lost in translation? For many Hondurans, the video was a painful reminder of how their neighboring countries discriminate against their nation. Television newscasters ripped footage offline and played it on the air. Newspapers, magazines, and digital publications across Latin America reported about Somos el Muro as if it were real, even if the group’s website has a very clear page outing itself as satire. La Tribuna, a Honduran newspaper owned by the country’s former president Carlos Roberto Flores, even highlights a counter-movement in the country called “Somos Honduras,” endeavoring to strengthen national identity in the face of discrimination. Mexico’s La Prensa also posted the video on its website before later including a message from Somos el Muro denoting itself as satire. “When we made the video, we didn’t think people would see it as real,” explains Ramirez-Cancio, who points to its sing-along ending that spoofs the 1985 Live Aid anthem, “We Are the World.” Maybe people didn’t watch all the way to the end, she suggests. Ramirez-Cancio is aware of the criticism the institute’s project has received over the last few months. Even if “the racism is real,” as she notes, others have felt that Somos el Muro has merely stoked tensions in the region without a clear indication of humor. Because nuance is dead in the digital age, some people also feared that real radicals in Mexico would take up the phony group’s cause. But Ramirez-Cancio is not convinced. “People say that the internet is so open that all radical positions exist, so satire is always believed as a true position,” she observes, “but I disagree.” “To say that artists should stay in their lane — we need it all. Satire is a way to reveal analysis. Satire is shareable. People will react against it.”",https://hyperallergic.com/475940/millions-believe-an-anti-migrant-video-from-mexico-was-real-until-artists-exposed-it-as-satire/,,Hyperallergic

636,636,28-08-17 15:00,2017,8,28,Mike Piellucci,The Future of EA Sports Is Storytelling,"Like many great strategies, EA Sports' plan to take sports games into the future was born of necessity.  It was 2009 and Cam Weber was working on  Fight Night Champion, the fifth installment of EA's boxing franchise. It was scheduled to arrive at a volatile time. The sport itself was stagnant, with the upstart mixed martial arts scene siphoning its audience and nothing beyond the faint and ever-receding flicker of a Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao megafight for boxing to market as a mainstream draw.  But the mythology of the sport remained strong. The next winter, David O. Russell's  The Fighter would garner seven Academy Award nominations and two wins. Soon after, FX would premiere  Lights Out, a critically acclaimed, albeit ultimately short-lived series about a fighter with pugilistic dementia. There were only the latest examples of the sweet science's resilience within popular culture. Weber decided that his team needed to pivot accordingly.  ""We were forced into this place where [we said], 'You know what? For the good of the  Fight Night franchise, what we need to do is we need to build our own blockbuster Hollywood boxing movie and let you play through it,'"" Weber says now. Fight Night Champion dropped in March 2011. Its centerpiece was the game's namesake, a first-of-its-kind story mode called ""Champion"" in which the player shepherds a fictional boxer named Andre Bishop out of prison and up the ranks as a heavyweight championship contender. Looking back, Weber calls it ""fairly static,"" an almost rote interspersing of cut scenes and boxing matches. It was a start, though, and as the game earned critical praise, Weber began to see ""Champion"" as a blueprint for where the industry could go.  ""I was convinced this was the future of sports games,"" he says.  Seven years later, Weber is a Senior Vice President in charge of overseeing development at EA Sports. His once-distant future of narrative gameplay in sports titles has become present-day reality for the largest sports video game company in the world. Last year,  FIFA 17 debuted ""The Journey,"" which chronicled the rise of Alex Hunter in the English Premier League. It was a hit: According to EA,  FIFA 17 was the highest-selling console game in the world last year, and Alex Hunter is back for another run in this year's edition.  Now, on August 25th, the company will reveal its greatest statement of intent yet.  Madden NFL 18 hits shelves with the usual roster tweaks and gameplay adjustments expected of EA's flagship football title. The star of the show, however, is ""Longshot"", a multi-hour campaign mode about two football players from small-town Texas arriving at the NFL Draft Combine to chase pro football dreams.  At first blush, it's exactly what you would imagine a story catering to a die-hard football audience to be about, right down to casting Scott Porter—best known  Friday Night Lights' Jason Street—as Colt Cruise, a Wes Welker-esque slot receiver with a drawl. Meanwhile, both Weber and  Madden's creative director, Mike Young, are not shy about the ""Longshot"" narrative also being a vehicle to deliver heavily demanded gameplay modes like the NFL Scouting Combine and 7-on-7 football into the series for the very first time. This is catnip to hardcore fans, in other words, a story that can be just as accessible as it needs, whether the audience truly wants to invest in the narrative or simply use as a means to an end. But ""Longshot"" is also the type of story that Young says was inspired by games like  The Last of Us and Telltale's The Walking Dead series. When he gathers feedback from testers, Young says the two words he hears most often are ""emotion"" and ""relatable."" There are branching storylines and quick-time events and dynamic cutscenes. It is a Telltale game tucked inside the greatest football behemoth on earth, making this year's  Madden the sort of gaming experience that many longtime devotees have never been exposed to. The endgame is a push and pull between familiarity and ingenuity—and, most crucially, the sports video game industry's best hope at escaping the Catch-22 it's battled since inception. No other genre is so handcuffed to the wider reality it tries to portray. Rosters must be note perfect, as well as constantly updatable. Gameplay needs to reflect exactly what takes place on the field or court or pitch each weekend. Franchise modes encompass every shred of salary cap minutiae. There is little room for innovation and even less margin for error. Sports fanatics will stand for nothing less.  Nevertheless, scores of fans flit in and out each year, content to sit out an edition or two if they sense that a franchise has stagnated. EA is hardly naïve to that reality—""As developers we're always frustrated when fans say, 'Oh, this year's skippable. There's nothing really that great,'"" Young says—but only so much could be done. There's a reason why  NFL and  NBA  Street became their own franchises instead of a  Madden or  NBA Live subset: Creep too far outside the box in a simulation game, and things skew toward the inauthentic. Narrative gameplay like ""Longshot"" gives EA a shot at having its cake and eating it, too. The simulation gameplay isn't going anywhere; if anything, Weber says, the most common complaint coming out of ""The Journey"" was it leaned  too much on action at the expense of the story. But as it continues to tweak the narrative formula, EA Sports can position itself to say, with a straight face, that every installment of every franchise is a must-own. ""It's brand new content for people every single time,"" says Weber. ""This new narrative that everyone knows is something new you can get in the game each year, I think that's very powerful for us."" Then there's the crossover appeal. Here, Young harkens back to Porter's days on  Friday Night Lights, a show that garnered admiration from football fans and novices alike. ""My wife… grew up in Pittsburgh and somehow doesn't care about the Steelers,"" Young says, and yet she became an  FNL fanatic thanks to the plotlines and relationships that orbited around the sport.  ""Longshot"" was created with the same ethos in mind. As a game that tend to find its audience among—and be marketed to—young men, ""Longshot"" offers something to players that might be left cold by the call of ""Madden Season."" Already, Young is floored by the number of male gamers who have told him that they can't wait to dive in with their spouses—""and if you work in this industry and you work in a sports video, most people's wives could care less what you do."" If nothing else, he reasons, it gives EA a new tool in their arsenal with which to sell  Madden. ""It's like a movie trailer,"" Young says. ""'Oh man, I'm going to experience that this season?' If we can get there, it gives people that bigger emotional reason to come versus when you sell someone a new iPhone, you're listing a bunch of bullet points. That's not usually that emotional."" Altogether, story modes present the sort of sales potential that makes EA's expenses along the way almost immaterial. It's why EA spent three years integrating its Frostbite 3 engine to power those narratives along, with the sort of speed that leads Young to claim that ""Longshot"" won't feature a single loading screen.  It also explains ""Longshot's"" seven-figure budget, which supported a filming schedule spread across 45 sets and features a 45-person cast, including Porter, Academy Award-winner Mahershala Ali, and J.R. Lemon—a former Stanford running back and a current cast member on NBC's  The Night Shift—playing Devin Wade, ""Longshot's"" protagonist. Seven years after  Fight Night Champion and four since Young initially conceived of  ""Longshot,"" EA is no longer in the business of parroting sports movies. For all intents and purposes, they're now making their own.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kk7y8/the-future-of-ea-sports-is-storytelling,Games,Vice

The New York billionaire lost the Wisconsin Republican primary on Tuesday to Cruz and is seeking to rebound in New York on April 19. He won the backing on Thursday of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was irked by Cruz’s values comments.  “It’s New York City. We’re family. I can make fun of New York but you can’t,” Giuliani, who led the city through the trauma of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, told the New York Post.  “I support Trump. I’m gonna vote for Trump,” he said.  Ohio Governor John Kasich, running third in the Republican race, chimed in with an ad called “Values,” part of a seven-figure ad buy in New York and Pennsylvania, which votes on April 26.  “New Yorkers aren’t stupid and they certainly won’t fall for Ted Cruz’s lame soliloquies and flattery after he slammed their values,” said Kasich spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp.  Trump canceled a Friday trip to California to focus on New York. He turned on Cruz Wednesday night during his first rally in the state since the double-digit loss in Wisconsin.  “I’ve got this guy standing over there, looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn in his face, with hated, with hatred of New York,” Trump said, drawing a chorus of boos.  Cruz credited his Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses victory in part to  his attacks on Trump’s “New York values.” He told ABC on Thursday the phrase referred to the state’s liberal Democrats.  Cruz took another hit in the Bronx, where a group of high school students protesting his stance on immigration threatened a walkout if their principal did not cancel his appearance.  “Most of us are immigrants or come from immigrant backgrounds. Ted Cruz goes against everything our school stands for,” Destiny Domeneck, 16, told the New York Daily News.  School authorities complied, the newspaper reported on Thursday.

642,642,30-01-18 00:00,2018,1,30,Elena Goukassian,The Enterprising Illusionists of 19th-Century Spirit Photography,"What does the continuing popularity of books about 1850s spiritualism and ghost photography say about us today? Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In the mid-1800s, with Spiritualism at its height in the US, a photographer named William H. Mumler started creating spirit photographs, duping the people of Boston (and New York) into believing that the ghosts of their loved ones appeared standing next to them in studio portraits. At the height of the Civil War, with many losing family and friends on the battlefield, Mumler’s spirit photographs became a sensation, even at the wholly unreasonable price of $10 per siting (about $300 today). Peter Manseau’s The Apparitionists: A Tale of Phantoms, Fraud, Photography, and the Man Who Captured Lincoln’s Ghost tells Mumler’s story along with the tangental and interconnected tales of a whole cast of characters, each more intriguing than the next — including a smattering of mediums, Mary Todd Lincoln, charlatan extraordinaire P.T. Barnum, Samuel Morse (inventor of Morse code), and fellow photographers and sometimes rivals Jeremiah Gurney, Mathew Brady, and Alexander Gardner. The book paints a compelling social landscape of what appears to have been a golden age of the swindler. Although the writing is at times self-indulgent — the narrative jumping back and forth in time with each dozen-page chapter and Mumler’s 1869 trial for fraud appearing in the form of a transcript fit for a movie — the extremely well-researched and fascinating stories that come out of it leave the reader wondering how people could have possibly been so easily tricked by what we now know to be double exposures and other very simple methods of photographic manipulation. Of course, photography itself was still in its infancy, and when you add grief and Spiritualism to the equation, there’s no telling just how far the human mind is willing to go to make some sort of sense out of the afterlife. Even 150 years later, we’re still dealing with some of these same issues, which perhaps is why there’s been such a resurgence in interest in spirit photography in the past several years. Like during the Civil War, we live in an age of new technologies transforming the means of communication, allowing for a malleability of truth at a time when politics are again dividing families into polar opposite factions. A need for a new kind of faith coupled with a skepticism of previously undebated scientific theories (medicine included) has opened up a renewed interest not only in the Spiritualist histories of the past, but in some cases, even created a kind of continuation of its practices. In an extreme example, when entrepreneur Eugenia Kuyda’s good friend, Roman Mazurenko, died suddenly in 2015, she felt an urge to keep talking to him, so she created a bot she could text with by programming in hundreds of text messages Mazurenko had sent to family and friends over the years. If this trope sounds familiar, it’s because Kudya took inspiration directly from an episode of the British TV show, Black Mirror, in which a widow communicates with a simulacrum of her recently deceased husband, taught to speak like him through uploads of all of his digital interactions (both public and private). As Kuyda’s endeavor proves, even when we intellectually know that we’re not actually communicating with the dead, there’s still something in us that keeps up the ruse. This may also explain the sudden rise in popularity of occult practices like aura photography, which is always noted with a “For entertainment purposes only” disclaimer. And going back to the 19th-century, when Mumler was acquitted for a lack of evidence in a trial accusing him of manipulating images, Manseau leads the reader to believe the victory was at least in part due to emotional client testimony that the photographer had truly helped people in a time of need. Sometimes, even when we know we’re taking sugar pills, the placebo effect is just enough to keep us going.

643,643,10-05-17 00:00,2017,5,10,Keegan Hamilton,North Korea learned how to test nukes from the U.S.,"North Korea tests its nuclear bombs in a valley beneath a cluster of mountain peaks about 370 miles northeast of Pyongyang. And at least three times over the past month, teams of soldiers at the heavily secured compound have been spotted playing volleyball. The games, captured by commercial satellites passing high above, have generated headlines around the world — and more than a few “Top Gun” jokes. But the workers at the remote testing site have been busy with far more than just leisure activities. Satellite imagery of the site, which is named after the nearby village of Punggye-ri, has revealed signs of fresh tunneling, new equipment, and other activities known to have preceded North Korea’s five former nuclear tests, two of which occurred last year. President Donald Trump says he wants the tests stopped, but the Kim Jong Un regime appears to have no intention of letting up. And Jeffrey Lewis, who leads East Asia research at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, says there’s evidence that North Korea “will probably conduct one or two nuclear tests every year for the foreseeable future.” “They’ve started economizing and building basically underground test centers where they can do many, many tests,” Lewis said. “And that suggests something distressing about their aspirations. They’re in this for the long haul.” That forecast is based in part on the discovery that North Korea likely copied the design of its nuclear testing site from the United States. Lewis is one of a handful of open-source sleuths who use satellite imagery, seismological data, propaganda photos, and other publicly available information to study North Korea’s development of weapons of mass destruction. Last year, when mapping the precise locations of North Korea’s previous underground nuclear tests, he and his colleagues noticed something peculiar: The layout of the tunnels almost perfectly matches the configuration at the Nevada National Security Site, where the U.S. conducted many of its own nuclear tests.

Last year, when mapping the precise locations of North Korea’s previous underground nuclear tests, he and his colleagues noticed something peculiar: The layout of the tunnels almost perfectly matches the configuration at the Nevada National Security Site, where the U.S. conducted many of its own nuclear tests. “I would be shocked if this was a coincidence,” Lewis said. “The U.S. has done more than a thousand nuclear tests, and very many of those were underground. That data is freely available. And my suspicion is the North Koreans make good use of that data.” The government has indeed declassified info about America’s old nuke tests; there are even books on Amazon that describe how the underground tunnels were designed and spaced to keep nuclear blasts safely contained. In North Korea, each test creates a small earthquake, and there are standard formulas to calculate the distance between underground explosions using seismic readings. Lewis and his team created interactive 3D maps of Punggye-ri’s tunnels [see below] and overlayed them with the U.S. setup in Nevada. “It turns out you could almost perfectly just drop it right on top,” he said. Kim Jong Un’s father began building the Punggye-ri site in the early 2000s, razing several small villages in the process. The site originally had just one tunnel, but now, Lewis says, it’s “basically a base camp surrounded by big mountains with three tunnels going into different mountains.” The test site is one of the most closely watched pieces of real estate in North Korea, with intelligence agencies and open-source researchers scrutinizing satellite photography on a near-daily basis for clues about the likelihood of another test. Some of the most influential observations come from 38 North, a website affiliated with Johns Hopkins University. When experts Joe Bermudez and Jack Liu wrote in April that the site appeared to be “primed and ready” for another test ahead of a major North Korean holiday, news outlets around the world, including VICE News, picked up the story, which turned out to be a false alarm. Bermudez, who is based in the Denver area, says crying wolf is “one of our biggest concerns.” He maintains that it appears “everything has been done should they want to conduct another test,” but it’s basically impossible to predict when that will happen. “That decision is in one person’s hands and one person’s alone: Kim Jong Un,” Bermudez said. “He has to sign a special order for the test to be conducted. He could wake up this morning and say ‘Go.’ He could wake up this morning and say ‘No, let’s wait until the U.S. tones down its rhetoric and the U.S. aircraft carrier leaves the area, and once they leave, we’ll pop the nuke.’” Bermudez used to work for the government in some capacity — he’s cagey about his exact role — and has studied North Korean defense and intelligence affairs for more than three decades. He was the one who noticed the recent volleyball matches. The sport, he pointed out, is popular across North Korea and not unprecedented at the testing site, with games observed there as far back as 2006, shortly after the first underground blast. In a Skype chat, Bermudez shared his computer screen with VICE News and spent 45 minutes using two high-resolution satellite photos to explain the layout of the testing site and point out some oddities that can be observed from space. For instance, there are several greenhouses inside the compound because workers are expected to grow some of their own food. “They’ve actually started planting for spring,” Bermudez said. He can’t see into the greenhouses, but he uses software that manipulates the image to highlight vegetation. After a few clicks, the opaque image of the greenhouse is full of little pink spots. “What we’re probably seeing in this pinkish shade is the beginning of seedlings that are being grown under the plastic,” he explained. Bermudez also noted a row of bright white dots near the volleyball courts he suspects are propaganda placards. He says there appears to be a fresh coat of paint on them, a sign that a test could come soon. “Before a major event or a visit by a senior official, they’ll have what we call a beautification program, and this is part of it,” he said. Other indications include the presence of machines that pump water out of the testing tunnels, and the accumulation of equipment piled up under tarps and canopies. The North Koreans know they’re being watched from space and frequently try to hide their work and confuse outside observers.  Bermudez wrote that a recent day of bustling activity at the site — including plenty of volleyball — was likely a “deception and propaganda effort” to fuel curiosity and concern about the likelihood of another nuke test. If that was the true intent, it worked like a charm. After the frenzy of media coverage generated by Bermudez’s 38 North posts in April, Trump weighed in, saying he would “not be happy” if Kim orders another nuke test and wouldn’t rule out taking military action in response.  Lewis doesn’t like predicting when the next test will occur. But based on his research, it appears North Korea has enough space underneath the mountains to dig more tunnels and conduct many more nuclear tests. So far, the explosions have been relatively small; the largest was estimated to be roughly the same size as the one generated by the bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima — though Lewis suspects the depth of the blast may have concealed its true size. Based on the designs North Korea borrowed from the U.S., Lewis says it appears the regime has the capacity to detonate a weapon about 10 or 20 times more powerful than what they’ve done thus far. “It’s pretty clear,” Lewis said, “that they plan to do a lot of nuclear tests.” Ravi Somaiya and Amel Guettatfi contributed reporting.",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/434mnm/north-korea-learned-how-to-test-nukes-from-the-u-s,,Vice News
644,644,25-09-16 12:00,2016,9,25,Andrew Nunes,Neon Plasticine Paintings Are a Wild Welcome to the Jungle," The innate psychedelia of the human subconscious meets a ritualistic exploration of nature in British artist Henry Hudson's Sun City Tanning, on view at S|2, Sotheby’s contemporary art gallery. The artist’s debut exhibition in New York consists of eight enormous, hallucinatory paintings of nature that border fact and fiction through their surreal hues and overabundance of minute, dream-like detail. The striking exoticism in these landscapes feel like a child’s imagining of what a jungle may be like, if said child had extraordinary painting talent and an incredible artistic vision.  Made of plasticine, a malleable material somewhat similar to Play-Doh, the paintings have a tactility and three-dimensional quality that vastly departs from your typical flat wall work, adding a sensation of depth that tempts the viewer to enter the luscious landscape depicted. Although the use of plasticine in these paintings feels beyond appropriate, Hudson has worked with the material extensively throughout his career and it is perhaps more of a ‘signature technique’ than a specialized choice for this particular series, although the result is a harmonious synchrony either way.  Regarding his fervent affair with plasticine, Hudson believes he is simply doing what any artist must do: “I really believe that artists are curious characters, and that if something is picked up, especially in the studio, it should be pushed, studied, explored, burnt, punched, pulled apart, had the elements thrown at it, smoothed, squashed and turned on its head until you’ve both had the most passionate marriage of love and hate,” Hudson explains to The Creators Project. “I'm still married too it it's a simple as that. When I'm done I doubt I'll divorce it. I'll probably just put it in a corner to collect dust.”  Although the press release describes Hudson drawing inspiration from shamanistic rituals for this body of work, the artist himself has never had personal contact with shamans. Yet this isn’t necessarily a lack of authenticity; it’s a longstanding continuation of the myth of the artist: “I looked at Henri Rousseau’s work and became aware that he never went to the jungle, despite the myth that he had fought tigers there. Joseph Beuys never crashed his plane nor was wrapped in honey and cloth by natives (no evidence),” Hudson tells The Creators Project. “Does this change the way we look at their work? I’m interested in the myth and the experience the viewer has with or without this knowledge. Does it lessen our emotional response or heighten it?”  Sun City Tanning will be on view at S|2 until October 14th, 2016. More of Henry Hudson’s plasticine works can be found here.

645,645,12-03-18 15:00,2018,3,12,Tara Golshan,Congress has until March 23 to fund the government,"Without an appetite to actually legislate in the midterm election year, Congress still has a job to do: keep the government open. Lawmakers have to pass a spending bill by midnight March 23 or the government will run out of money and shut down — again. The government has already shut down twice this year. The first shutdown came in January and lasted for three days, during a standoff over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Then in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) effectively shut down the government himself, this time only for a few hours overnight, in a stand against a deal negotiated by congressional leaders that would bust the government budget caps on domestic and military spending that have been in place since 2013. Now it’s government shutdown season again. Having kicked down any permanent solution to government spending since September 2017, and currently on their fifth short-term spending bill, Congress appears to be working toward a more permanent funding package to carry them through to the start of the new fiscal year on September 30. Already there’s been some head-butting between the parties. Republicans are trying to slip in conservative priorities — like defunding Planned Parenthood — and Democrats are pushing for a liberal spending agenda, prioritizing non-defense spending programs. While Democrats don’t have control of either chamber, they can block funding through a filibuster in the Senate. Republicans need at least nine Senate Democrats to sign on to their spending agenda for it to pass. Meanwhile, there’s still a big question mark over what the White House will sign on to. Over the weekend, President Trump called for the spending bill to defund “sanctuary cities,” which Democrats will almost certainly oppose. But the calls in Congress for another government shutdown have quieted. Democrats seem fine with leaving major policies, like immigration and gun control, out of the government spending deal. And for now it’s just a final sprint for lawmakers to hammer out a deal. In February lawmakers set themselves up to reach a more permanent spending agreement by the end of March. Congress agreed to massive increases to domestic and defense spending over the next two years, raising funding for domestic programs by $128 billion and hiking defense budgets by $160 billion. Since passing the budget deal, appropriators — the lawmakers in charge of the nation’s purse strings — have been negotiating how to actually allocate the money. Congress has three options before March 23: 1) Congress will have passed a long-term spending bill. This would come in the form of an omnibus, which jams together 12 individual appropriations bills into one massive funding package. Senate and House appropriators have been working to write the omnibus over the past several weeks, but there are still policy hang-ups. As Vox’s Dylan Scott explained, House Republicans are pushing to fully defund Planned Parenthood, which has long been attacked by conservatives for performing abortions at some of its clinics, by blocking Medicaid and several other federal funding sources from going toward the organization. This is a nonstarter for Democrats and will likely be a major point of contention as lawmakers continue to negotiate the specifics. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also cited concerns with some appropriations requests for Homeland Security but did not go into details. At a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Trump also made a call to defund sanctuary cities in the funding bill — which would be a nonstarter for Democrats. How far that demand goes in Congress remains to be seen. 2) Congress could buy itself more time. Lawmakers also have the option to give themselves another extension on the government shutdown deadline. By passing a short-term bill — a continuing resolution — Congress would be keeping spending levels at the status quo. Already, rumblings among congressional staffers hint that negotiations could come down to another CR (It’s not clear how long a stopgap funding bill that could be). It would be the sixth stopgap spending bill this fiscal year — a reality that’s increasingly frustrated lawmakers, especially those with defense interests who say the military cannot properly plan its resources on short-term spending bills. 3) The government shuts down. Three government shutdowns in one year would certainly be historic. This would be the result of a complete failure in negotiations, or it could even come from the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are likely much less eager go down that path, especially as we creep closer to midterm elections. But Trump has not shied away from threatening a government shutdown in the past, once even calling for one in order to get a win on his policy priorities. Behind both government shutdowns this year was a policy fight unrelated to government spending: immigration. In January, Senate Democrats, frustrated with Trump’s unwillingness to accept a bipartisan proposal to address the nearly 700,000 immigrants in legal limbo under DACA, orchestrated a shutdown with the support of some Republicans. The result was a failed and inconclusive Senate floor debate on the issue. Again in February, a conservative revolt over the budget deal meant that House Republicans, who have a big enough majority to pass legislation without Democratic support, suddenly needed votes from across the aisle. Rand Paul shut down the government, and House Democrats had to decide whether they would sign on to reopening it without any gains on immigration. Ultimately, House Democrats voted for the final bill. Now Democrats seem to have changed their tune and seem less interested in tying immigration, or any big policy priorities, like gun control, to the spending fight. Immigration “doesn’t have to be on the omnibus bill,” Pelosi said this week. “But the omnibus bill has other problems in it.” Trump has some immigration priorities of his own, however, calling on Congress to defund “sanctuary cities.” “Today I am calling on Congress to stop funding sanctuary cities so we can save American lives,” Trump said at a rally over the weekend. “The funding bill should not give precious and massive taxpayer grants to cities aiding and abetting criminals.” It’s not clear whether the White House will veto the spending bill over the measure, which will surely lose Democratic support. Ironically, some Senate Republicans, like South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito, said the omnibus could see a short-term legislative extension of DACA in addition to some border security. ”That’s probably the most likely thing — when we write the funding of the government bill, we’ll extend DACA legislatively, making it legal for a year or two and kind of punting it,” Graham told reporters. But the way things are going so far, even that might be too hopeful.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/12/17100660/congress-government-shutdown-spending,,Vox

What began as a peaceful protest through the centre of the global financial hub descended into violence early on Monday as several hundred protesters clashed with police, who responded with pepper spray before the standoff ended soon after.  The protests plunged Hong Kong into a new political crisis, heaping pressure on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s administration and her official backers in Beijing. Veteran lawmakers have called on her to resign.  The rendition bill has generated unusually broad opposition, from normally pro-establishment business people and lawyers to students, pro-democracy figures and religious groups.  Sunday’s demonstration capped weeks of growing outrage in the business, diplomatic and legal communities, which fear corrosion of Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and the difficulty of ensuring basic judicial protections in mainland China.  Lam sought to soothe public concerns and said her administration was creating additional amendments to the bill, including safeguarding human rights.  “This bill is not about the mainland alone. This bill is not initiated by the central people’s government. I have not received any instruction or mandate from Beijing to do this bill,” she told reporters on Monday.  She said the bill would have a second reading debate on Wednesday.  Organisers put the size of Sunday’s crowd at more than a million, outstripping a demonstration in 2003 when 500,000 took to the streets to challenge government plans for tighter national security laws.  Police put the figure at 240,000 at the march’s peak.  Many thousands were still waiting to join the march from Victoria Park on Hong Kong island on Sunday as tens of thousands of others reached the Legislative Council building in the Admiralty business district.  About 1,000 people joined a protest in Sydney and another protest was also reported in London.  Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung said on Monday the government had improved the entire proposal to show it had been responding to social demands.  “I hope that in the Legislative Council, everyone can continue the discussion in a frank, peaceful and rational way and continue to follow up on this matter,” Cheung said.  U.S. and European officials have issued formal warnings, matching international business and human rights lobbies that fear the changes would dent Hong Kong’s rule of law.  The former British colony was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997 amid guarantees of autonomy and various freedoms, including a separate legal system, which many diplomats and business leaders believe is the city’s strongest remaining asset.  Guards removed damaged barricades from the front of the Legislative Council building during Monday’s morning rush hour and cleaning staff washed away protest debris.  All but one protester had been cleared from the area, with residents back to work as normal.  Hong Kong newspaper Mingpao said in an editorial the government should take the protesters seriously and that pushing the legislation forward would exacerbate tensions.  The official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Monday “foreign forces” were trying to hurt China by creating chaos in Hong Kong.  “Any fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong’s rule of law and deliver justice,” the mainland paper said.

651,651,14-11-18 18:56,2018,11,14,Tara Golshan,Kevin McCarthy has been elected as the new House minority leader,"California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy is moving on up. House Republicans elected McCarthy, the current No. 2 House Republican majority leader, to lead the conference as the new minority leader, in a Republican-only vote on Wednesday. When House Speaker Paul Ryan announced his retirement in April, McCarthy was largely seen as his natural successor. With Democrats in the majority and no Republican speakership position to fill, McCarthy didn’t have much of a fight to get the top post. Only one other Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a conservative firebrand who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, made a bid for the spot, but he couldn’t amass enough support to wage a real challenge. McCarthy’s ascension is a sign that Republicans remain comfortable with the establishment — despite the fact that Democrats flipped the House by campaigning on the failures of the Republican agenda, which McCarthy helped establish. With Democrats in control of the House, McCarthy now faces a clear choice: He will either have to find middle ground with his colleagues across the aisle, or accept that the Republican agenda will be put on pause until they regain the majority. McCarthy is an established name in Washington. He has held a seat in the House since 2007. Before that, he served as the minority leader of the California State Assembly, a position he was elected to as a freshman state lawmaker. Unlike Ryan, McCarthy is not someone known to lead a policy debate, but on Capitol Hill, he’s well-liked and persuasive. He’s a strong fundraiser, and as someone who always said Republicans would stay in control of the House in 2019, he managed to convince his fellow Republicans that sticking with the party’s agenda was a winning strategy — to his own undoing, ironically. His ambitions to lead House Republicans have been clear since 2015, when he ran to replace the embattled retiring Speaker John Boehner. But his campaign was short-lived; rumors of an affair with a colleague, overtly bragging about how Benghazi investigations tanked Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers, and an arch-conservative revolt from the House Freedom Caucus pushed McCarthy to step behind Paul Ryan instead. At the time, a cohort of conservatives, then led by Jordan, found McCarthy too close to Republican leadership and didn’t trust him to include hardline Republicans in the party’s legislative process. But the factors that once made McCarthy’s leadership dreams untenable have largely washed away. He’s both close to leadership as the majority leader and a friend of Trump’s, who reportedly calls him “my Kevin,” an alliance even the most Trump-loving House conservatives have had a tough time ignoring. Democrats made significant gains in the 2018 midterms, winning 34 GOP-held seats for a net gain of 32 seats to win the House majority. When all is said and done, it’s possible Democrats could win up to 40 seats this year. But Democrats still fell short in the Senate — and Trump remains in the White House. House Republicans, with McCarthy at the helm, will have to make a choice: Do they work with the Democrats in the House, or resign themselves to playing politics until the 2020 election cycle? One factor may play a big role in McCarthy’s decision: The slimmed-down Republican conference is also significantly more conservative — and more Trumpy — than the current Congress. In the runup to the 2018 midterms, many of the most moderate Republicans in the House announced their retirement. On Election Day, Democrats were most successful in ousting the remaining ones, many of whom sat in suburban, anti-Trump districts. The most vulnerable Republicans in 2018 proved to be the “Republicans who sit in blueish districts, who support Trump uneasily, criticize him occasionally, and draw at least some lines he can’t cross,” as Vox’s Ezra Klein put it. Those who remain are the most bullish on the president. In many ways, that’s a good fit for McCarthy, who has worked to ingratiate himself with conservatives in the House and has always been more of a strong political messenger than a policy mastermind. But it does mean that securing actual tangible policy wins for Trump in the runup to the 2020 election will mean combating an increasingly polarized House.",https://www.vox.com/2018/11/14/18091966/kevin-mccarthy-minority-leader-house-jim-jordan,,Vox

Sources familiar with Disney, which was mulling a possible Twitter purchase last week, say the media giant has decided not to move forward. Earlier today Recode reported that Google, a logical buyer for Twitter who had also hired a banker to kick the company’s tires, was not going to bid; Apple is also unlikely. Twitter shares dropped 9 percent in after-hours trading. For now, that leaves Salesforce as the only potential buyer for Twitter, though the company has never confirmed publicly that it wants to make a deal. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff appeared on CNBC today and refused to comment directly on any interest in Twitter. Industry observers have thought that Disney and Twitter might make sense as a pairing. One reason is because Disney CEO Bob Iger is friendly with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who sits on Disney’s board. Another is that Disney is interested in finding new digital distribution outlets for its content, as its strength in TV begins to waver.

653,653,11-12-17 19:00,2017,12,11,Munchies Staff,Our Best Weed Stories of 2017,"Despite the looming threat of a war on weed from the US attorney general, 2017 continued to build on the momentum gained by the marijuana industry in 2016. West Virginia joined the ranks with legalized medical marijuana, and Colorado’s weed sales reached $1 billion in just eight months. It’s all starting to feel a bit like a watershed moment for the industry.  Weed turned the corner into the mainstream this year, becoming—dare we say it—basic. Here are some of our favorite stories from 2017 tracking weed’s transition from ""cool kid who gives no fucks"" to ""yoga mom who just wants to unwind."" Like so many artisanal food hawkers before her, Mina Carrillo left a high-powered, lucrative career in medical software engineering to launch a boutique food business, only with cannabis. After seeing the improvements to her daughter’s encephalopathy symptoms after a weed-infused meal, Carrillo became a convert. She created her Baron’s Confections line of products with medical uses in mind, but the macarons, eclairs and truffles look plenty tasty in their own right. Next up in Things We Didn’t Think Needed to Be Infused, a San Francisco Bay-area company introduced Entourage, a marijuana terpene-infused seltzer water. While not designed to actually get you high, the terpenes in the water act like an aromatherapy candle, and can affect the way your brain processes mood, appetite, and pain sensation. Following in the little-to-no buzz terpenes-based edible fashion, there was this doughnut that raised the question: is an edible still an edible if it doesn’t get you stoned?  Lest you believe that 2017 was the year the unicorn frappe unseated the PSL as the most insidious Starbucks beverage, GOOD CO-OP was there to reassure you that the cinnamon-and-nutmeg hysteria was indeed still going strong. Their line of weed-infused pumpkin spice blondies reminded us that nothing is sacred in 2017. Like Mina Carillo, Yannick Crespo abandoned a lush salary to create a weed-infused artisanal food product that, as our writer said, “checks a lot of boxes for the millennial food aficionado.” Pot d’Huile is a scientifically formulated olive oil containing THC, designed for the foodie type who’s also looking for a little buzz.  But as much as the weed landscape appears to have changed in 2017, some things stayed the same. We were here for you with our best recipes for quintessential stoner foods, from nachos, to ramen, to brownies.  And then there was Alex Trebek, confessing in an interview that he’s made some rookie edibles mistakes just like the rest of us. While at a party in the ‘70s, Trebek unwittingly wolfed down half a dozen “hash brownies,” and ended up tripping so hard he couldn’t leave his friend’s house for two days.  Finally, we leave you with our interview with the “global ambassador of ganja himself,” Mr. Snoop D-O-double-G. We kicked back with some gin and juice—recipe borrowed from his pal Martha Stewart—and talked rap, stoner snacks, and his philosophy of being respectful with your blunts. Even Snoop toned it down in 2017. At the end of this hell storm of a year, we, too, just want to be laid back (with our minds on our money and our money on our minds).

655,655,07-09-18 00:00,2018,9,7,Sarah N. Lynch,Ex-Trump campaign aide Papadopoulos sentenced to 14 days in prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - George Papadopoulos, a former aide to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, was sentenced on Friday to 14 days in prison after pleading guilty last year to lying to federal agents investigating whether campaign members coordinated with Russia before the election.  Prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Papadopoulos lied to agents about his contacts with Russians during the campaign “to minimize both his own role as a witness and the extent of the campaign’s knowledge of his contacts,” according to the government’s sentencing memorandum.  Among those contacts were London-based professor Joseph Mifsud, who told him the Russians had “dirt” on Trump’s Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”  Papadopoulos defended himself and contradicted White House officials in a CNN special program Saturday night, “The Mysterious case of George Papadopoulos.”  In the interview with CNN reporter Jake Tapper, Papadopoulos said that he raised the prospect of Trump and his campaign officials meeting with the Russians.  “The candidate (Trump) gave a nod, but did not commit either way,” he said.  Trump has denied knowing anything about contact with Russians and his campaign.  Russia has denied U.S. allegations that it interfered in the campaign and Trump denies campaign collusion.  Prosecutors had asked Judge Randolph Moss in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to impose a prison sentence of up to six months, saying that Papadopoulos’ lies impeded their investigation and that he did not cooperate.  “He didn’t come close to the standard of ‘substantial assistance,’” prosecutor Andrew Goldstein told the judge at the sentencing hearing. “It was at best, begrudging efforts to cooperate.”  In addition to the prison time, Papadopoulos was sentenced to one year of supervised release and 200 hours of community service. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $9,500.   Friday was his first public court appearance since he pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI while the case was still sealed.  “I hope to have a second chance to redeem myself,” Papadopoulos told the judge.   “I made a dreadful mistake but I am a good man.”  He and his wife left the courthouse without speaking to the press. However, Papadopoulos’ mother Kiki told reporters she was satisfied he had received a fair sentence.  “I am very happy with the judge. He was very fair,” Kiki Papadopoulos said. “I would have preferred less time in jail, but that’s OK. It will give him time to think things over.”  The White House distanced itself from Papadopoulos, referring to his campaign role as nothing more than a low-level coffee boy, after his guilty plea.  His mother said on Friday that she “still supports” Trump.  The sentence that Papadopoulos received is about half the prison time given to Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who was also charged with lying to the FBI during the special counsel’s probe. Van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison.  Moss said he wanted to impose some prison time because while he did not “remotely believe Mr Papadopoulos was seeking to assist the Russian government,” he was nevertheless troubled by Papadopoulos’ selfish motives to lie to the FBI so that he would not lose a shot at getting a possible job in the Trump administration.  Ultimately, Moss said he felt Papadopoulos expressed genuine remorse. The judge who sentenced Van der Zwaan, by contrast, did not feel he was contrite about his crimes.  During Friday’s hearing, Papadopoulos’ attorney Thomas Breen went out his way to praise the FBI, and he also criticized Trump for calling the Russia probe fake news and a witch hunt.  “The president of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could,” Breen told the judge.  He portrayed Papadopoulos as a naive young man who was “being worked by a pro,” a reference to Professor Mifsud, whom he later said he believes was working for Russia and trying to take advantage of his client.  “No offense, but he was unsophisticated, he was naive and he was foolish,” Breen said in court.  Breen told reporters after Friday’s hearing that Papadopoulos does not recall telling anyone in the Trump campaign about Mifsud’s comments about the Russians having dirt on Clinton.  The lies Papadopoulos told in his voluntary interview with the FBI on Jan. 27, 2017, prosecutors said, “undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.”  In addition, they said Papadopoulos did not provide “substantial assistance” and only came clean after he was confronted with his own emails, texts and other evidence.  In December 2017, two months after his guilty plea, the FBI had plans for a follow-up meeting with Papadopoulos.   The FBI canceled the meeting when it discovered that Papadopoulos had sat down for a media interview about the case. He and his wife later participated in more media interviews.  Papadopoulos was pictured in March 2016 sitting at a table with Trump, then-campaign adviser Jeff Sessions who went on to become U.S. attorney general, and other foreign policy campaign advisers.  At that meeting, Papadopoulos proposed brokering a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Sessions has previously testified to Congress that he pushed back against the proposal, but the memo filed by Papadopoulos’s lawyers contradicts Sessions’ account, saying that both Trump and Sessions appeared receptive to the idea.  But Papadopoulos, referring to Sessions, said to CNN, “I remember that he was enthusiastic about a potential meeting.”  CNN’s Tapper noted that Session’s attorneys said that Sessions stands by his testimony, and denied encouraging a meeting with Russians.  The court filing confirms reporting by Reuters in March about the difference between Sessions’ testimony and how others recounted his reaction to the proposal at the meeting.  Papadopoulos told CNN that he hopes to return to politics in the future.  “I made mistakes and I will pay for my mistakes,” he said, adding, “I don’t want to give up my goal of staying in politics.”     Reporting by Sarah N.

656,656,08-06-17 16:40,2017,6,8,"Lia Kantrowitz, Rachel M. Cohen",Crooked Chicago Cops May Get Off the Hook Thanks to Trump,"Ja'Mal Green has had an exhausting year. Last July, after a protest he helped organize in response to the police shootings that killed Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, Green was arrested for allegedly attacking Chicago police, put in jail with a $350,000 bail, and ultimately indicted on nine felony charges. Green and his friends and family denied the allegations, but after nine months of back-and-forth, he decided to take the prosecutors' deal: plead guilty to one misdemeanor count of resisting police in exchange for dropping all felony charges.  Green, a 21-year-old activist in Chicago, says he wanted to alleviate his stress and move on with his life—but insists that even the misdemeanor charge was bogus.  ""As a black male coming up in Chicago, I mean we all had that experience of being racially profiled, and officers treating us like we're suspects and criminal,"" Green told VICE. ""Even at protests, you go through so much crap, they yell out slurs, hit you for no reason. Getting arrested and charged showed me first-hand how corrupt the police [are]."" Green's experience roughly coincided with a sweeping investigation of Chicago cops by the Justice Department under Barack Obama, which found evidence of routine civil rights violations and excessive use of force. After the scathing federal report came out in January, Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, signed an ""agreement in principle"" to negotiate a consent decree, or a legal settlement between a city and the feds overseen by a federal judge. This wasn't unusual: The Obama administration routinely opened investigations into police departments, looking closely at 25 of them between 2009 and 2016, and entering into consent decrees with 14. But President Donald Trump's attorney general Jeff Sessions has expressed deep skepticism about consent decrees, once calling them ""undemocratic"" and ""dangerous."" In February, Sessions went so far as to dismiss his own department's 161-page report on Chicago cops, suggesting he hadn't read it, but that it seemed ""pretty anecdotal."" Now the question is whether Chicago will essentially use Donald Trump's presidency to avoid changing the way local cops do their jobs, and more broadly, whether other big-city mayors with relatively progressive political profiles might hide behind a pro-cop White House to avoid aggressively responding to legacies of police abuse. Check out our chat with Chicago gang members about violence and police in the city. Even as some cities like Baltimore commit to using consent decrees to overhaul police practices, Mayor Emanuel no longer feels a federal judge is necessary to ensure police reform actually happens in his city. Instead, the mayor wants Chicago to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the feds, a tool cities like Washington, DC, and Cincinnati pursued to deal with their police problems. There are ""many roads to reform, but they all hit the same destination,"" as Emanuel put it this week in a press conference.  Prominent civil rights leaders and experts who worked on police reform under Barack Obama were quick to blast the mayor's retreat. ""There are significant factual differences between what happened in Cincinnati and DC compared to Chicago, and you didn't have the same kind of corruption and cover-up,"" said Jonathan Smith, the executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the former chief of special litigation in the DOJ's civil rights division who oversaw the federal probe of police in Ferguson, Missouri. The cover-up Smith is referring to is the case of Laquan McDonald, the 17-year-old who was (fatally) shot 16 times on a Chicago street in 2014. Dash-cam video of that incident was buried by city officials until late 2015, when a court order helped force it into the open.  ""History has demonstrated that [MOAs], which are not court-enforceable, are not robust enough to remedy longstanding problems,"" added Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and former head of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department under Obama. ""Given the size of the Chicago Police Department and the severity of the accountability and use of force problems that were thoroughly documented in the findings report, a [MOA] in this matter will become yet another set of recommendations for the Chicago Police Department that will have no teeth. Chicago has seen this pattern over and over again."" The Department of Justice did not return a request for comment, but Adam Collins, Mayor Emanuel's communicators director, defended the move in part by suggesting the new regime in DC forced their hand. ""Obviously there's a new administration and their opinions of consent decrees are very well documented,"" he told me. ""For months the city and city attorneys have been in discussion with DOJ about a framework to guide future reforms, and the draft MOA that we submitted last week is a product of those discussions."" Collins emphasized that over the last 18 months, Chicago has implemented a number of police reforms, including body cameras and new training oversight. And it's true that without a consent decree, Chicago has made some progress. Last month, the Chicago Police Department announced a package of new rules designed to restrict when officers use deadly force, and guide officers on how they should deescalate situations and aid wounded suspects. (Critics note that the changes were watered-down from reforms first proposed last fall.) William Calloway, another Chicago activist, thinks the new accountability measures were ""a really monumental win"" for reformers. While he was greatly disappointed to see his mayor back away from the consent decree, he wasn't exactly surprised. ""Once you've been a resident for a while and you've seen the dealings of Rahm Emanuel and the way he plays politics, nothing too much shocks you,"" Calloway said.  Green, for his part, expressed skepticism that even a consent decree would work in Chicago, emphasizing that real change has to come from inside the police force. ""But I think if the Justice Department is going to step in, then they should actually start bringing justice and lock up people in power,"" he added. Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore cop and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told me that while there's a legitimate argument that consent decrees can force a city's hand, especially if reforms are being held up by police union contracts or other barriers, he worries they're becoming somewhat of a fad. ""I don't know if Emanuel gives a damn about police misconduct,"" Moskos said. ""But if he does, he could do something. The department is under his control."" But citing police reform in Seattle and New Orleans, Smith, the former DOJ official, insisted consent decrees are effective tools, and especially necessary in the worst cases—Chicago among them. ""The bad news is that this new DOJ is retreating from its commitment to enforcing the constitution,"" says Smith. ""The good news is there's a lot of incredibly talented activists in Chicago who are not going to let this go. It may take a little longer, it may be a little harder to get there, but they're going to insist on change."" Follow Rachel M.

658,658,13-04-17 00:00,2017,4,13,Letitia Stein,"At home, rebel Republican lawmakers pay no price for defying Trump","PALATKA, Fla. (Reuters) - At a town hall in his conservative Florida district this week, U.S. Representative Ted Yoho drew applause for defying his own Republican Party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was President Donald Trump’s first major legislative initiative.  Far from paying a price back home, as Trump has threatened they would, Yoho and some of the other far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two-week congressional recess.  A handful of House Freedom Caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month’s defeat of Trump’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also rejected by some Republican moderates.  Many supporters made clear they expect them to work with Trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation’s health care system.  “I want it done,” said Bob White, 74, after questioning Yoho on the issue during a town hall on Tuesday night in rural Putnam County, Florida. “Wield that big stick.”   The rebellious faction of conservatives in the House of Representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by Trump to rewrite Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Trump has singled out the group for blame.  Many caucus members refused to back the Republican leadership’s bill because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. At town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs.  The reception for Yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the Republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of Congress, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at Catholic University of America, who studies congressional parties and leaders.  “The Freedom Caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents ‘good job,’” he said. “Or if they don’t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.”  Michigan Representative Justin Amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a White House adviser called on Twitter for Trump supporters to defeat him in a primary.  But in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker Kellogg Co, the four-term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan on Tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending.  “If I had to choose between Justin and Trump, I’d go with Justin for sure,” said construction worker Eric Smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found Trump lacking conservative principles. “At this point, I’d give Donald Trump a D.”   Retiree Cliff Ward, 72, told Amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions.  “Now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done,” he added.      Living in Georgetown, Florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, Trump voter Melvin Shebester knew little about the House Freedom Caucus.  The faction of small-government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream Republican leadership in the House, including an attempt to push out former Republican House Speaker John Boehner.  The 84-year-old Shebester was impressed that his congressman, Yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed.  “It takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,” said Shebester, attending Yoho’s town hall on Tuesday night at a government center in Palatka, Florida with his son and grandson.  “We can’t go up there and tell Trump he’s wrong,” added his son, Steven Shebester, 56, who lives nearby.       Many Republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.   But Yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. His event in Gainesville, a college town, on Monday was crowded by left-leaning activists who at times shouted him down.  On Tuesday night in Palatka, a small town in Yoho’s sprawling district in north central Florida lined with oaks and Spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd.  He told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. And a phone survey of constituents found the Republican plan was as unpopular as Obamacare itself.  He said constituents gave him a clear message: “Stay the course.”  (This version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph)  Additional reporting by Steve Friess in Michigan and Lisa Maria Garza in Texas; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-freedomcaucus/at-home-rebel-republican-lawmakers-pay-no-price-for-defying-trump-idUSKBN17F2JZ,Politics,Reuters
659,659,25-12-17 00:00,2017,12,25,,Iran confirms upholding death sentence for academic over spying,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s Supreme Court has upheld a death sentence against a Sweden-based Iranian academic convicted of spying for Israel, the Tehran prosecutor was quoted as saying on Monday, confirming reports by Amnesty International and his family.  Ahmadreza Djalali, a medical doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute, a Stockholm medical university, was accused of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.  Djalali was arrested in Iran in April 2016 and later convicted of espionage. He has denied the charges, Amnesty said.   At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said were assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy. Western powers and Israel said Iran aimed to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran denied this.  The Islamic Republic hanged a man in 2012 over the killings, saying he was an agent for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.  On Monday, Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said the Supreme Court recently upheld the death sentence against Djalali, the news site of Iran’s judiciary, Mizan, reported.  Dolatabadi said Djalali had confessed to meeting Mossad agents repeatedly to deliver information on Iran’s nuclear and defense plans and personnel, and helping to infect Defense Ministry  computer systems with viruses, Mizan reported.  London-based Amnesty International and Djalali’s wife said earlier this month that his lawyers were told that the Supreme Court had considered his case and upheld his death sentence.  Iranian state television broadcast last week what it described as Djalali’s confessions. His wife said he had been forced by his interrogators to read the confession.  Djalali was on a business trip to Iran when he was arrested and sent to Evin prison. He was held in solitary confinement for three months of his detention and tortured, Amnesty said.   It said Djalali wrote a letter inside prison in August stating he was being held for refusing to spy for Iran.  Sweden condemned the sentence in October and said it had raised the matter with Iranian envoys.  Seventy-five Nobel prize laureates petitioned Iranian authorities last month to release Djalali so he could “continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind”.

Ten days ago, more than a dozen workers in California got sick from it.  Chlorpyrifos, made by Dow Chemical, has been banned for residential use for about 15 years but is used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different kinds of crops including citrus fruits, apples, almonds, corn, and soybeans. The EPA under the Obama administration had recommended that chlorpyrifos be banned, but current EPA chief (and longtime EPA critic) Scott Pruitt, decided to let farms keep using it in one of his first formal actions.  More than dozen workers on a cabbage farm south of Bakersfield, California, got sick on May 5th: 12 people reported nausea and vomiting, one person fainted, and one worker was taken to the hospital. The farm supervisor told a local news station that a nearby citrus orchard was sprayed with a pesticide called Vulcan the night before; chlorpyrifos is the active ingredient in Vulcan. The Kern County Department of Agriculture and Measurement Standards is testing the chemicals involved to determine if chlorpyrifos was indeed present, but results aren't in yet. At least 50 workers were exposed but half of them left before medical personnel arrived.  Mother Jones notes that Dow Chemical has multiple links to the Trump administration: The company donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee in December 2016 and Trump named its CEO Andrew Liveris to lead the American Manufacturing Council.

662,662,12-06-19 00:00,2019,6,12,"Rajendra Jadhav, Promit Mukherjee",India evacuates hundreds of thousands as cyclone Vayu builds fury,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India evacuated hundreds of thousands of people to shelters along the coast in its western state of Gujarat as a cyclone gathering intensity over the Arabian Sea was expected to hit land on Thursday.  Weather officials said Cyclone Vayu, with wind speeds equivalent to those of a Category 1 hurricane, is set to cross the coast with sustained wind speeds of 145 kph to 155 kph (90 mph to 96 mph), and could gust as high as 170 kph (106 mph).  The state government said it had begun moving about 300,000 people from the most vulnerable areas into shelters.   “We have started evacuation in coastal districts today morning,” a Gujarat disaster management official said on Wednesday.               The state’s chief minister, Vijay Rupani, has asked India’s military and its National Disaster Response Force for help with rescue and relief efforts if the cyclone causes widespread damage and disruption.  The federal home minister, Amit Shah, also urged officials to ensure swift restoration of utilities such as power, telecoms and drinking water if they are disrupted by the cyclone.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned the cyclone could hold up the progress of annual monsoon rains, as the storm drew rain clouds from over the sea.  The monsoon was already about a week late in arriving at Kerala on the southern coast this year, and much of the country has broiled in a summer heatwave in recent weeks.  Gujarat is also home to large refineries and sea ports near the storm’s path.   India’s biggest oil refinery, owned by Reliance Industries, is in Gujarat, though a company official said the cyclone was expected to weaken by the time it reached the Jamnagar-based refinery.  “But in case the course changes or intensifies, the refinery is ready for any contingency,” he added, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.  Sikka Ports and Terminals Ltd, which handles crude oil and refined products for Reliance Industries Ltd, halted vessel berthing at a western port on Wednesday over a cyclone warning, according to a port notice.  The company’s ports also handle oil and refined products cargo for Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd, a subsidiary of state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd.  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd is  preparing to move employees at two ports it runs to safer areas, a spokesman said.  “Our Mundra and Tuna ports will be closest to the path,” he added. “All the necessary precautions are being put in place.”   Nayara Energy, owned by a consortium led by Russia’s Rosneft, said it was monitoring the situation and also taking precautionary measures at its Gujarat refinery.  In May, Cyclone Fani, the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, killed at least 34 people on India’s eastern coast, destroying houses and ripping off roofs.  Authorities had evacuated more than 1.2 million people in advance of the storm, after an even more powerful cyclone in 1999 killed about 10,000 people and caused damage running into billions of dollars.

664,664,11-06-19 00:00,2019,6,11,George Obulutsa,Power from Kenya's planned Lamu plant could cost 10 times more than estimated: study,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Electricity from a coal-fired power plant due to be built in Kenya by a Kenyan-Chinese consortium will cost consumers up to 10 times more than planned, a U.S. thinktank says, raising further doubts about the long-delayed project.  Construction of the plant on the Kenyan mainland opposite the tourist island of Lamu was scheduled to begin in 2015 but has been repeatedly halted, due in part to opposition by environmentalists.   Amu Power, a consortium comprising Kenya’s Gulf Energy and Centum Investment and a group of Chinese companies, is due to build the plant after winning the government contract.  The plant’s backers say it would help tackle Kenya’s frequent blackouts by increasing generation capacity by nearly a third and generating power that would cost about half what consumers currently pay.    But opponents say those costs are much higher than projected.   Amu Power says electricity from the plant will cost 7.2 U.S. cents per KWh. But that is “highly optimistic,” the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in an independent study, which is the most extensive so far on the plant’s cost.  It said the 1000-MW coal-fired plant’s 25-year power purchasing agreement would cost consumers more than $9 billion, even if it does not generate any power.   “The true costs of Lamu’s electricity during the years 2024 through 2037 could average as high as US 22 to US 75 cents per KWh — three to 10 times the company’s 2014 projection,” the study noted. “We believe Kenya should cancel the project.”   The study said the plant’s backers had underpriced coal imports and rising operational and maintenance costs.  Joseph Njoroge, principal secretary at the Ministry of Energy, said the plant was competitive but did not address specific concerns.  “One condition of any competitively acquired project is to sustain the bid specifications to the end,” he said in a text message to Reuters. “The plant will be put up with (the) aim of producing electricity based on sound economic projections.”  Francis Njogu, chief executive officer of Amu Power, did not respond to requests for comment.  Kenya’s Energy Regulatory Commission, which sets tariffs, also did not respond to a request for comment.   The plant’s location on the mainland in the coastal Lamu County region is about 14 km from Lamu island, a famous ancient Swahili settlement and UNESCO World heritage site and a top tourist destination.  Environmentalists say the plant will pollute the air, destroying mangroves and breeding grounds for five endangered species of marine turtles, fish and other marine life.  In 2018, a Kenyan court suspended the project for a second time, sending the dispute back to an environmental tribunal. It is expected to issue a decision later this month on whether the project can go ahead.

665,665,11-03-17 00:00,2017,3,11,Natalie Haddad,Remembering Martin Kippenberger’s Self-Performance,"His drunken antics and grand gestures amounted to a life that New York Times art critic Roberta Smith once called “an extended, alcohol-fueled performance piece.” Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads On March 7, 1997, German artist Martin Kippenberger died of liver cancer at the age of 43. His death marked the end of an extraordinary and prolific career that included painting, installations, music, books and ephemera, and even a brief foray into acting. But at the heart of it was Kippenberger himself. His drunken antics and grand gestures — mooning and heckling crowds; naming a gas station in Brazil after a Nazi official; opening a museum and a fake subway station on a Greek island — amounted to a life that New York Times art critic Roberta Smith once called “an extended, alcohol-fueled performance piece.” At the same time, he centered attention on himself with several artworks that featured his image — or that of the character “Kippenberger” — including exhibition posters, paintings, and postcards. What is often lost in posthumous accounts of Kippenberger’s life and persona is the intelligence and multilayered critique in his work: of himself; identity politics; and the ideological constructs of late capitalist subjectivity. In her 2001 performance piece “Art Must Hang,” artist Andrea Fraser both commemorated and critiqued the “performance piece” that was Martin Kippenberger, reenacting word-for-word a drunken speech Kippenberger gave in 1995. Fraser’s performance is predicated on the slippage between art and life— or lives — of both artists. That slippage is also a reminder of how deftly Kippenberger played Kippenberger Art critic Diedrich Diederichsen has described the artist as a “Selbstdarsteller,” literally, a self-performer. Kippenberger emerged at a moment in the mid-1970s when the concepts of subjectivity and identity in art were undergoing critical interrogation. For Kippenberger, however, the ideological construct of the “self” was less a point of interrogation than a point of departure. Throughout the 1970s, he produced several self-promotional posters, as well as a series of tourist-style photographs, in which he “performed” his own identity, constructing “Kippenberger” as, to use a phrase from Roland Barthes, an “artificial myth.” In his essay “Myth Today” (1957), Barthes proposes that, “the best weapon against myth is perhaps to mythify it in its turn, and to produce an artificial myth.” In works such as the series of “tourist” postcards; a sheet of stamps, “Twenty-One Years Among You, Kippenberger 1953-1974” (1974); and a poster, “A Quarter Century of Kippenberger as One of You, Among You, With You” (1978), Kippenberger performs an identity founded in myth (i.e., the myth of the artist, or the myth of the transcendent subject). For the postcard series, Kippenberger poses as the consummate tourist in tourist havens around the United States. The postcards show him mugging for the camera with a Disney actor in a Goofy costume; donning a cowboy outfit; mimicking his “escape” from a prison cell through its bent bars; and poised on a hill top with a suitcase. The series demonstrates the fluidity of Kippenberger’s self-performance. The images parody the trope of the tourist by theatricalizing the artist’s absorption into the role, while simultaneously performing the role of Martin Kippenberger. By posing as a “servant of tourism,” in Kippenberger’s words (Knechte des Tourismus in German), he positions himself as a trope, “the tourist.” Kippenberger’s self-performance conflates the persona with the person. This doubling, of himself as himself, is multiplied by the reproductive capacity of his media. The myth of a transcendent (white male) artist is undone by his deliberate and hyperbolic visibility as a performer; by replicating his representation, he not only objectifies himself, but also objectifies the transcendent subject as another replicable sign to be passively consumed in the system of commodity exchange. “Twenty-One Years Among You, Kippenberger 1953-1974” and “A Quarter Century of Kippenberger as One of You, Among You, With You,” which promote his 21st and 25th birthdays, respectively, further conflate the performed persona and the actual person. The image on the poster for “A Quarter Century” pairs Kippenberger with an elderly man in a restaurant. While the artist sits, his companion stands, wrapping one arm around Kippenberger’s shoulder and shaking his hand with the other arm. The German text, “1/4 Jhdt. Kippenberger als einer von Euch, unter Euch, mit Euch,” is printed on the bottom corner, and descriptive adjectives encircle Kippenberger’s smiling face. “Twenty-One Years Among You,” by contrast, is a set of forty-eight stamps printed in pink and white, all but one, a blank, bearing a portrait photo of Kippenberger at a different age. In all these works, Kippenberger the artist replicates Kippenberger the subject in a process that loosely parallels Andy Warhol’s self-portraits. The artwork has no essential, shrouded meaning; all that it means is inscribed on the surface. Yet where Warhol attempted to empty the sign of meaning, producing pure surface, Kippenberger attempts the opposite. He exaggerates his visibility, but presents it as an overdetermined subjectivity, again, what Barthes identifies as “mythifying” the myth. Kippenberger thus forms his narrative through what Craig Owens identifies as the rhetoric of the pose, or the “Medusa Effect.” Owens writes, “[T]o strike a pose is to present oneself to the gaze of the other as if one were already frozen, immobilized – that is, already a picture.”  Kippenberger performs himself through the pose — in Owens’s words, as “already a picture.” The narrative performed in the images (the poster, the stamps) reproduces Kippenberger as “Kippenberger.” The system of subjectivity perpetually defers subjectivity itself. In “Twenty-One Years Among You,” Kippenberger is identified as “among you,” while in “A Quarter Century,” he is “one of you, among you, with you.” In both works, the title harnesses the image to two identities, “Kippenberger” and an unspecified “you,” which is dispersed among all that is not Kippenberger: the old man in “Quarter Century”; the artist’s peers; and his viewers. In this way, the “you” is addressed to an anonymous, unfixed, and replicable body. The relationship between Kippenberger and the audience (“you”) thus forms an invisible ideological network premised on a utopian — and inevitably impossible — system of collectivity and inclusiveness. Yet as the artist plays the one as the many, the egalitarianism of the title is betrayed by the repetition of Kippenberger’s image: the “one” is Kippenberger, but the many, paradoxically, is an absence to be filled in by the one’s presence. The result is that Kippenberger is not made one of the people; the people are made into “Kippenberger.” Kippenberger is therefore constructed in rhetoric, but the construction is his own, and the rhetoric is deliberately deployed — marked as fake, as parody. Kippenberger’s German heritage is an ineluctable presence in works like “A Quarter Century” — the proclamation “one of you, among you” can be perceived as a parody of Nazi propaganda (“Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer”), but it can also be read as an adoption of its strategies, a charge his critics leveled against him. (And that continued to dog him, encouraged by such projects as his 1986 “Martin Bormann Gas Station,” named after the Nazi official.) Kippenberger responded sardonically, with the 1984 abstract painting “Ich kann beim besten Willen kein Hakenkreuz erkennen” (“To the Best of My Ability, I Can See No Swastika”). The irony of identifying Kippenberger with nationalism or Nazi propaganda is that, as his works undermine the myth of the artist as a sovereign subject, they also illuminate the performative nature of identity. At their best, his works project the instability of the “self” onto the viewer by asserting the subject “Kippenberger,” but failing to finalize what Kippenberger stands for, who he is. Twenty years after his death, Kippenberger’s art continues his self-performance, questioning preconceptions of the artist and opening into new selves.",https://hyperallergic.com/363632/remembering-martin-kippenbergers-self-performance/,,Hyperallergic
666,666,19-06-18 15:30,2018,6,19,Katherine Keating,An Introduction to VICE Impact's Partnership With evian,"VICE’s reporting has taken our audience from offshore oil rigs to anti-fracking rallies to flood lands left behind after Hurricane Harvey. We tell these stories because we believe that information empowers people and that we can all contribute to enacting change. To that end, we have built partnerships with foundations, nonprofits, advocacy groups and brands seeking to drive social progress on issues important to us all. In this context, we’re announcing a new partnership with evian to address plastic waste and the role of businesses in environmental protection. Bottled water and products made of plastic are widely regarded as agents of carbon emissions and ocean pollution. But what role should the private sector play in solving this global problem? We need to recognize when companies are taking the necessary steps to curb their emissions and reduce their plastic waste.  The world-leading French bottled water company might seem at odds with an initiative to encourage climate action, but evian is willing to prove otherwise. They have recently announced a series of bold commitments: an aim to offset pollution caused by transporting evian water by 2020, and a pledge for full circularity by 2025, meaning that all their bottles will be made from 100% recycled plastic. Here is a company recognizing its responsibility in a global problem, assuming a leadership role in solving it, and working to offset its contributions. That is why we chose to partner with evian, to tell the story of their shift to a circular business model. How will they do it? In short: with a lot of money and a lot of effort. evian will offset their carbon emissions by funding research into ocean clean up programs and new systems that produce energy from natural biogasses. They will be fully transparent about their efforts, and in the process, hope to set a new industry standard to hold other water brands accountable. And finally, they will work hard to influence consumer behavior through initiatives that encourage reuse and recycling. Like VICE Impact, they want to empower people to make their own change. VICE Impact will document evian’s innovative efforts through films and editorial. We will not shy away from asking them challenging questions: What is circularity and can it really improve their operations and carbon output? What material difference can a bottled water company make when it comes to fighting marine waste? And how can each of us get involved in curbing our environmental footprint? Plans like these, coming from a global company like evian, have the power to make a significant contribution to curbing carbon emissions and plastic waste, a mission that has never been more urgent. As it stands today, global plastic production is set to double in the next 20 years and quadruple to 318 million tonnes by 2050, at which point the ocean will contain more plastic than fish by weight. Wary of the pace at which this is happening, we are confident in our decision to track evian’s commitments and journey along the way, and see how they plan to make circularity a reality.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwmpnz/an-introduction-to-vice-impacts-partnership-with-evian,Livable Planet,Vice

668,668,12-04-16 14:25,2016,4,12,David Garber,UK Dubstep Crew Chord Marauders Are Back With More of That 'Groove Booty',"While some dance fans in the post-EDM era lack complete understanding of dubstep, others have found ways to latch on to some of the core components of the genre—adding their own unique flair to the genre's austere, spaced-out sound. The UK crew and record label, Chord Marauders are an example of the sorts of visionaries pushing the genre into new territories. The beats they make don't sound like dubstep in the Burial sort of way—or early Skream—but more along the lines if the two spent a night in a jazz bar, smoked a blunt, and threw on some sort of velvet jumper.  The group's first vinyl-only release—and the fourth installment of their Groove Booty series—drops May 1, and is set to feature new tracks from label mainstays like Geode, Jafu, Congi, B9 (as well as affiliates like K-LONE and Circula), in addition to two-discs of succulent cuts from their back catalogue. Sticking to the vibe that many of their fans have come to know and love, the album flows vibrantly with a spread of jazzified, low-end bass melodies, often unfolding into lanes of grooving 2-step and abstract instrumentation that's hits your pleasure points in all the right places. Along with a stream of one of the comp's hottest tunes—Australia-based B9's head-down gem ""Bip Bap Bop""—we caught up with labelhead Geode for a chat about the label's current milestone, getting to finally connect IRL with some of their long time contributing producers, as well as where the world's current dubstep scene is going. THUMP: What have been some of the biggest moments for the Chord Marauders crew since the last album release? Geode: Finally linking up with James (Jafu) and Travis (B9) were both big moments. I met James at Shambhala Festival, set in the pristine wilderness of BC, Canada, where we were both booked to play. Not only getting to meet James, but to hear an hour of his music on a Funktion-One sound system was a real privilege, and definitely felt like a validation of everything we are doing with Chord Marauders. I met Travis in London when he was traveling through Europe with some of his crew. We only spent a day together but it was great to just hang and make some music in the real world. Describe the vibe of the new release a bit, and how it marks an evolution from the last LP.There have been some subtle changes, like featuring Circula for the first time. His track, ""For Esbjorn"" is a bit of departure from our usual - slowed down at 130BPM, with these dusty piano loops. The track falls on Side B, alongside tracks by Ago & B9, which overall has a more earthy feel to our usual stuff. This is contrasted against Side A, which provides the pushier, synthier vibe for which we're better known- and Sides C&D, comprised of 6 favorites from the back catalogue that we wanted to commemorate on vinyl. What's your take on the dubstep scene currently in the UK? Anyone you'd like to shout out?The traditional dubstep sound, and the scene that surrounded it, has undoubtedly become a lot smaller in the UK. In many ways, that needed to happen because that mono-tonal, faux-aggressive, big snare sound was getting quite tired. Despite all this, a handful of producers & labels like Innamind, Deep Medi, Artikal, and Deep Heads have been able to maintain prominence, thanks, in a big way, to promoters in North America, Canada and Europe. And, whereas many of those successful innovators have combined dubstep with grime, techno and half time jungle influences, we've steered in a more vibe-oriented direction - standing on the shoulders of giants such as Silkie, Martyn and 2562. This side of 140 is simmering nicely, with a whole a raft of producers such as Mercy, Ago & K-LONE all coming into their prime, and many more on the rise. What's also exciting is seeing that minor-7th aesthetic growing in popularity amongst more established producers, across the genre spectrum, evident in tracks such as Sorrow - ""Iscariot"", Ivy Lab - ""Gomeisa"" and Flava D - ""Tell Me"". Vibe and groove oriented music is undoubtedly growing, and I like to think we're a small part of that. Any plans to take the label to America?Maybe next year if circumstances permit.

669,669,19-09-16 15:37,2016,9,19,Andrew Prokop,Do terrorist attacks make a Trump win more likely? Here’s what the research suggests.,"For some time, political observers have wondered — or feared — whether a major terror attack on American soil could sweep Donald Trump into the White House. The topic came up after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando back in June. And in the wake of a new series of bombings and attempted bombings in New York City and New Jersey, and a stabbing attack in Minnesota, the question of what effect terror could have on the presidential campaign once again seems urgent. Both candidates have wasted little time speaking out on the matter. Trump quickly blamed what he characterized as the Obama administration's weakness and immigration policies for the attacks, saying in a Fox News appearance Monday, ""We've been weak, our country's been weak, we're letting people in by the thousands, the tens of thousands. I've been saying we've gotta stop it."" And he added that in addition to the refugees President Obama has allowed into the country so far, ""Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he's let in."" Clinton, meanwhile, emphasized her foreign policy experience and tried to characterize Trump's extreme language as counterproductive in combating terrorism. ""I'm the only candidate in this race who's been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield,"" Clinton said in a press conference Monday. She added, ""The kinds of rhetoric and language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries."" Yet commentators have tended to disagree about how the aftermath of an attack is likely to play out. On the one hand, political scientist Norm Ornstein suggested to me that attacks could greatly improve Trump's poor prospects of winning, and Politico’s Blake Hounshell tweeted in March that ""America may be one major terrorist attack away from Donald Trump as president."" On the other, Trump is an erratic celebrity with no foreign policy experience, and the public could well instead turn to Hillary Clinton, as Jamelle Bouie, Greg Sargent, and Ross Douthat have argued. So earlier this year, I spoke with several top political scientists who have done research on this question, and reviewed their work to see what implications heightened fears of terror tend to have on voters. And according to Jennifer Merolla, a political scientist at UC Riverside who has long studied how terrorism impacts voters, her research suggests there's more reason to believe Trump would benefit than that Clinton would. ""On average, our findings suggest Trump may be advantaged,"" Merolla told me back in April. (Though she hastened to add that, due to the experience discrepancy, ""Hillary Clinton may not be as disadvantaged as other Democrats."") Trump’s biggest strengths on the terror issue are that he is a member of the more hawkish party, he uses more aggressive rhetoric, and he may be perceived as a ""stronger leader."" Plus, sadly enough, some research indicates that even his gender could be an advantage over Clinton when voters’ fear of terror is high. So in a vacuum, there are many reasons to expect Trump to benefit. ""Whenever terrorism is in the news, one way people cope with their anxiety and anger is to look for a leader to protect them — and, in a crisis context, to rescue them,"" Merolla said. Still, in many ways Trump of course isn’t a typical Republican candidate, and that he might not benefit to the same degree that ordinary Republicans might. In July, political scientists Bethany Albertson and Shana Kushner Gadarian made the case in Vox that Trump's lack of expertise and his generally unpopular policy proposals on terrorism would give the advantage on the issue to Clinton. Their experimental research found that voters are more likely to be convinced by politicians that offer solutions rather than politicians who mainly hype threats. (Of course, it is also possible that voters may become persuaded that Trump's proposed ban on Muslim immigration is a ""solution."") Trump is also far more likely to use intemperate and extreme rhetoric than the typical candidate, which could turn off voters. For instance, after the Orlando shootings, Trump conspiratorially implied that President Obama may sympathize with the attackers. ""The problem is that Trump is kinda this animal that doesn’t behave how people running for president usually behave,"" Michael Koch, a political scientist at Texas A&M University, told me in April. Of course, every terror incident has its own specific circumstances, and we can’t know whether any particular one will strike a chord with the public in any particular way. It's also hard to disentangle effects any one event might have on the polls — Clinton's lead over Trump did drop by a few points in the weeks after the Orlando shooting, but other topics were in the news too, like the FBI's announcement on its investigation into her emails and Bernie Sanders's then-refusal to endorse Clinton. ""It depends on the details, and on how these things are spun,"" Koch, speaking when the question was still hypothetical, said. ""But especially if you could spin it as a Democratic failure, or link it to failures of the Obama administration, it might advantage Trump."" And that’s just what Trump is trying to do. Perhaps the biggest reason to expect that Trump's support would rise after a terror attack is, simply, the party he belongs to. Polls consistently show that more Americans trust the Republican Party to effectively deal with terrorism than the Democrats. For instance, a Pew poll earlier last month gave Republicans a 9-point advantage on the question of which party would more effectively deal with ""the terrorist threat at home."" (Forty-six percent of respondents thought the GOP would do a better job, and just 37 percent thought Democrats would.) Furthermore, both experimental and real-world studies have tended to show that in the US and abroad, the major party with a more hawkish reputation usually benefits when international terror becomes a major concern. For instance, Koch, Laron Williams, and Jason Smith studied how quickly various parliamentary governments lost their majority coalitions after transnational terrorist attacks in a 2012 paper. What they found was that right-leaning governments had an easier time holding on to power than left-leaning governments did. It seems the left gets more blame for terrorist attacks that occur under its watch. Then there's evidence from Israel that indicates that terror helps the right at the ballot box. Claude Berrebi and Esteban Klor found that a terror attack in an Israeli locality shortly before the election causes, on average, ""an increase of 1.35 percentage points on that locality’s support for the right bloc of political parties."" And Anna Getmansky and Thomas Zeitzoff found that after rockets are fired into areas of Israel, even if there are no casualties, support for right-wing parties spikes in those areas by 2 to 6 percent. Finally, you might think the ""rally 'round the flag effect"" — the idea that public approval of the incumbent shoots up when terror becomes a major issue, as occurred for George W. Bush after 9/11 — could benefit Democrats, since they're the party that holds power right now. Yet Merolla and Elizabeth Zechmeister have found evidence suggesting that Democrats, as the more dovish party, wouldn't necessarily get that boost. In a 2013 paper, they looked at both survey data comparing times when terror fears are high with times when they aren't, and findings from a lab experiment ""priming"" only some subjects with the topic of terror. ""We find consistent evidence that evaluations of President Obama’s job performance at worst suffer, and at best are unaffected, when people are worried about terrorism,"" they concluded. Now, there are occasional examples that cut the other way. The Spanish elections of 2004, three days after the Madrid train bombings, seem to have hurt the right and swept a left-wing challenger party to power. These do appear to be the exception, though. Though Donald Trump has closed in on Hillary Clinton in polls lately, he remains extremely unpopular among the public — he's the most unpopular major party presidential nominee in decades of polling. Still, Trump's outspokenness and bluster do appear to have accomplished something important — they've convinced many voters that he's ""tough."" Two polls earlier this year, for instance — from CBS/New York Times, and ABC/the Washington Post — show Trump and Clinton essentially tied on the question of which would be a stronger leader. A third, from Fox News, found Trump heavily advantaged on the question compared with Clinton — 59 percent of respondents in that poll thought he was a ""strong leader,"" compared with just 38 percent who thought he wasn't. (Clinton's split was 49 to 50.) Merolla and her colleagues have found that when a terror threat looms, this question of ""leadership"" becomes paramount. In three experimental studies involving three different elections between 2004 and 2008, they found that when undergraduate subjects were primed to think about the threat of terrorism (by either viewing a short video or reading an article), they were more likely to say they'd vote for the candidate they viewed as a better ""leader."" ""Crisis situations evoke feelings of distress, anxiety, and hopelessness, which draw citizens to leaders who promise to deliver better times,"" Merolla and her co-authors have written. ""Charismatic leaders surface in times of crisis because they are seen as saviors and are perceived to have a unique ability to improve a critical situation."" Furthermore, in a 2004 study, psychologist Florette Cohen and several co-authors found that if subjects were spurred to think of their own mortality, they then said they'd be more likely to support a hypothetical politician with a charismatic leadership style — one who stresses the importance of bold risk-taking as well as ""vision"" and ""identity of the group."" Sound familiar? In Cohen’s study, this ""charismatic"" leader is contrasted with a hypothetical ""task-oriented leader"" whose strengths are about effectively achieving goals, and a ""relationship-oriented"" leader whose strengths are ""treating followers compassionately and respectfully"" — both of which have often been used to characterize Hillary Clinton’s style of leadership. When people are thinking about their own deaths, they apparently have little time for such niceties. When fears of terrorism and death come into people's minds, all sorts of primal feelings can come with them. And Merolla says gender stereotypes might be among them. ""We’ve done some work on what effect terrorism has on evaluations of female candidates,"" Merolla told me. ""And in some of that work, we’ve found that Democratic female candidates are particularly disadvantaged when terrorism is in the news. Because of party stereotypes and gender stereotypes, they're perceived as being weaker."" In a study conducted in 2005, Merolla and two co-authors again primed terror fears for certain groups of undergraduates. They asked whether their subjects believed that ""[m]en make better political leaders than women do,"" and found that those who viewed a brief presentation about terrorism were more likely to say they did. The researchers went on to ask respondents what they thought of various political figures — but the results didn't show a simple sexist swing. On the Republican side, both George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice were viewed more favorably when terrorism was primed. Yet on the Democratic side, views of John Kerry didn't change all that much — but views of Hillary Clinton became sharply worse. But the news isn't all bad for Clinton here. Keep in mind that this was before she served as secretary of state — so it's possible that it was mainly her relative lack of experience, not sexism, that explains the different effects for her and Kerry here. (Kerry had, after all, served in the military and had been his party's presidential nominee.) Indeed, Merolla told me that she and her colleagues conducted a similar follow-up study in 2012, after Clinton had gained foreign policy experience. ""We have not published this result yet, but we do not find the same negative effect on Clinton as we did in our earlier study,"" she says. (She did, however, find a negative effect on views of Nancy Pelosi.) Still, perceptions of Clinton didn't significantly improve, either — Clinton didn't get the same boost that Bush or Rice did in the earlier study. Now, there are limitations to studies like Merolla's — they take place in an artificial lab setting instead of the far more complex real world, and the usual subjects (undergraduates) aren’t representative of the electorate as a whole. Still, they are bolstered by that real-world evidence that terrorism often benefits the right politically, like the studies of Israel and parliamentary governments. Furthermore, if merely bringing up the possibility of terrorist attacks is enough to produce these effects in a lab among liberal-leaning undergraduates, the response to an actual attack in the country could well be even more pronounced. The bigger drawback is, unavoidably, that Trump’s uniqueness as a candidate gives us very little precedent for evaluating how his singular features — his erraticism, his penchant for conspiracy theories, and the fact that he's never held political office — could help or hurt him. Still, to be confident that Trump wouldn't be helped by a terror attack, you basically have to assume he's not an ordinary Republican candidate and that the electorate won't view him as such. Even though, since he’s clinched the nomination, the polls have gotten closer and the vast majority of GOP voters have fallen behind him. And keep in mind Michael Koch's comments that ""if you could spin it as a Democratic failure, or link it to failures of the Obama administration, it might advantage Trump."" That’s just what Trump is trying to do, painting President Obama’s failure to condemn ""radical Islam"" as emblematic of a deeper refusal to be ""tough"" enough to protect Americans. What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough Again, no one can say for sure how the politics of the New York attack, or any possible future attack, will play out. Perhaps the simplistic solution of an immigration crackdown that Trump is peddling will in fact prove popular. Or perhaps the public will be repelled by Trump's conspiratorial rumblings that Obama might be sympathetic to the terrorists. Still, the underlying research here suggests it certainly could have the potential to be a perilous moment for the Clinton campaign — if Trump’s own shortcomings don't hold him back.

Thomas, a five-time Pro Bowler who has been one of the best players in a frequently dominant unit, has a break in his left tibia, and probably will miss the rest of the season.

He's just 27 and such a move seems rash, but pro football is a rough game and more and more players are retiring earlier than expected, including Thomas's former teammate Marshawn Lynch, who happened to be on the Seattle sideline last night. So he very well could have meant what he said, and he could stick to it. He also wants his teammate to pick him up some dinner now, too: Gallows humor is the best humor.

671,671,02-08-16 12:40,2016,8,2,Alvin Chang,We can't fix policing without talking about race. This cartoon explains why.,"Black and white Americans experience law enforcement in fundamentally different ways. We know this because of data. Police hassle and question black people more frequently. Police use force against black people more frequently . And police are disproportionately likely to kill a black person than a white person. Some Americans are uncomfortable talking about police reform in the context of race, and have urged reform so that policing can be better for everyone. But the problem is that, throughout American history, law enforcement has always been unfair to an underclass of people — and today that divide is most pronounced along racial lines. And it’s caused this split in how black and white Americans feel about police: These feelings are important because, in order for police to do their job, a community has to comply with them. And they will only willingly comply if they approve of police actions. This is what is called ""legitimacy,"" and it's what gives modern police their authority in a democratic society. But as the data shows, police are more likely to treat blacks poorly and, in turn, blacks are more likely have a legitimacy problem with police. Meanwhile, white Americans tend to be treated much better, so in turn they give more legitimacy to police. So that's what this comic is about: The gap between how black and white Americans view police — how there has always been a group of Americans who believe the police to be a legitimate and rightful institution; how there has always been a group who have painful anecdotes to reject that notion; and how we can fix it. If police need legitimacy to do their jobs, then they need to figure out how to earn it. But what does it take to earn it? In 2008, Yale law professor Tracey Meares conducted an experiment to find out. She led a group of researchers who took about 1,400 people and showed them videos of police encounters. But before each video, they split participants into three groups and gave them different information to frame the police actions as either lawful, unlawful, or ambiguous. The participants weren't necessarily told if the situations were legal or not, but it was enough that most lawyers would agree whether or not it was constitutional. After researchers primed the participants with this information, they showed the three videos: Afterward, the participants were asked various questions, including whether or not they wanted to punish the police officers in the video. The goal was to figure out what people considered rightful policing. The researchers also asked about things that didn't have to do with legalities, like how fair, transparent, and respectful the officers were during the encounters — something called ""procedural justice."" In short, this is the part of policing that isn’t in the law books. Rather, it’s about how police officers interact with people. Then the researchers adjusted for a participant’s previous interaction with police, so it wouldn’t skew the results. It turns out that participants didn’t care that much about what is technically legal when deciding to punish an officer. Rather, they cared about procedural justice — or lack thereof. ""Even when the public says that they care about legality, and they do say that, our research suggests that the way they construct legality actually has nothing or very little to do with how lawyers think about that,"" said Meares, the Yale researcher who also recently served on President Obama's police task force. To model this point, she often includes this diagram in her work: In another study, Yale and Columbia University researchers surveyed about 1,300 men between the ages of 18 to 26 from diverse neighborhoods in New York. They asked them about their history with police, including how often they were stopped by cops. And then they asked them to rate how legitimate they perceived police to be. What they found was, after adjusting the responses for a respondent’s criminal history, people gave less legitimacy to police when they had been stopped by police more often. This hints that when police hassle people excessively, they lose legitimacy. In addition, their research backed up Meares’s study in finding that the most important factor for legitimacy was procedural justice — and that both black people and white people valued it greatly. Meanwhile, the thing that hurt legitimacy most was if a stop was intrusive, which is an example of low procedural justice. The policing Americans want isn’t necessarily the kind that is written in law. Rather, it’s about the way people are treated during the encounters — and we generally agree what this ""rightful"" policing looks like. But as shown at the top of this story, black people are far less likely to experience rightful policing. They are more likely to be stopped, pushed into a wall, and even killed. That’s why the president's police task force, as well as activist groups like Campaign Zero, have tried to frame police reform around ways to encourage procedural justice. While this doesn't give us an exact roadmap, it does show us what is broken about the everyday encounters between police and their communities — and how fixing that goes a long way toward building trust. If the job of police is to keep communities safe, then it only makes sense to judge their performance on crime data. And in the last 25 years, violent crime has been cut in half. There are many theories as to why, but a Brennan Center study found that more police officers, paired with data-driven technology like CompStat, was the biggest factor. It allowed for more efficient and more focused policing. But policing wasn’t always efficient, and it wasn’t always this professionalized. This era came about after generations of rich and powerful people used police for their own gain. In the early 1900s, police chiefs were appointed by politicians, and police officers often took payoffs. The institution was widely corrupt. But in the 1950s, police leaders pushed back and implemented strategies that gave us the institution we know today. This is what's called the ""professionalization"" of police, which brought about military efficiency and organization of local police, as well as preventative tactics to reduce crime. However, it turns out the point of policing isn’t just to reduce crime numbers. Meares, the Yale law professor, says that while these policing tactic may have reduced crime numbers, it also encouraged aggressive policing — and that destroyed the trust between communities and police, a trust that allows police to do their jobs. ""Research is clear that how people are treated is central to how they view police and other legal authorities — even more than whether police are effective at reducing crime,"" Meares wrote in the Washington Post. ""That’s because people do not simply experience police interactions; they also learn from them."" We had inklings this was true a long time ago, which is partially why ""community policing"" exists. It encourages police to be a part of the neighborhoods they protect in order to rebuild that trust, instead of swooping in to enforce minor violations. But despite huge investments from the federal government, a recent review found that many departments treated community policing as a ""buzzword."" And at police academies in the US, community policing strategies continue to be a small part of the curriculum. When you ask Americans about specific police reforms — like putting body cameras on officers — most support the proposals. But if you ask them about Black Lives Matter, only 14 percent of white people strongly support it, versus 41 percent of black people — even though this movement pushes for many of the same proposals Americans widely support. The difference, however, is that it urges police reform in the context of race. Some Americans are trying to decouple the issues of policing and race, often retorting by saying ""All Lives Matter."" But as the data shows, these two things are linked in such a way that it's silly to talk about police reform while ignoring race. Meanwhile, some Americans believe this movement is a sharp critique of police officers themselves, and not the institution. But Ron Davis, who was director of President Obama’s police task force and served 28 years as an officer, says these are two separate things. ""Even if you have great cops, if the systems are bad, they're still going to have terrible outcomes,"" he said. It's tempting to think that we just need to restore the justice that existed before police brutality came to the limelight. And it was especially tempting after the recent spate of police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota — and the subsequent targeting of police officers. It felt like this problem was spinning out of control. It's a common sentiment, and one that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has embraced. ""We have to give power back to the police because crime is rampant,"" Trump told NBC. But what's crucial to understand is that we've never had this justice before. In fact, the very early days of policing were founded on targeting immigrants, minorities, and the poor. In many cities, early police were often used to rein in labor strikes as work conditions deteriorated. In the South, the root of early law enforcement was slave patrol, responsible for quelling revolts, pursuing runaway slaves, and disciplining slaves who broke plantation rules. Later on, after slavery was outlawed, police enforced Jim Crow laws. In short, law enforcement as an institution has always favored the rich and powerful — and it has always given less value to the lives of the marginalized. Throughout American history, this treatment has created an underclass of people who are criminalized, isolated, and labeled as inherently dangerous, says criminologist Gary Potter. And while overt expressions of racism and classism have mostly faded, there are still enough unspoken hints that create this underclass. Meares writes, ""On the streets, the hidden curriculum of policing can be seen in how people are treated in interactions with law enforcement. Too often this hidden curriculum sends certain citizens signals that they are members of a special, dangerous, and undesirable class."" So when we talk about police reform, what we're trying to figure out is how fair and just law enforcement can exist in America, and how it can be a legitimate institution for everyone, and not a source of fear — all for the very first time.",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/2/12316922/police-legitimacy-cartoon,,Vox
672,672,24-05-18 15:05,2018,5,24,David Roberts,"Meet the microgrid, the technology poised to transform electricity","If we want a livable climate for future generations, we need to slow, stop, and reverse the rise in global temperatures. To do that, we need to stop burning fossil fuels for energy. To do that, we need to generate lots of carbon-free electricity and get as many of our energy uses as possible (including transportation and industry) hooked up to the electricity grid. Electrify everything! We need a greener grid. But that’s not all. The highly digital modern world also demands a more reliable grid, capable of providing high-quality power to facilities like hospitals or data centers, where even brief brownouts can cost money or lives. The renewable energy sources with the most potential — wind and solar — are variable, which means that they come and go on nature’s schedule, not ours. They ramp up and down with the weather, so integrating them into the grid while maintaining (and improving) reliability means finding clever ways to balance out their swings. Finally, recent blackouts in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria highlight the need for a more resilient grid — one that can get back up and running quickly (at least for essential sites) after a disaster or attack. It’s a triple challenge: We need, all at once, a greener, more reliable, more resilient electricity grid. But hark! Lo! There is a technology, or a set of technologies, that promises one day to be a triple solution — to address all three of the grid’s needs at once. We speak of the humble microgrid. Technically, a grid is any combination of power sources, power users, wires to connect them, and some sort of control system to operate it all. Microgrid just means a small, freestanding grid. It can consist of several buildings, one small building (sometimes called a “nanogrid”), or even one person (a “picogrid”) with a backpack solar panel, an iPhone, and some headphones. The research firm GTM counts “1,900 basic and advanced, operational and planned microgrids” in the US, with the market expected to grow quickly. Most microgrids today are basic, one-generator affairs, but more complex microgrids are popping up all over — there’s a cool one in Brooklyn, a cool one on Alcatraz Island, and the coolest one of all in Sonoma, California. Microgrids also play a big role in plans to rebuild Puerto Rico’s grid. Let’s take a quick tour of microgrids and their potential. Some microgrids stand on their own, apart from any larger grid, often in remote rural areas. These off-grid microgrids are a relatively cheap and quick way to secure some access to power for people who now lack it, often more quickly than large, centralized grids can be extended. Most microgrids, especially in wealthier nations, are grid-connected — they are embedded inside a bigger grid, like any other utility customer. All the examples cited above fit this bill. What makes a microgrid a microgrid is that it can flip a switch (or switches) and “island” itself from its parent grid in the event of a blackout. This enables it to provide those connected to it with (at least temporary) backup power. Again, most actually existing microgrids are extremely basic — think of a hospital with a diesel generator in the basement, or a big industrial facility with a combined-heat-and-power (CHP) facility on site that can provide some heat and power during a blackout. Microgrids won’t be a core part of the clean-energy transition until they serve all three grid needs — greener, more reliable, more resilient. Right now, most microgrids around the world rely on diesel generators, which are polluting and loud, so they’re not very green. (In the US, the primary sources are CHP and natural gas.) They only turn on once the grid is down, so they don’t help with day-to-day reliability. Of the three grid needs, most serve only resilience, and only for those lucky enough to be connected to one. As basic as most of them are today, microgrids hold great promise for the future. Technology is rapidly expanding the possibilities. Smart design and software can create microgrids specifically designed to integrate distributed renewable energy, or microgrids designed to provide “six nines” (99.9999 percent) reliability, or microgrids designed for maximum resilience. There are even “nested” microgrids within microgrids. Smarter microgrids can communicate on an ongoing basis with their parent grids, forming a beautiful friendship. By aggregating together distributed, small-scale resources (solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, smart appliances and HVAC systems, etc.), a microgrid can present to the larger grid as a single entity — a kind of Voltron composed of distributed energy technologies. This makes things easier on grid operators. They don’t necessarily relish the idea of communicating directly with millions (or billions) of discrete generators, buildings, and devices. It’s an overwhelming amount of data to assimilate. Microgrids can gather those smaller resources together into discrete, more manageable and predictable chunks. Grid operators can put these chunks to good use. A smart microgrid can provide “grid services” — storing energy when it’s cheap, providing energy when it’s expensive, serving as backup capacity, or smoothing out frequency and voltage fluctuations. [*see footnote] A single smart microgrid, aggregating diverse, distributed low-carbon resources, can provide cheap, clean, reliable power to those within it. It can also provide grid services to the larger grid around it. What really tickles the imagination is a grid that contains dozens or hundreds of networked microgrids — even a grid that is someday composed of networked microgrids. This kind of “modular architecture,” with multiple semi-autonomous nodes operating in parallel, is more secure and efficient than a centralized system with a few, large points of failure. Microgrids may never eliminate the need for large utilities, power plants, and transmission lines, but moving more power generation, management, and consumption under local control makes everyone less dependent on them. And it makes the grid greener, more reliable, and resilient — a three’fer. There are other ways of aggregating small-scale distributed energy resources that do not involve a physical switch that can island them off from the grid. These “virtual” aggregations can gather together multiple small resources (batteries, solar panels, whatever) and treat the result as a single unit that participates in grid-services markets. “Virtual power plants” offer lots of benefits, to participants and to the grid, but they do not offer the core microgrid value proposition: resilience, i.e., independence from the larger grid in times of need. One of us [Dave waves] will be writing more about microgrids soon. In the meantime, there are a gazillion reports floating around.

676,676,23-03-18 17:00,2018,3,23,Steven Blum,Shortages of Injectable Estrogen Are Screwing Over Trans Women,"When Mel Cohen first began injecting estrogen, the benefits were immediate. “It was like night and day,” she says. “I went from being suicidal to having so much energy and a clear head for the first time in a long time.” Hormone therapy, along with facial feminization and gender confirmation surgery, goes a long way towards making male-to-female trans people feel at home in their bodies. Whether injected, swallowed, or applied as a transdermal patch, the medication increases breast tissue, decreases sperm production, thins body hair, and softens skin.  Like other trans women, Mel found that injecting estrogen, rather than taking it in its pill form, resulted in a more dramatic physical transformation in a shorter period of time. “I was starting to see a lot of changes in my body—my hips were finally appearing, and I had some significant breast growth,” she says. “It felt like I was finally having a breakthrough.” But over the past few months, Cohen has been unable to refill her prescription for the drug that’s saved her psyche. She spends her days calling local pharmacies in her newly adopted neighborhood in Pittsburgh as well as in her hometown of Detroit. No pharmacy has injectable estrogen in stock.  Cohen isn’t alone. Across the country, trans people say that their lives have been upended by the sporadic availability of a drug that alleviates their gender dysphoria (or the persistent feeling that their bodies don’t belong to them). While a shortage of the active ingredients used by one brand of injectable estrogen was resolved in 2016, trans people say the broader supply of estrogen still remains frustratingly out of reach in different parts of the country.  “There was a three month period where I could not hear of anyone finding injectable estrogen in the 20/dl dosage,” says Olivia Danforth, a trans primary care physician in Oregon specializing in trans health. “Now, it’s more like scattered, unpredictable scarcity with even less explanation.” The World Professional Association for Transgender Health says hormone therapy is a medical necessity for those with “persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria,” and it can be especially helpful for those who don’t feel comfortable presenting as non-binary. After four months on injections, Lauren Walker says she was starting to feel more like herself. “I finally had thinner body hair and the fat on my face was redistributing,” she says. But when she ran out and was unable to refill her prescription, it felt like a slide back into stasis. “It’s frustrating,” she says. “It’s another setback after years and years of feeling like I have had to compromise my transition due to forces outside my control.”  Those who can’t find injectable estrogen in their zip code are more likely to turn to the black market for DIY injections, relying on dark web marketplaces like Valhalla to refill their medications. Even on Amazon and eBay, you can find “feminizing supplements” for men. One, called “Ova-Glan” promises to help buyers “achieve maximum feminine results.” On Reddit, trans people also look for vials in far-flung cities. “Am I just screwed and need to just go back to tablets?” one comment reads. “Or is there something I'm missing here? Or a prominent pharmacy that I haven't thought of?” In response to inquiries like these, users trade tips on Sam’s Clubs or Rite Aids that haven’t run out of stock yet, discuss how to ration the medications they’ve already secured and share advice on compounding pharmacies, which can produce estrogen injections in-house, but have spotty records with regard to sterility.  The market for estrogen injections is dominated by two manufacturers. Delestrogen, the brand name-version of the drug, is manufactured by Par Pharmaceuticals, while Estradiol Valerate, a generic, is made by Perrigo. In larger cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, Delestrogen seems to be widely available, but it can be prohibitively expensive. Estradiol Valerate, in comparison, is significantly less expensive but seems to be almost completely unavailable. (The FDA’s website lists the drug as “currently in shortage” but provides no further information about when the shortage might be resolved.) More from VICE: Anthony Fortenberry, the chief nursing officer at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, says his clinic is out of generic injectable estrogen and that the patients he serves are having to pay for the brand name version out-of-pocket. “The populations we serve tend to be more disenfranchised and don’t necessarily have the resources to pay out-of-pocket,” he adds. “This is also increases the risk that patients will purchase medications on the street or share with friends and that increases the dangers for many reasons.”  Fortenberry believes distributors favor higher-utilizing markets like New York and that’s why the city hasn’t run out of the brand name version of the drug. “But what that means is that a rural area in Pennsylvania might see a shortage [of both drugs] sooner.” In response to an inquiry from Tonic, a representative for Delestrogen said that the company has “plenty of supply to support the market” while Perrigo, the makers of Estradiol Valerate, said they had “no comment” on claims of a shortage. But in one Reddit post, a user wrote that he received an official response from Perrigo saying that the company had “temporarily discontinued” producing generic estrogen.  Advocacy groups believe pushing the FDA towards approving injectable estrogen for use in feminization therapy would go a long way towards ending these shortages for good. So far, due to lack of funding and interest, there’s a dearth of studies even looking at the benefits of injections over pills. (By contrast, there are over 17 estrogen medications with approval from the FDA for cisgender menopausal women.)  Because of the lack of studies, doctors and patients are forced to rely on anecdotal evidence when deciding between treatments. “You can put two different people on medications and they’ll have radically different timelines and experiences,” Fortenbery says. “Someone might have facial changes, someone might have muscle changes, and someone might not get the results they’re looking for. It’s very specific to the individual.” Rahne Alexander, an artist in Baltimore, has been taking injectable estrogen off-and-on for the past twenty years. “It goes through ebbs and flows, but in recent years we’ve been seeing more of these shortages happening. They come with no real notice—I’ll go to refill my prescription and I just can’t.” She believes injectable estrogen is easier on her liver, “but the lack of stability is a really hard thing. I know I’m not the only one who’s struggling to manage her own stability and mental health throughout this. You know, often it just feels like a very isolating sort of circumstance.” Alexander says the burden is entirely on trans people to lobby and advocate for themselves, a process she calls “exhausting.” Roughly a third of all trans people say they’ve faced discrimination in a doctor’s office, and half say they’ve had to educate their own doctors about hormone replacement therapy. Those in rural areas are often at the greatest disadvantage.  In the past, when she’s run out of meds, Alexander says she’s felt despondent, “like everything was moving slower. It was harder just to connect with people and do the things I needed to do in any given day.”  “I’m in an apocalyptic headspace these days,” she adds. “I wonder what will happen when the few companies making these injections just stop. Because we’re such a small population, if a company decided they didn’t want to support us anymore, they could just do that. And what do we do then? If they’re not being regulated or compelled to serve us with this thing we need, what are we going to do?”  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of Tonic delivered to your inbox weekly.

677,677,28-09-17 00:00,2017,9,28,Reuters Staff,Health Secretary Price believes has president's confidence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said on Thursday he believed he still had President Trump’s confidence, a day after the president said he was not happy with Price over reports he had used private planes for official travel.  “I think we’ve still got the confidence of the president,” Price told reporters who asked whether he expected to be fired over the matter.  “We’re going to work through this,” he said, following a public event in Washington about the flu season.  Price has taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to taxpayers of about $300,000, according to Politico, which first reported the travel. Trump said on Wednesday he was looking into the matter, as is a U.S. House of Representatives committee.  HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said on Wednesday that Price has “heard the criticism and concerns” over his travel, adding, “he takes that very seriously and has taken it to heart.”   She added that Price has initiated an internal departmental review of travel procedures. The HHS inspector general has also announced a review of Price’s travel on chartered aircraft.   Two other senior U.S. officials also face scrutiny over their travels.   The Treasury Department’s Inspector General is reviewing the circumstances of Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky in August for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip.   Mnuchin was asked Thursday on the “CBS This Morning” program  if he would promise to ride commercial airlines for the rest of his tenure as Treasury secretary.  “I can promise the American taxpayer the only time that I will be using (military) air is when there are issues either for national security or where we have to get various different things (and) there’s no other means,” he said.  The frequent travels of Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to Oklahoma are being investigated by that agency’s inspector general.  The Washington Post reported Thursday that Pruitt is said to have taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid-February, costing taxpayers more than $58,000.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-price/health-secretary-price-believes-has-presidents-confidence-idUSKCN1C325C,Politics,Reuters
678,678,07-06-17 12:50,2017,6,7,Rebecca Tan,One of the London attackers was in a British documentary on Islamic extremism,"A 2016 British documentary about Islamist extremism in the UK is roaring back into the news for a surprising and profoundly depressing reason: Two militants featured in the film, including one responsible for Saturday’s lethal assault in central London, have now gone on to carry out terror attacks in the name of Islamic extremism. Khuram Shazad Butt, now known to be “a heavyweight figure” in the UK-based extremist group al-Muhajiroun, was the leader of the three terrorists who rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge with a van on Saturday. He appears briefly in a Channel 4 documentary titled — believe it or not — The Jihadis Next Door. This film is chilling even without knowing that you’re watching two people who are now known terrorists. Figures in the film who are identified as bus drivers, waiters, and business owners exchange blows with British police and give ominous warnings to the public that “things have to change.” Butt appears at 14:49 in the documentary. He’s shown following an extremist Muslim preacher known as Abu Haleema into Regent’s Park and asking out loud if “anyone’s got a smartphone” so the group can use the compass to determine the direction for prayer. Later, Butt helps set up a black flag (a common symbol for Islamic militancy and now notoriously co-opted by the Islamic State) on top of a speaker before lining up in a row with six other men to participate in a prayer ritual led by Haleema, who chants, “Allahu Akbar” (Arabic for “God is the greatest”) out loud. Let’s just take a moment to digest this: Butt was not only living in the UK but was literally in the public eye, openly advocating extremist views. More than 1.2 million people watched this documentary when it was released, which raises a disturbing question: How did the British police miss this? This question is even more baffling considering this isn’t even the first time that people from The Jihadis Next Door have gone on to commit acts of terror. Abu Rumaysah, one of the film’s central characters, was named by an official source to the BBC as an ISIS executioner in January 2016. In an ISIS propaganda video released last year, a masked man holding a gun mocks former British Prime Minister David Cameron before shooting five supposed “British spies” in the back of the head. According to Rumaysah’s sister, the audio from the clip resembles him, reported the BBC. So to recap: Two would-be terrorists appear in a 2016 British documentary openly declaring their support for Islamic extremism. One of them (Rumaysah) was arrested for spreading terrorism and then released on bail. He wasn’t supposed to have his passport, but managed to flee to Syria anyway, becoming an executioner for ISIS and leaving the British police to pick up the pieces. And after all this, it doesn’t seem that the British police paid any more attention to the documentary or the people in it. Haleema, the preacher from the film, was still active on his YouTube channel as of 11 months ago. And now Butt, as we know, has gone on to commit an unthinkable act of terror, killing 8 people and injuring over 40. It’s terrifying to think about who else might have slipped under the radar of the British police, but now, as before, the people leading the UK’s anti-terrorism efforts don’t seem willing to take accountability for this. After Rumaysah was reported as an ISIS executioner, people wondered how he was even able to leave the UK when he was still on bail, let alone join ISIS in Syria. David Anderson QC, a lawyer appointed by the government to provide independent reviews of the UK’s anti-terrorism law to Parliament, said to the BBC in 2016, ""There are thousands of people who are subjects of interest. I don't know how high up the list this person was — I suspect not very near the top.” On Monday, Mark Rowley, the UK’s top counterterrorism officer, said almost exactly the same thing about Butt. Even though MI5 had been aware of the Pakistan-born terrorist, opened an investigation into him in 2015, and received multiple calls from the public about his extremism, it decided to move Butt into the “lower echelons” of counterterrorism investigations, Rowley said. He added, “I have seen nothing yet that a poor decision was made.” The UK police seemed to have missed clear red flags on both Butt and Rumaysah, but this doesn’t mean there is a simple answer for what lies ahead. Small-scale and relatively isolated terrorist attacks like the one on Saturday are very hard to stop. Their perpetrators are more volatile and tend to pull together attack plots quickly, leaving the police with less time to uncover them. This is only made more difficult by funding cuts. In March, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, an independent watchdog group for the UK police, said funding cuts have left the police in a “potentially perilous state.” This came up again on Monday when Prime Minister Theresa May dodged questions on whether the police are receiving the resources they need. Given these new constraints and challenges, it’s worth noting that the British police have done a relatively good job of weeding out terrorists: Police have reportedly disrupted five domestic terrorist plots since March. But this latest attack shows how much more the police still have to do to confront the threat. Watching this documentary — and finding out how they let it slip past them — might be a good place to start.",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/7/15746186/terrorism-london-jihadists-next-door-british-police,,Vox
679,679,02-01-17 05:30,2017,1,2,DJ Pangburn,Supernatural Monsters Haunt in a Floating World," The landscape of Japanese myth is populated with all manner of ghosts, demons, the dead, and odd creatures, much of it detailed in several centuries worth of Ukiyo-e art. In Ronin Gallery’s latest exhibition, Ghosts, Demons and the Bizarre, dozens of woodblock prints and paintings by Japanese artists, including masters Kuniyoshi and Yoshitosi, explore the more fantastical realms of the imaginative art form known as Ukiyo-e or “pictures of the floating world”.  As Ronin Gallery’s David Taro Libertson tells The Creators Project, Ukiyo-e typically featured landscapes, beautiful women, nature, and famous fictional or historical figures, but these pictures of the floating world also included Yokai or ghosts, which were among the art form’s most common subjects.  “The term Yokai comes from the Japanese symbols for weird or strange and are a class of supernatural monsters prevalent in Japanese folklore,” Libertson says. “While Yokai are depicted as having the capacity to bring good fortune and act as nightmarish omens, they are almost universally depicted as mischievous bordering on comical.”  “More often than not they appear as something vaguely humanoid with animal traits,” he adds. “However, there are many Yokai that look like household objects and even some that have no tangible appearance at all.”  Ukiyo-e, as Libertson explains, originated in China. The woodblock printmaking arrived in Japan alongside Buddhism during the 6th century. Though the technique was used to communicate Buddhist scripture, by the 17th century printmaking served as a medium in the country’s artistic renaissance.  This coincided with the ruling power lying in Edo (modern day Tokyo) during the Tokugawa Shogunate, which was based in Kyoto. Merchants and consumers flowed into Edo at this time. And since they were barred from entering Japan’s samurai culture, the townspeople (chonin), developed their own culture—the “floating world”—which revolved around kabuki theaters and Yoshiwra, Edo’s legalized prostitution district. Ukiyo-e, or pictures of the floating world, emerged around 1660 in the form of monochrome prints, and tended to have erotic themes.  Libertson says this primitive period, with masters like Moronubu and Masanobu, were known for elegant and vital lines. By 1700, the first color prints emerged, which were hand-colored with vegetable-based pigments. A costly process, these pigments were replaced in 1765 by full color prints, and by 1810 artists were depicting actors as individuals rather than roles.  Because the Tenpo Reforms forbid depictions of Edo’s brightest stars in the mid-19th century, Libertson says that famous place pictures (Meisho-e) filled the gap. Around the same time, easing of travel restrictions and the ubiquity of landscape prints—like those by Hokusai and Hiroshige, both of whom appear in the exhibition—fueled what Libertson calls a national wanderlust.  “Alongside Meisho-e, Yokai (legendary prints of ghosts, spirits, magic, etc) and Musha-e (warrior prints) sidestepped the Tenpo restrictions,” Libertson says. “As the Tokugawa Shogunate weakened, anti-authoritarian legends gained popularity. After the fall of the shogunate and the rise of the Meiji Emperor in the early 20th century, woodblock printmaking became a medium of politicization and propaganda. Western clothing and inventions spoke to the rapid modernization avidly encouraged by the emperor.”  One of the undisputed masters of Ukiyo-e is Kuniyoshi Utagawa, and several of his works appear in Ghosts, Demons and the Bizarre. Born in Edo to a silk dyer, Kuniyoshi first studied art under Shunei, then began studying woodblock printing under Toyokuni I at age 14. Three years later he left Toyokuni’s studio to work as an independent artist.  In 1827, Kuniyoshi released his dramatic series 108 Heroes of the Suikoden, which depicted famous samurai and other legendary heroes of Japan. The public loved the work, so Kuniyoshi began championing the fierce and fantastical in his brand of Ukiyo-e.  “He had a ravenous imagination and the full scope of his work reveals an aesthetic sensibility capable of assimilating almost any experience,” says Libertson. “No doubt, however, his particular genius felt most at home in the world of martial glory, where epic battles decided the fate of empires and fierce warriors clashed to the death. His imagery was so popular in his time that he received requests for tattoo designs.”  Yoshitoshi Tsukioka lived a more tumultuous life. One of the last great masters of Ukiyo-e, he studied under Yosai, and suffered several mental breakdowns, one of which resulted in a stay at the Sugamo Asylum. Yoshitoshi’s breakthrough came in 1885 with 100 Aspects of the Moon, a series of 100 beautifully rendered prints that explored Japanese and Chinese legend with old and new techniques as Japan was rapidly modernizing.  “Yoshitoshi’s work is known for its eerie and imaginative component,” Libertson says. “His considerable imagination and originality imbued his prints with a sensitivity and honesty rarely seen in Ukiyo-e of this time period. From ghost stories to folktales, graphic violence to the gentle glow of the moon, Yoshitoshi not only offers compositional and technical brilliance, but also unfettered passion.”  The imagination and technical ability included in Ghosts, Demons and the Bizarre is often stunning, as is the range of the works’ subject matter. Horiyoshi III’s Namakubi in Winter will gross viewers out with its depiction of a decapitated head hung from a tree. But the next minute they will be astounded by something like the spectral beauty of Yūshin’s double exposure-esque Ghost Lanterns. Whatever the reaction, viewers will enjoy this look back at Japan’s rich artistic history. Click here fore more information on the works in Ronin Gallery’s Ghosts, Demons and the Bizarre exhibition.

681,681,07-09-16 15:30,2016,9,7,German Lopez,Want to end mass incarceration? This poll should worry you.,"Do Americans really want to end mass incarceration? Or do they simply want to cut prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders? These are two different questions: Although much of the focus on prison reform over the past few years has gone to nonviolent drug offenders, the rapid growth of the US prison population since the 1960s — which put America above even Russia and China in incarceration — was actually driven by longer sentences for violent crime. A new poll by Morning Consult and Vox gives some insight: Americans agree there are too many people in prison — but they’re only willing to cut sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, not violent criminals. The survey of more than 2,000 registered voters posed several questions regarding mass incarceration. Some tested understanding: “To the best of your knowledge are each of the following statements true or false? Since 1990, 60 percent of the growth in state prison populations has come from violent offenders.” (This is true.) Other questions gauged general views: “Do you support or oppose reducing prison time for … people who committed a violent crime and have a low risk of committing another crime?” The answers revealed not just Americans’ attitudes toward incarceration but also what they don’t understand about the prison system. For example, voters overestimate how many people are in prison for nonviolent drug offenses while underestimating — or at least not knowing — that most of the growth in state prisons was driven by sentences for violent crime. And that has seemingly influenced their attitudes to focus on cutting incarceration only when it comes to drugs and other nonviolent offenses. The findings suggest that Americans are willing to cut back on some incarceration — just not the level that reformers have put forward with #Cut50, the bipartisan goal to reduce the overall prison population by 50 percent over the next 10 years. This has huge implications for policy: If US politicians move to dethrone the US as the world’s leader in incarceration (with only the small African nation of Seychelles boasting a higher imprisonment rate), they could face very stiff opposition from the public. America leads the world in incarceration. It holds the largest prison population in the world at more than 2.2 million, above China and Russia’s reported numbers. It also has the highest imprisonment rate among major countries: 693 prisoners for every 100,000 people. In comparison, Russia is at 451, China is at 118, the United Kingdom is below 150, Canada is at 114, France is at 103, and Germany is at 76. These statistics are why the #Cut50 goal exists: To get anywhere close to other major countries’ levels, the US would really need to cut its prison population by 50 percent. The Vox/Morning Consult poll found Americans are vaguely aware of their country’s high incarceration rates. About 47 percent said it’s true that “22 percent of the world’s prisoners are in the United States,” and 51 percent said there are too many people in prison in the US. About 52 percent also said that the following statement comes closer to their view: “One out of every 100 American adults is in prison. That’s too many, and it costs too much. There are more effective, less expensive alternatives to prison for nonviolent offenders and expanding those alternatives is the best way to reduce the crime rate.” Things get a little murkier, however, when American voters are asked about specifics. For starters, 61 percent of respondents said that nearly half of all prisoners in the US are incarcerated for drug offenses. Self-identified liberals, who are more likely to back prison sentencing reform, were more likely than self-identified conservatives to hold this view by a 6-point margin. That 61 percent is wrong: Drug offenses are indeed a significant contributor, making up about 21 percent of the jail and prison population. But the most common offenses are violent crimes (like murder, assault, and robbery), which nearly 40 percent of the prison population is in for. The remaining are property crimes, public order offenses, and other low-level violations. Seemingly putting all of these beliefs together, the great majority of voters said they support reducing prison time for nonviolent criminal offenders: 78 percent said that “people who committed a nonviolent crime and have a low risk of committing another crime” should be let out of prison earlier. Only 32 percent said the same of nonviolent criminals who had “a high risk of committing another crime.” Again, liberals were more likely to support letting nonviolent criminals out of prison early: 86 percent of liberals said that they support letting nonviolent criminals with a low risk of reoffending out of prison earlier, compared with 75 percent of conservatives. And 43 percent of liberals supported letting nonviolent criminals with a high risk of reoffending out of prison early, compared with 26 percent of conservatives. These are fairly high levels of support, especially among liberals, for reducing prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses — perhaps as a result of the belief that those in prison for these crimes are driving too much incarceration. But the story looks very different when violent crimes — again, the major cause of mass incarceration — are up for question. Most Americans don’t know that the growing number of people locked up for violent offenses drove 60 percent of the growth since 1990 in state prisons, where 86 percent of US prison inmates reside. Asked about this, 29 percent of voters wrongly said it was false, and 37 percent said they didn’t know or offered no opinion. Combined with most Americans agreeing that nearly half of the US prison population is nonviolent drug offenders, the poll suggests that most Americans don’t know that the major cause of mass incarceration is harsher sentencing for violent offenses. Possibly because of this, Americans are very unwilling to let violent offenders out of prison early. Only 29 percent said they support reducing prison time for “people who committed a violent crime and have a low risk of committing another crime.” And 27 percent said they support reducing prison time for violent offenders who “have a high risk of committing another crime.” Majorities rejected the idea of reducing sentences for both types of violent offenders. To put these numbers in context, there’s more support (32 percent) for reducing the prison sentence of nonviolent criminals with a high risk of reoffending than there is for cutting the sentence of violent criminals with a low risk of reoffending. Even the majority of liberals oppose reducing prison sentences for violent criminals with a low risk of reoffending: 55 percent oppose it, versus 42 percent who support. Conservatives are overwhelmingly against the idea: 68 percent oppose it, versus 23 percent who support. In fact, no majority of any group — whether divided by race, religion, ideology, political party, employment, or any other category evaluated by Morning Consult — supported reducing prison sentences for violent criminals with a low risk of committing another crime. Similarly, while 55 percent said they support reducing sentences for drug offenses, only 24 percent said the same for crimes in general. One potential reason: About 55 percent of voters said that one acceptable reason to reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders is “to keep room for violent offenders in prisons.” In other words, cutting back on the incarceration of drug offenders is seen as good partly because it lets the government lock up more violent offenders. Part of this may be driven by voters’ unawareness that violent crime has dramatically dropped over the past couple of decades. Asked if the national rate of violent crime has decreased by 49 percent since 1991, 25 percent said it’s true, while 41 percent said it’s false, and 33 percent didn’t know or offered no opinion. (Gallup reports similar findings every year.) Whatever the reason, the general point is clear: Americans are simply not interested in cutting prison sentences for violent offenders. To anyone who wants to truly end mass incarceration, all of these numbers should be concerning. As this great interactive from the Marshall Project shows, it’s not possible to halve the state prison population — the bulk of the US prison system — without releasing some violent criminals, even if you choose to release everyone for lower-level crimes like drug dealing and theft (an unrealistic goal, to say the least): This reflects the reality of how mass incarceration happened. From the 1960s through ’90s, crime in America was unusually high: The murder rate peaked at 10.2 in 1980, compared with 4.5 in 2013 and 2014. Unsurprisingly, Americans back then were much more likely, based on Gallup’s surveys, to say crime was “the most important problem.” Lawmakers reacted with mass incarceration, vastly increasing the prison sentences for nearly every type of crime. This policy prescription wasn’t very effective. There is no historical correlation between higher incarceration rates and dropping crime rates — incarceration rose steeply for two decades before crime began to fall, as scholar William Stuntz documented in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice. And a 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration explained 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, while other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’90s. (There are many other theories for why violent crime fell by roughly half in this time period.) At the same time, incarceration costs the US about $80 billion each year, according to the Hamilton Project. At the same time, mass incarceration has ravaged certain communities. Black people are nearly six times as likely to be locked up as their white peers (with about 61 to 80 percent of that explained by higher crime rates in black communities). As a result, for every 100 black women out of prison, there are just 83 black men — what a New York Times analysis described as “1.5 million missing black men,” who could be fathers or workers for their communities but instead are behind bars. So America locks up more people up than any other country in the world — even though there’s no evidence it’s an effective policy to fight crime and there’s evidence that it’s destroying some communities. Yet based on the views of respondents to Vox and Morning Consult’s poll, it looks likely to remain that way — because Americans are okay with it. Morning Consult polled 2,001 registered voters on September 1 and 2, 2016. The interviews were conducted using large, established online survey vendors and were weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, region, annual household income, home ownership status, and marital status. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.

682,682,26-04-17 00:00,2017,4,26,David Gilbert,"Erdoğan is still arresting his opponents in massive purge that has surpassed 113,000 people","The Turkish government continued its crackdown on people it suspects of conspiring to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a failed coup attempt last July. On Wednesday the country’s interior minister announced the arrests of over 1,000 members of the country’s police force and accused them of being “secret imams” loyal to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen. The early-morning raids came just 10 days after Erdoğan narrowly won a controversial referendum that critics in Turkey and abroad warn could transform the Turkish government into an outright autocracy.  Besides the 1,009 arrests made on Wednesday, Turkish authorities issued another 2,215 arrest warrants for suspected supporters of Gülen who are hiding among what they believe to be a secret network inside the police force. Suspects are located in all 81 Turkish provinces, with 390 of them in Istanbul alone. Prior to Wednesday’s arrests, figures from the Turkish Interior Ministry showed that 113,260 people in total had been arrested or detained since the failed coup nine months ago, which left 248 people dead. Of that number, almost 47,000 have been arrested on specific charges. Those arrested include members of the police, military,and judiciary, as well as civil servants and journalists. Erdoğan’s crackdown also extends to the media, with 179 outlets being shuttered in 2016 alone. Dubbed the Gulenist Terrorist Organisation, or FETO, by the Turkish government, supporters of Gülen have borne the blame for July’s failed coup. And Erdoğan is now pledging to “cleanse” them from all sections of society.

And Erdoğan is now pledging to “cleanse” them from all sections of society. “We are trying to cleanse members of FETO inside the armed forces, inside the judiciary, and inside the police,” Erdoğan said just before the raids on Wednesday, Reuters reported. “We are going to keep up the fight in terms of democracy, fundamental rights, and liberties, but at the same time we are going to keep up the fight against PKK, FETO, and other terrorist organizations such as Daesh [the Islamic State group]. We will continue down this path in a very committed fashion.” Fethullah Gulen, who now resides in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, was once a staunch ally of Erdoğan, but that relationship soured in 2013 when Erdoğan accused Gülen of being behind corruption investigations. He’s currently on Turkey’s most-wanted-terrorist list and the government is demanding his extradition from the U.S. Gülen denies any part in the coup, instead suggesting the entire incident was carried out by Erdoğan himself in order to cement his own position. “What other explanation is there for arrest warrants for thousands of judges, prosecutors, and police officers being ready within hours of a coup attempt?” Gülen said at the time. Despite consistent requests by the Turkish government to extradite Gülen, the U.S. government has asked for evidence to back up the arrest warrant — something the Turkish government has so far failed to provide. Erdoğan’s referendum victory is still being contested by opposition forces, who allege vote-rigging, while independent observers have slammed the election’s lack of transparency. One member of an EU delegation sent to observe the vote called it “unfair and unfree.” On Wednesday, a leading member of the EU Parliament, responsible for dealings with Ankara, said the constitutional changes provided by the referendum are cause for the formal suspension of talks on Turkey’s membership of the group. “As Turkey with such a constitution cannot become a member of the EU, it also doesn’t make sense to continue the discussion on integration with the current government,” Kati Piri, a Dutch lawmaker, said. “The EU should officially suspend the accession talks if the constitutional changes are implemented unchanged.”",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9kdvx7/erdogan-is-still-arresting-his-opponents-in-massive-purge-that-has-surpassed-113000-people,,Vice News
683,683,27-06-19 00:00,2019,6,27,,Facebook CEO says delay in flagging fake Pelosi video was 'execution mistake',"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said his social media company took too long to flag as false an altered video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that appeared to show the Democratic Representative slurring and tripping through a speech.  Zuckerberg, speaking at a conference in Aspen, Colorado, said the slow response was “an execution mistake on our side.”  The video, a type of realistic alteration known as a “deepfake,” was slowed to make Pelosi’s speech seem slurred and edited to make it appear that she repeatedly stumbled over her words. After the video surfaced last month, it was widely shared on Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube.  YouTube took down the video, citing policy violations, but Facebook did not remove the clip, only limiting its distribution and telling users trying to share it that it might be misleading.  “It took a while for our system to flag the video and for our fact checkers to rate it as false... and during that time it got more distribution than our policies should have allowed,” Zuckerberg said.  Pelosi criticized Facebook’s refusal to remove the video and said the incident had convinced her the company knowingly enabled Russian election interference.   Misinformation through altered videos is a rising concern in  the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to produce clips that look genuine and realistically appear to show people saying words they have not spoken. The term “deepfake” is a combination of “deep learning” and “fake.”  After the Pelosi video, Zuckerberg himself was portrayed in a spoof deepfake video on Instagram in which he appears to say “whoever controls the data, controls the future.” Facebook, which owns Instagram, did not to take down the video.  Zuckerberg said Facebook is considering developing a specific policy on deepfakes.  “This is a little bit of sausage making here because we are going through the policy process of thinking through what the deepfake policy should be,” he said. “This is certainly an important area as the AI technology gets better.”  Reporting by Uday Sampath and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru, Katie Paul in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby",https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-deepfake/facebook-ceo-says-delay-in-flagging-fake-pelosi-video-was-execution-mistake-idUSL4N23X4QF,Business News,Reuters
684,684,21-09-18 00:00,2018,9,21,Deena ElGenaidi,The View from the NY Art Book Fair Zine Tent: 8 Zines You Want to Know About,"This year’s zinesters brought some of the most playful, provocative, and interesting items on display, and here are some notable picks. Upon entering Printed Matter’s NY Art Book Fair at the Museum of Modern Art Ps1 for the first time, I was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer size of the event, with room after room of books, publishers, and artworks. The program alone, with its long list exhibitors, was enough to make my head spin. But after doing a quick walk-through of the space and learning a bit about the different rooms in this old public school building, I ventured towards the domed, white tents outside. Having arrived somewhat early, I witnessed the bustling energy of people setting up their tables and preparing for the night ahead. If you do end up at the NY Art Book Fair this weekend, I highly recommend checking out the following tables and their incredible zines. The Press Press table is off in its own room, right across from the Dome, where some of the other zines are located. I was immediately compelled by the independent publisher’s story because of their dedication to working with immigrant communities. Founded by Kimi Hanauer in 2014, Press Press’s mission is to give a voice to those who have been suppressed or misrepresented, focusing primarily on immigration. The project began when Hanauer started to volunteer at the Refugee Youth Project (RYP) in Baltimore, teaching ESL creative writing workshops. The four core members of Press Press — Hanauer, Bomin Jeon (whom I spoke with), Valentina Cabezas, and Bilphena Yahwon — continue to work with the RYP, along with refugee and immigrant communities in their home base of Baltimore, primarily. Contributors to their zines include those immigrant communities, friends, and “random people [who] hit us up,” said Jeon. Jeon described their publishing process as “very collaborative.” The work that Press Press is doing seems particularly important at this moment in time. Over in the zine tent is a group called the Mujeristas Collective. Founded by Stephanie P. Aliaga in January 2017, the Collective’s mission is to provide a platform for Latinx women to share their art. I spoke with Denisse Juliana Jimenez and Yovanna Roa-Reyes, who told me that as a group, they feel strongly about feminism and inclusivity for women of color, and through their zines, they hope to feature the voices of women of color, particularly Latinx women, who are their main consumers. Right next to the Mujeristas Collective table is a table for The Oxnard Plain Press, a small press of zines and artist books founded by Jaime Bailon five years ago. Bailon got started by printing his own artist book and found that the process was “easy and cheap,” so he bought a Xerox printer and began to publish both his own zines and the zines of other artists. “There was no real way to show my work that I felt satisfied with,” said Bailon. “I also realized there wasn’t a way for other people to.” From there, Bailon created a collective with his studio partner, Brian Paumier, and they began to offer mentorships and community critiques. Also at the table with Bailon was artist Jack Adams, who was selling his first-ever zine thanks to Oxnard Plain. #BLKGRLSWURLD describes itself as “a music zine for women who rock.” Founded by Christina Long and her younger sister Courtney Long, #BLKGRLSWURLD came into being, according to Christina, because “people are always telling us there are no women of color interested in metal.” The zine aims to expose the world to the fact that heavy metal music is diverse, said Christina. The press is based in Harlem, and their zine reports primarily on the New York City metal scene, though Christina says some of the best underground music can be found in the suburbs and on Long Island. I was initially drawn to the Ink Cap Press table by their offer of free basil with every zine purchase. Ink Cap Press, however, is much more than free basil. They are a group of activists (Kimberly Enjoli, Essye Klempner, Thompson Harris, and Babbie Dunnington) who came together to make protest art and print that art in zines. They are Black Lives Matter activists, anti-capitalists, and so much more. “Equality is at the heart of our activism,” said Dunnington. They’ve been printing art for two years, but the zine is new, and according to Harris, they’re an “ad-hoc mixture of radical activism hybridized with art.” I purchased a zine of migration poems by Abby Rojas, but their zines were varying and multifaceted, covering a large scope of issues. Continuing in the vein of political activism is Cassandra Press, a zine publisher rooted in the origin story of Cassandra, the Greek mythological figure whose prophecies were never believed. I spoke with Taylor Doran, one of the founding members of Cassandra Press, who told me that the group, which consists of herself, Jordan Nassar, and Kandis Williams, “wanted to have a space for lo-fi political activism.” They are based in New York and Los Angeles, and their zines are by all different artists. They also publish what they call “Readers,” which Doran told me is “like a college reader” on topics such as misogynoir and PTSD. A press that immediately drew me to their table, covered in pink and purple with Rihanna pins and fanny packs that read “DESTROY ALL MEN WHO ABUSE THEIR POWER,” was The Bettys. When I first arrived at the table, the founder, Aurora Diaz, had stepped away, but something told me to come back, as this was a collective that seemed worth talking to. And sure enough, it was. Diaz founded The Bettys six years ago as an art collective for “non-male artists.” Five years ago, Diaz published her first zine and realized that she was looking for a platform for underrepresented artists, so she decided to create her own. The Bettys are based in northern New Jersey, and the artists they publish all come to the collective through invitation or pitches, and more importantly, the Bettys pay an honorarium to the artists, funded through the sale of merch. Each zine has a specific theme, with the most recent one being “Fruit.” Others include “Roses,” “Space Bar,” “Girl Paradise,” and “Feeling Myself.” The Bettys is definitely a table worth checking out. Finally, as a cat person myself, I couldn’t help but stop at the table covered in cat art. Homocats started in 2010 as a series of political cat memes. “It’s all my own drawings,” said founder J. Morrison. When I asked why cats, Morrison responded, “I’m like a crazy cat lady,” at which point I showed him my own cat tattoo. Homocats publishes an annual zine filled with art and commentary such as, “We are disgusted with American ideals,” and “We are tired of homophobia.” Morrison said he has found that “animal lovers tend to be more political because they care more.” Homocats will be at the NY Art Book Fair all weekend and at DragCon next weekend, so be sure to check them out.",https://hyperallergic.com/461690/zines-nyabf-2018/,,Hyperallergic

686,686,10-02-16 01:01,2016,2,10,Andrew Prokop,Bernie Sanders just easily won the New Hampshire primary. It's a remarkable achievement.,"The political revolution has arrived in New Hampshire, as Bernie Sanders easily defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's Democratic primary, according to calls by multiple networks. Sanders's victory — which would have been all but unimaginable a year ago — is a truly remarkable achievement for a ""democratic socialist"" who began the campaign as a mere blip in the polls, little-known nationally and lacking any party establishment support whatsoever. The Vermont senator's triumph is a testament to the power of his economics-focused message, to his supporters' enthusiasm and organization, and to his wild popularity among young voters. It's also a stinging rejection of the Democratic establishment and Hillary Clinton by primary voters in the Granite State. And it's a strong follow-up to Sanders's tie with Clinton in last week's Iowa caucuses. Some will argue that Sanders's win isn't that big a deal, since he's from the neighboring state of Vermont, and it's long been known that Sanders does well among the white Democrats overrepresented in New Hampshire. Yet it's worth remembering that when 2015 began, Sanders trailed Clinton by around 40 points in the Granite State. And though tonight's votes are still being counted, the early calls in Sanders favor suggest that it isn't even close. Still, all this doesn't mean Sanders is favored to win the Democratic nomination. To pull that off, there's one big thing he still needs to do: hugely improve his numbers among the nonwhite voters who are so crucial to the party's coalition nationally. In the coming days, we'll see whether he can make that happen. Back in September 2014, I watched Sanders hold a town hall at Waterloo, Iowa, and candidly discuss his misgivings about the presidential campaign he was considering. ""I have to be realistic,"" he told the crowd. ""I don't want to run and make a fool of myself, or, most importantly, do a disservice to all of the ideas that are needed. Believe me, if I ran with this program in a campaign and did very poorly, it would be a disservice to those ideas."" He continued: ""So if you do it, you've got to do it well and do it to win. That's tough stuff! That is very, very tough stuff."" By now it's safe to say that Sanders's worst fears weren't vindicated. Far from it — instead, his campaign has done wildly better than practically any political observer predicted, and is helping shape the future of the Democratic Party. A longtime independent and ""democratic socialist,"" Sanders is calling for the Democratic Party to move to the left on economic and domestic policy issues — embracing single-payer health care, funding college tuition for all Americans, and hiking government spending on infrastructure and Social Security benefits. And he's argued that because recent Democratic leaders have been too centrist and too reliant on fundraising from business interests, the American public has lost faith that the party will fight for them. If his campaign's success is any indication, a lot of the party's voters find this critique really convincing. Sanders has proved popular enough to raise massive amounts of money from small donors, enough to let him go toe to toe with Clinton, who's backed by the entire Democratic establishment. And his supporters showed up to New Hampshire polls in droves on Tuesday. Over the past few months, I've interviewed dozens of Sanders supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire. And when I asked them why they supported Sanders, several common themes came up. First, there was a belief that something is very wrong with America, and that serious change is required to fix it. The underwhelming economy, growing wealth inequality, and the disproportionate power of corporations and the superrich came up again and again. ""I'm supporting Bernie because of his commitment to changing the dynamic in Washington, dealing with this wealth inequality, and helping people at the bottom,"" said Fran Berman of Exeter, New Hampshire. Secondly, they argued that Sanders's campaign and his call for a political revolution presented the possibility of major change. ""The status quo will only make changes that benefit the people in power,"" Bob Moore of East Kingston, New Hampshire, told me. ""We either do this or we become more oligarchic, so I don't think our democracy has any other choice,"" said Ron Yarnell of Johnston, Iowa. And finally, many said they simply trusted Sanders more than Clinton and the Democratic establishment. ""This guy believes in what he says. And he speaks from his heart, and you can believe in what he says,"" said David Lancaster of Hopkinton, New Hampshire. ""All you can think of with Hillary is, she’s going, 'What are the polls and what are my political advisers telling me I should be saying?'"" Yet Sanders still hasn't answered the biggest question of his campaign: Can he broaden his appeal beyond white Democrats? As Dylan Matthews has written, the populations of Iowa and New Hampshire are both more than 87 percent white — and the United States as a whole is just 62 percent white. Furthermore, nonwhite voters make up an even larger share of the Democratic coalition, since so many more of them lean Democrat than Republican. And Clinton has been clobbering Sanders among nonwhite Democrats. In a recent NBC News/SurveyMonkey national poll, Sanders beat Clinton by 2 points among white Democrats, but trailed her by 43 points among black Democrats and by 34 points among Hispanics. The question, then, is whether these numbers will change. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, I spoke to Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), an African American member of Congress who has endorsed Sanders, and he made the case that the senator's class-focused message will indeed appeal to black and Hispanic voters. ""Think about it,"" Ellison said. ""Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is going to help mostly women, people of color, and low-income people. When you look at who’s on student debt, clearly a lot of white students have it, but proportionately a lot of black and brown voters have more."" He continued: ""The truth is that in America we have race and we have class, but they’re separate things that overlap a lot."" Sanders's main problem, Ellison believed, was just that he needed more ""exposure."" He went on: ""The black community and brown community have known Hillary Clinton since the ‘90s. So she has quite an advantage in this area. Her husband was fairly popular among African Americans and other people, so she has a built-in advantage. I think Bernie is going to be able to solve his exposure problem by continuing to do the things that he’s doing."" The Vermont senator's tie in Iowa and win in New Hampshire will ensure he'll get a tremendous amount of that exposure in the coming days and weeks. His real first tests among nonwhite Democrats will be the Nevada caucuses, on February 20, and the South Carolina primary, on February 27. And if he manages to do well in those, it will be clear that Hillary Clinton's campaign is in very deep trouble.",https://www.vox.com/2016/2/9/10955298/new-hampshire-primary-results-bernie-sanders-wins,,Vox

Norway's sovereign wealth fund is financed by the proceeds of the country's petroleum industry. Related: The World's Largest Sovereign Wealth Fund Will No Longer Invest in Coal Companies Both ExxonMobil and Chevron are urging shareholders to vote against the resolution. Chevron's board said in a statement notifying shareholders of its annual meeting on May 25 that the company shares concerns about climate change and recognizes that fossil fuel burning contributes to increased amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But, the board added, the proposal is based on ""the flawed premise that a global agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius requires each individual fossil fuel producer to curtail development of resources proportionately."" Over 170 nations have agreed to a UN climate change pact that aims to keep global temperature rise to within 2C (3.4 Fahrenheit) compared to the mid-19th century by committing to rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and ramping up cleaner forms of energy production. Exxon's board also opposes the shareholder resolution and, in an April statement to shareholders, the company said it ""is confident that the Company's robust planning and investment processes adequately contemplate and address climate change related risks."" Exxon had initially refused to even allow a vote on the resolution, which was submitted by the $180 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund — the third largest public pension fund in the United States. But the US Securities and Exchange Commission ruled in March that the company was obliged to put the resolution to a shareholder vote. Neither Chevron nor Exxon responded to a request for comment. Related: ExxonMobil Is Increasingly Being Singled Out for Its Role in Climate Change Deceit Matthew Sweeney, a spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees New York's pension fund, said there was broad support among investors. ""Companies that fail to address global warming, and the worldwide effort to curb it, put their bottom line at risk,"" he said. Yngve Slyngstad, NBIM's chief executive officer, told a Norwegian parliamentary committee on Friday that the bank has worked to address climate change since 2006. The fund, he said, has sought to divest from companies that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation and to measure the carbon footprint of its investment portfolio. Norway's fund is among a growing number of entities taking aim at ExxonMobil. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have come out in support of a US congressional push for the Department of Justice to investigate the company for potentially misleading the public about when — and what — it new about global warming. The attorneys general for California and New York, as well as those in more than a dozen other states, are also looking into potential fraud. The Rockefeller Family Fund announced in March that it would divest its holdings in the fossil fuel industry, including Exxon. And in April, Standard & Poor's downgraded Exxon's credit rating for the first time since the Great Depression. Slyngstad has declined to speculate publicly on how Exxon and Chevron shareholders will vote later this month. But even if the resolutions fail, Norway's support of them indicates that corporations will increasingly be called upon to incorporate climate change in their business plans, said Robert Brulle, a professor of sociology and environmental science at Drexel University. Brulle said he was glad Norway and other ""progressive"" stockholders are trying to force corporations like ExxonMobil and Chevron to change their practices. And, he said, it's safe to say that pressure will keep coming. ""This is just common sense,"" he said. ""All companies usually try to take into account changing factors that are going on around them. Not taking into account climate change is almost willful ignorance on the part of corporations.""

689,689,23-05-17 11:00,2017,5,23,Meaghan Beatley,When Death Becomes Social Media Spectacle," Facebook's moderation guidelines—the infamous Facebook Files leaked this weekend by  The Guardian—have journalists, media ethics scholars, mental health experts and most breathing organisms scratching their heads over the dubious nature of many of the social media platform's policies regulating issues such as pornography, racism and terrorism. Chief among the controversial guidelines set forth by the leaked internal manual is one that allows users to livestream suicides and other attempts at self harm.  According to the documents, Facebook ""doesn't want to censor or punish people in distress who are attempting suicide"" and hopes that by leaving such content up for a certain period of time, other users may be able to intervene.  However, many media professionals are concerned by what they see as a hasty and misguided approach.  ""Facebook has no obligation to give a platform to someone who wants to kill themself any more than the keepers of the Golden Gate Bridge have no obligation to make it easier to jump to your death,"" Emmy Award-winning journalist Al Tompkins, currently a senior faculty at the Poynter Institute, told Motherboard.  ""Allowing death to become a social spectacle does nothing to further thoughtful conversation about suicide or to point to alternative solutions to life problems,"" he said.  On his end, Aidan White, director of the Ethical Journalism Network, called Facebook's policy ""utterly self serving.""  ""People who are disturbed and self-harming need support and help, and promoting their distress helps no one,"" he told Motherboard. ""Facebook are besotted by a business model that makes no distinction between the quality of information or the nature of the content that is uploaded.""  Earlier this month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the social media giant would be adding 3,000 people to a moderation task force in charge of regulating sensitive content. The decision was largely fueled by outrage over a series of viral videos showcasing users harming themselves or others.  Susan McGregor, assistant director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, told Motherboard the diffusion of violent content, including self harm footage, is nothing new to the media industry. Images of immolating Buddhist monks were mass distributed in the '60s, for example. But social media platforms don't enjoy the same help and training, developed over decades, that traditional media does, McGregor says.   ""All of a sudden these Facebook moderators, who have a couple of weeks of training and who are supposed to spend most of their time reviewing a lot of very disturbing content, have to make judgment calls about [content] and there's no indication they have the training or expertise to do so or the support to deal with it,"" she said.  Ultimately, McGregor says it will be a matter of time before we see how livestreaming self harm impacts users.  ""The only way to go about this responsibly is to go slowly and make sure you understand what the ramifications of these new possibilities may be,"" she says.  ""But no one in the tech world wants to hear, 'Go slowly.'""

Stu has thick black hair and smiles warmly as he stands in the lineup. On the other side of the mirror are several women, average but pleasant-looking, like the men. They are each asked by a host which of the men they would want to date. The contest is rigged to give Stu a perceived leg up on the other men: Stu, they are told, is highly successful, a millionaire. But no one picks him. When asked why, all the women point to his height as the reason. What would it take for Stu to win the lineup, the host asks? ""Maybe the only thing you could say is maybe the other four are murders,"" one of the women says quietly, arms crossed.  The idea that height is important for finding love and earning money, to succeeding in life and being taken seriously, has been hammered into many of us since we were kids. Arbitrary height requirements show up all the time in Western society. Many sperm banks have a robust height requirement for donors of 5'11"", despite an average male height in the US of 5'9"". To become a fashion model, a woman must be at minimum 5'8"", with most models clocking in around 5'10"", when the average American woman is a more modest 5'4"". Much like the experiment above, done for the show 20/20 back in 1996, dating profiles allow anyone searching for a potential mate to create an arbitrary height cut off. Adding fuel to the fire, studies linking height to greater earning potential regularly make headlines. Being short, especially for men, comes with a price, it seems.  Now imagine you are the parent of a short child and your pediatrician tells you that your son or daughter will always be drastically shorter than the other kids and eventually, shorter than the other adults. What if they told you that there was a way to game the system, at least a little, and give your child a couple of extra inches? The long-term health effects of the treatment are not known, and it will require your child to inject themselves regularly. Would you take the gamble?  In 2003, the FDA approved the use of synthetic growth hormone for idiopathic short stature. Before that, growth hormone was only prescribed for children with a demonstrated deficiency, who were not thriving. Since 2003, growth hormone can be prescribed for any child that is simply very short—to be exact, over-two-standard-deviations-below-the-mean short, or about a projected adult height of 5'3"" for a boy and 4'11"" for a girl. Since being short for no medical reason is not a disease, use of synthetic growth hormone for children with idiopathic short stature is not always covered by insurance, so extra height can come at a very high cost, around $52,000 an inch. Because short kids with no growth hormone deficiency are genetically predisposed to be short, synthetic growth hormone can usually only add around one to three inches to their adult height. Some kids don't respond to it at all. Even with the best medicine, you can't completely win a fight with genetics.  That has not stopped parents from asking for treatment for their children. A review of US growth hormone registries in 2012 showed that 18 percent of patients were being treated for idiopathic short stature—for simply being very short. The ability to treat a physical characteristic in children with no underlying pathology has created controversy in the medical community. ""Does a poorly defined, unpredictable benefit suffice to warrant subjecting a healthy child to years of nightly injections with a medication that may carry risk of adverse effects, albeit small? Now factor in the high cost of growth hormone treatment, and the controversy moves from the individual to the societal level,"" says Adda Grimberg, scientific director of the Diagnostic and Research Growth Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and chair of the task force that recently updated physician guidelines for the use of growth hormone treatment.  In the absence of physical health issues, the psychological distress associated with being very short is used as one reason to justify treatment. ""Parents are frequently concerned about the psychological implications of being shorter than average,"" says David Sandberg, director of the Division of Pediatric Psychology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Taller height is used as a proxy for quality of life, he says. But he argues that while short kids may experience bullying, how parents frame that bullying can send an important message to children about height. If a child gets off the school bus crying because someone called him 'shorty,' says Sandberg, and the parent gets very upset, starts crying and vows to speak to the teacher, ""that says to the child that being short is the end of the world,"" he explains. ""Parents need to understand the downside of communicating that something is wrong because of a physical characteristic,"" he adds. The motivation for the bullying may not be a child's height, explains Sandberg, and the bully simply uses height as an easy way to insult the child.  It is difficult to tease out how often the decision to seek treatment is motivated by distress experienced by a child or by parental concerns. ""We are not privy to the conversations in the home before a family decides to seek medical care,"" Grimberg says. ""Even observations at the clinic visit are ambiguous. Commonly, the children say they're cool with their height, they have friends, etc, but then their parents will jump in to remind them of that time they complained they couldn't go on the amusement park ride or were teased in school. It's hard to tease out if the child is too shy to bring up their concerns at the doctor's office or if the parents are pushing them to get treatment.""  Most of us will never be models for many reasons and don't have any interest in becoming sperm donors. While childhood bullies may target smaller kids who are less physically intimidating, emotional and social outcomes for shorter kids are no different from those for their average-height peers. In a hypothetical world where we could all be in the top quartiles for height, another arbitrary physical characteristic would simply replace height for bullies and picky daters. As for the studies correlating height and earning potential, subsequent studies have found cognitive ability to be the mediating factor predicting success. Discrepancies in maternal and childhood health and nutrition impact both cognitive abilities and adult height.  Whether or not Stu from 20/20 ever found dating success is a question lost to time, but other markedly short men who are over two standard deviations from the norm have fared well, including 4'11"" former Secretary of Labor under the Clinton administration, Robert Reich, whose wife was 9"" taller. Or take beloved 4'10' or 5' (depending on who you ask) actor Danny DeVito, who has been married for over forty years, or the 5'2"" tall ladies' man Prince. All three fall under the height guidelines that would make them eligible for treatment for idiopathic short stature. Being 4'11"" never stopped Veronica Lake from being a sex symbol in the 1940s, or Lil'Kim from being a rap revolutionary, though it too would have made both of them eligible for growth hormone.  Society may continue to favor taller height, especially for men, but that does not mean short stature should be pathologized. While there is discretion for doctors when to suggest treatment, Grimberg recommends it in cases where an underlying growth problem is suspected but ""diagnostic tests are unable to capture that problem."" For physicians, abnormal growth patterns imply health issues, while height is a variable physical characteristic. When two short parents bring in a healthy, well-adjusted short child on the other hand, ""my job is not to treat someone who is fine with themselves just because the FDA picked a line on the growth chart.""

691,691,20-03-17 18:20,2017,3,20,Sarah Wildman,India's prime minister just selected an anti-Muslim firebrand to lead its largest state,"The head of the world’s biggest democracy just appointed to a top government post a person who once publicly supported killing Muslims. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday appointed Yogi Adityanath, a five-term member of India’s parliament who’s been called the “hate spewing ‘yogi,’” as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state. Uttar Pradesh is home to 220 million people — one-fifth of whom are Muslim. Three years ago, communal violence in Uttar Pradesh killed more than 60 people. In recent years, Adityanath has faced criminal charges of attempted murder, defiling a place of worship, and inciting riots in Uttar Pradesh — the state he has now been tasked with running. Adityanath is a hard-line advocate of Hindutva — an ideology that advocates for Hindu hegemony over India. Always photographed in saffron robes, his head shaved, Adityanath is known for his devout Hinduism (he is a Hindu priest) and avid practice of yoga — and equally well-known for his incitement against Muslims. He publicly supported President Donald Trump’s ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations, stating, “Similar action is needed to contain terror activities in this country.” In 2015, he said, ""If given a chance, we will install statues of Goddess Gauri, Ganesh and Nandi” — Hindu deities — “in every mosque."" He also once said, “If one Hindu girl marries a Muslim man, then we will take 100 Muslim girls in return … If they [Muslims] kill one Hindu man, then we will kill 100 Muslim men.” ""Adityanath has been one of Uttar Pradesh's most polarising politicians, given to hateful rhetoric that incites discrimination and hostility against minority groups, particularly Muslims,” Aakar Patel, executive director of Amnesty International India, said in a statement. Adityanath’s deputy, Keshav Prasad Maurya, told the Indian Express newspaper that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh “have no reason to worry.” “We consider all of UP population as one and we don’t distinguish it as Hindu and Muslim,” Maurya said. But that statement, as Time magazine writer Nikhil Kumar notes, runs directly against Adityanath’s public statements over the past decade. In 2005, Kumar notes, the new minister of Uttar Pradesh said he would “not stop” until he turned Uttar Pradesh “and India into a Hindu rastra (nation).” Adityanath’s words are particularly dangerous in a region known for communal violence. A Hindustan Times report on riots in the region noted most violence there began with “mundane arguments that turn violent.” Indeed, the newspaper Indian Express called the selection of Adityanath a “tragic letdown.” “The BJP’s fig leaf was that hate talk was a speech bubble of the marginal and the fringe. That fringe is now in charge of India’s most populous and politically crucial state.” Adityanath was sworn in promising to uphold Modi’s idea of development for all. His fellow politicians remain dubious that a man known for divisiveness can serve all the people in his populous state. Manish Tewari, a former information and broadcast minister of India, tweeted it was a “harbinger to greater polarization.”",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/3/20/14982146/modi-india-muslim-yogi-adityanath-incitement,,Vox
692,692,06-12-17 21:30,2017,12,6,Louise Matsakis,"This Entrepreneur Is Growing Organic Leather Without the Cows
"," If you visit the Modern Museum of Art (MoMa) in New York City this winter, you’ll see a unique graphic t-shirt on display at the new Is Fashion Modern? exhibit. It’s not made from cotton, or a synthetic fabric like polyester. The material, dubbed Zoa, is “biofabricated,” and meant to resemble something like leather. Developed by a company called Modern Meadow, the t-shirt is derived from organic materials, but doesn’t utilize skin from cows or any other animal.   “Leather is one of our most ancient and beautiful materials, we love it. But we believe there’s a whole realm of innovation to be explored,” Andras Forgacs, the founder and CEO of Modern Meadow, told me on a phone call. “And to do it in a way that’s sustainable, that doesn’t harm animals.”  Modern Meadow is aiming to radically alter the leather economy, which has an estimated global trade value of around $100 billion per year. Forgacs and his team want to replace one of humankind’s most ancient materials with something not only new, but also sustainable. Leather is ultimately a byproduct of the food industry, but if people begin widely eating so-called clean meat, it might become more scarce.  “We’re on the cusp of biology and technology coming together to build a whole new engine of innovation for everything,” Forgacs said. “We have natural materials and we have synthetic materials. There’s going to be a third category made from the same building blocks of nature.”  Forgacs called me at the start of a busy day in December. That night, he was headed to London for the Business of Fashion’s annual VOICES conference, where he was going to present about Zoa and what we might wear in the future.  “I’m hardly one to speak about fashion as an authority,” Forgacs said when I asked about the conference. I pointed out that it must be hard to build a company focused on sustainability in a business known for excess and extravagance. He mostly shrugged the idea off. “Fashion is an incredibly self-conscious industry,” he argued. As consumers grow more conscious about what they wear, the industry will change with them, he said.  Forgacs and his company are ultimately betting that fashion brands and their customers will want to wear clothes made from biofabricated materials like Zoa. Last year, Modern Meadow convinced investors that the idea was viable. It raised $40 million, bringing the company’s total funding to over $50 million. Now, it’s full speed ahead. The goal next year is to debut several pieces of clothing developed in collaboration with different fashion brands.  Forgacs doesn’t have a scientific background, but he has been working in the field for over a decade. After stints in finance and consulting, he and his father, Gabor Forgacs—an accomplished scientist— launched Organovo in 2007. Now a publicly-traded company, Organovo grows real human tissue in the lab for medical and pharmaceutical research.  “A lot of conversations began to come up about where we could take this technology,” Forgacs said. “Like If you could make skin, could you make leather? I was really intrigued by this idea: Could we take biofabrication beyond medicine?”  To grow Zoa, Forgacs’ team begins with a strain of yeast that’s genetically engineered to produce a protein identical to that of cattle collagen—the protein found in cow’s skin. Collagen is the main structuctural protein in all animals; it’s what makes skin strong and elastic. Modern Meadow isn’t the first company to utilize genetic engineering to create a luxury good. Similar techniques have been used to create new varieties of materials like silk, for example  “The way we make our collagen is we brew it. We developed a type of yeast that eats sugar and produces collagen,” Forgacs told me. The company’s lab “looks very much like a brewery.” Modern Meadow’s chief creative officer Suzanne Lee has experimented with making clothes from kombucha in the past.   What’s ultimately created is a customizable sheet of raw “leather,” that can be dyed, tanned, and finished in any way a designer pleases. Zoa comes out polished; free from the blemishes characteristic of cowhide. In the future, designers could even tinker with the genetic properties of Zoa, in order to optimize for one feature over another, like thinness or sturdiness.   Forgacs stressed to me that Zoa ultimately isn’t intended to try and imitate leather; it’s meant to be a new material entirely. But it certainly  reminds you of the material.   “Some of the most exciting innovation is not when it’s about imitating the past,” Forgacs said. “It’s when it’s familiar enough that I understand where it came from, but then it’s also provoking me with something new.”   Humans of the Year is a series about the people building a better future for everyone.

Shuttered government agencies are set to reopen for the next three weeks as Congress hammers out a broader border security deal, which may or may not include wall funding.

""As Democrats have said all along, the solution to this impasse was separate funding for the government and then go over our disagreements on border security,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a Friday press conference where he agreed to Trump’s three-week proposal. This shutdown was notable for being the longest in modern American history but now also for how little it achieved. Past shutdowns have been over fights on deficits, spending, abortion, and — most recently — Obamacare. Here’s what they accomplished:   President: Barack Obama  President Trump threw up his hands on the 35-day partial government shutdown Friday, giving Democrats exactly what they wanted and pointedly not getting what he shut the government down for in the first place: $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. Shuttered government agencies are set to reopen for the next three weeks as Congress hammers out a broader border security deal, which may or may not include wall funding. If the president doesn’t like the deal he’s offered on Feb. 15, he can shut the government down again.  ""As Democrats have said all along, the solution to this impasse was separate funding for the government and then go over our disagreements on border security,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a Friday press conference where he agreed to Trump’s three-week proposal. This shutdown was notable for being the longest in modern American history but now also for how little it achieved. Past shutdowns have been over fights on deficits, spending, abortion, and — most recently — Obamacare. Here’s what they accomplished:   President: Barack Obama   Duration: Oct. 1 to Oct. 17: 16 days. Reason: Obamacare A Republican-controlled House was attempting to disrupt the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010. So, amid budget negotiations, tea party factions tacked provisions onto spending bills that would’ve either depleted the healthcare law of any funding or delayed the law’s full implementation. The Senate, which was controlled by Democrats, refused to pass those bills, triggering a shutdown that lasted for 16 days. Unlike Trump, Obama was ready to pass a spending bill agreed upon by Congress, so long as it didn’t come with any strings attached regarding the existing healthcare program. (Republicans had already failed to repeal the law or sue it out of existence.) But, he was up against an incredibly persistent freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, who read “Green Eggs and Ham” during a 21-hour Senate filibuster on how much he hated the healthcare law.  What they said: “We’ve been locked in a fight over here, trying to bring government down to size, trying to do our best to stop Obamacare. We fought the good fight. We just didn’t win,” then-House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, told a Cincinnati radio station when the shutdown ended.  What it accomplished: The GOP’s popularity suffered during the shutdown, so then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell caved and passed the spending bill Obama and Democrats asked for in the first place. Republicans continued to attack Obamacare, though, and have since tried to get rid of the law through more repeals and lawsuits.   President: Bill Clinton  Duration: Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996: 21 days  Reason: The deficit At 21 days, the second government shutdown under Bill Clinton was — at the time — the longest shutdown in U.S. government history. The feud between Republicans and Clinton was over balancing the federal budget, with Clinton saying Congressional Budget Office forecasts were too pessimistic. Clinton had resolved an earlier shutdown by agreeing to balance the budget in seven years. The president eventually proposed a CBO-approved plan to balance the budget, and the government reopened. About 284,000 workers were temporarily furloughed.  What they said: House Speaker Newt Gingrich acknowledged his actions during the shutdown were at least partially motivated by a personal slight after he was seated near the back of Air Force One. “This is petty,” he said. “You’ve been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you, and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp … You just wonder, Where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?”  What it accomplished: The incident is largely viewed as having damaged Newt Gingrich’s reputation as speaker of the House, with critics accusing him of fighting for a government shutdown over a personal vendetta against Clinton. The New York Daily News, for example, published a cartoon that depicted Gingrich as a baby throwing a tantrum.  President: Bill Clinton Duration: Nov. 13 to Nov. 19: 6 days  Reasons: Medicare, environmental regulations, and the budget The GOP-controlled Congress sent a spending bill to President Clinton’s desk that included increased Medicare premiums and cuts to environmental regulations, according to Vox. The bill, which Clinton vetoed, also stipulated that the budget had to be balanced in seven years. After five days, an agreement was reached to reopen the government and continue negotiations. Clinton agreed to the requirement of balancing the budget in the coming years. This shutdown resulted in 800,000 workers being furloughed.   What they said: Clinton said Republicans “failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to keep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment.”  What it accomplished: Clinton agreed to a timeline for balancing the budget but the standoff largely hurt Republicans politically, with a Gallup poll saying 46 percent of people blamed the GOP for the shutdown while just 27 percent blamed Clinton.  President: Jimmy Carter  Duration: Sept. 30 to Oct. 12: 11 days  Reasons: Abortion, raises for government workers Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. But they disagreed on a pay raise for government workers and whether federal funds could be spent on some abortion services. The House was on the side of raising pay for certain civil servants by 5.5 percent and curtailing federal dollars for abortion in almost all circumstances. The Senate disagreed with the pay raise, and wanted to keep federal funding for abortions in cases where the pregnant woman had been raped, subject to incest, or had a dangerous health condition during pregnancy.  Eventually, the two chambers agreed to keep the pay raises and also allow abortion funding in cases of rape, incest, or certain death — but not dangerous health conditions.   What they said: Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker, a Republican from Tennessee, was against the pay increases for civil servants: “I'm against a pay increase, but I don't want to see the Government grind to a halt.”  What it accomplished: The Senate succeeded in keeping government funding for abortions in extreme circumstances, maintaining the option for sick and abused low-income women.   President: Jimmy Carter  Duration: Sept. 30 to Oct. 18: 18 days  Reasons: “Wasteful” government spending and abortion Jimmy Carter prevailed in an 18-day shutdown after he vetoed a defense spending bill that included money for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Carter also vetoed a public works appropriations bill because he wasn’t a fan of water projects that he deemed wasteful government spending. But that’s not all: There was also a feud over funding for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (which later split into the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education) because Congress still couldn’t agree on whether and how Medicaid should cover abortion care.  What they said: “I am going to be very persistent in my own role as president in holding down unwarranted spending in individual bills that come to me from the Congress,” President Carter said days before he vetoed the bills.  What it accomplished: Carter pretty much won this fight, with defense spending and public works spending bills passed without the two provisions to which he objected. Congress again agreed on the abortion funding.  President: Jimmy Carter  Duration: Nov. 30 to Dec. 9: 8 days Oct. 31 to Nov. 9: 8 days Sept. 30 to Oct. 13: 12 days  Reason: Abortion The government went into a shutdown three separate times in 1977, all because Congress (controlled by Democrats) couldn’t agree on abortion. The Senate wanted Medicaid funding for abortions resulting from cases of rape, incest, and if the mother’s health was in danger. At the time, that money was only available if the mother’s life was in peril. On Oct. 13, Congress temporarily postponed the debate and reopened the government until Oct. 31. An agreement wasn’t reached, so it closed again until Nov. 9 when the government was once again temporarily reopened until Nov. 30. The final shutdown lasted until Dec. 9 when Congress came to an agreement.  What they said: Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, Democrat from West Virginia, publicly worried that the Senate would be blamed for the shutdown.   What it accomplished: The funding was extended for cases of rape, incest, and danger to health, although Ronald Reagan later rolled these provisions back.   President: Gerald Ford   Duration: Sept. 30 to Oct. 11: 10 days  Reason: The president vetoed a spending bill he thought was bloated  A Democrat-controlled Congress sent a spending bill up to President Ford, which he vetoed because he thought it allocated too much money to the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare. Congress quickly overruled that veto, but the shutdown still created a funding gap that wasn’t resolved until Congress passed another resolution to fund the rest of the government on Oct. 11.   What they said: “The partisan political purpose of this bill is patently clear,” Ford said after he refused to pass the first spending bill.   What it accomplished: This was the first shutdown since the government revised its budget-making process, and politicians figured out how to use government shutdowns for political purposes. (It wasn’t until 1980 that the government had to totally cease operations during a shutdown, though, so the political fallout wasn’t as great and it was more of a funding lapse than an actual shutdown.) Also, Democrats got the money they wanted.

695,695,27-11-17 20:29,2017,11,27,Tony Romm,Uber is going to have to explain to Congress why it hid the 2016 data breach that affected 57 million users,"Uber is facing fresh questions from the U.S. Congress after it initially suppressed details about a data breach that affected more than 57 million of its drivers and riders in 2016. In a series of letters sent to the ride-hailing company on Monday, Democrats and Republicans alike pressed Uber to detail why it hadn’t informed customers sooner, whether it has spoken with law enforcement agencies about the matter and what exactly it’s doing to help drivers whose sensitive data was stolen. To all of the lawmakers that wrote Uber, though, the incident also amounted to just the latest misstep by a tech giant that’s repeatedly faced a litany of government probes for its controversial business practices. It’s not just that the company “concealed the breach without notifying affected drivers and consumers,” began a group of four Republicans, led by Sen. John Thune, in their note to the company Monday. It’s that “prior privacy concerns at Uber” make it “a serious incident that merits further scrutiny.” Asked about the letter, an Uber spokesman said the company has “been in contact with members of Congress and the relevant committees to inform them of the situation,” adding: “We are working to respond to their inquiries and address their concerns."" The barrage of criticism Monday came days after Uber revealed that the company — at the time under the leadership of Travis Kalanick — fell victim to a major security breach in 2016 and paid the hackers a $100,000 ransom to transfer the stolen data back. The information taken included names, phone numbers, email addresses, and in the case of 600,000 of its drivers, their license data, too. In sharing those findings last week — perhaps hoping to do so under the cover of the Thanksgiving holiday — new Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the company’s chief security officer had been fired. Uber also added new security aides to help it further investigate the breach. Still, Khosrowshahi’s apology hasn’t satisfied federal regulators, including Thune and three other Senate Republicans, who lead key committees that oversee tech, telecom, finance and data security. In their letter, sent Monday, the lawmakers demanded that Uber detail a full timeline as to what it discovered about the breach, as well as which state and federal law enforcement or regulatory agencies the company informed about the incident. They also asked Uber to assure that riders’ and drivers’ other critical, sensitive information had not been stolen. Among lawmakers’ additional concerns: Federal officials use Uber, so Senate Republicans are trying to “identify and mitigate potential consumer harm and identity-theft-related fraud against federal programs,” they wrote. Uber’s replies could carry serious political and legal repercussions. Forty-eight states have laws on their books that require companies to inform consumers promptly whenever their information has been stolen — and in many cases, the theft of Uber drivers’ license numbers would have required the ride-hailing company to make the breach public. To that end, at least five states’ attorneys general are investigating Uber on related grounds, Recode first reported last week. Meanwhile, the four Republicans asked Uber if it had disclosed details of the breach to the Federal Trade Commission. The agency had been investigating Uber at the time of the incident in 2016 for another, unrelated privacy and security mishap. If Uber did not inform the FTC, it could face additional penalties. Echoing some of those same concerns was Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who sent his own letter to Uber on Monday. In asking for more information about why it hadn’t disclosed the breach sooner, he also pressed Uber to explain why it didn’t have a more secure system to handle payments. Warner further demanded that Uber share how it managed to find the hackers in the first place. While he acknowledged that the company could have discovered the criminals using forensics, Warner said that Uber’s “past pattern of conduct” still causes him to wonder if the ride-hailing app essentially tried to “hack back” its hackers. That’s illegal under federal law, Warner reminded. Once Uber found the hackers, though, it paid them a $100,000 ransom and required them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. To Warner, that “thwarts law enforcement’s ability to bring criminal hackers to justice.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2017/11/27/16706400/congress-democrats-republicans-uber-2016-data-breach,,Vox
696,696,02-10-18 00:00,2018,10,2,,Donald Trump Mocks Christine Blasey Ford at Rally in Mississippi,"Donald Trump was bitching about due process Tuesday, but just hours later made a mockery of his FBI investigation by essentially calling Dr. Christine Blasey Ford a fraud. POTUS mocked Dr. Ford at a rally in Mississippi Tuesday night, before intimating she belongs to a group of ""really evil people"" set out to destroy other people's lives ... like Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Trump was egged on by his Mississippi supporters, as he repeatedly made fun of Ford's testimony about being sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh ... specifically her claim that she only had one beer at the party where it allegedly took place.

The pro wrestling company signed a deal with Facebook to stream a new “single-elimination mixed tag-team tournament” directly on the social network. That means WWE will feature tag-team matches — one male and one female wrestler per team — for 12 straight weeks. These are not the highly touted pay-per-view matches that WWE is known for, but the company is still rolling out some well-known wrestlers, like Jimmy Uso and Natalya. (Uso has more than four million Facebook followers, for example.) Facebook is paying WWE for a dozen 20-minute episodes, but a company spokesperson declined to share financial terms of the deal. As with the other professional content Facebook has acquired, these WWE matches will exist inside Facebook Watch, the company’s new video tab. Facebook has been paying publishers to create exclusive shows for the service, and has also been paying for streaming rights for sporting events, like college basketball games. The hope is that Facebook becomes a video destination, not just a place people stumble across video while looking at their friends’ vacation photos. The WWE deal is interesting for a few reasons, though: The first episode is set to air on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018.

The request came as the government plans to halt a scheme that allows rich foreigners to buy citizenship with a minimum 1-million-lev ($582,000) investment, on grounds it had failed to bring any significant economic benefit to the EU country.  The European Union’s executive commission is concerned that such schemes could help foreign organised crime groups infiltrate the 28-member bloc. Bulgaria is ranked as the EU state most prone to corruption and organised crime.  Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said Sergey Druzhinin, a Russian, and Kazakh Kahir Rahimov, who obtained Bulgarian passports in 2011, had concealed information that would have ruled them out for Bulgarian citizenship.  Two other Russians, Vladislav Levitskiy and Galina Ulyutina, had not fulfilled a requirement for investment by foreigners within a two-year period, Tsatsarov said in a statement.  Ulyutina is the wife of Yuri Soloviev, First Deputy Chairman of VTB Bank, one of Russia’s largest state-owned banks.  “The prosecutor’s office received indications from the national security agency that violations were committed during the procedure for acquisition of citizenship as well as for non-fulfillment of obligations ...(for) investment,” he said.  None of the three Russians and the Kazakh named by Tsatsarov could be reached for comment.  Tsatsarov sent his request to the Justice Ministry which is expected to forward it to Bulgaria’s president for a final ruling.  Tsatsarov’s office said other cases of violations of the citizenship law uncovered by the security agency were under investigation.

701,701,05-05-16 14:10,2016,5,5,Matthew Yglesias,Add Puerto Rico's debt crisis to the list of issues Donald Trump doesn't understand,"Now that Donald Trump has secured his place as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, the fact that his statements on matters of public policy often don't make sense will be taken much more seriously. The latest example came during yesterday's interview between Trump and CNN's Wolf Blitzer in which, among other things, Blitzer asked Trump about Puerto Rico. You can read our explainer on the Puerto Rico situation here, but the long and short of it is that Puerto Rico owes a ton of money and, due to population loss, it can't pay. Under normal circumstances, a city or county or business in this situation would file for bankruptcy to reduce its debt burden, but the existing bankruptcy code doesn't let Puerto Rico do this. The White House and many congressional Democrats have proposed creating a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico, but Republicans — at the behest of distressed debt funds that bought up Puerto Rican bonds — have blocked it. Here's Blitzer trying to ask Trump if he agrees the bankruptcy law should change: WOLF BLITZER: They're prevented from using the bankruptcy laws, Puerto Rico, as opposed to all the US states. You've used those bankruptcy laws over the years. DONALD TRUMP: I'm the king — I understand. By the way — WOLF BLITZER: Should Puerto Rico have an opportunity to use the bankruptcy laws? DONALD TRUMP: As a very successful person I would buy companies, throw them in a chapter, bankrupt it, negotiate — I would do great deals, I didn't use them for myself, I used them as a businessperson. Many of the top people in my category use the laws. I know more about debt than practically anybody, I love debt. I also love reducing debt, and I know how to do it better than anybody. I will tell you with Puerto Rico they have too much debt. You can't just restructure; you have to use the laws, cut the debt way down, and get back to business, because they can't survive with the kind of debt they have. I would not bail out if I were — if I were in that position I wouldn't bail them out. WOLF BLITZER: Would you let them have a bankruptcy option? DONALD TRUMP: They're going to have no choice. if they're not going to pay the bill they're not going to pay the interest on the bonds — WOLF BLITZER: They can't. DONALD TRUMP: They can't. You can't — you know, the expression you can't take it out of the grave if they don't have it. Whether they officially declare or not, but ultimately what they have to do is cut the debt way down. They're never going to pay that debt off, they have to cut it way down, and the United States is going to be in that position very soon because they have too much debt. Trump is so busy here being defensive about his business record that he's not understanding what the question is. He seems to think that Puerto Rico legally can file for bankruptcy and the problem is they haven't done so, and that what they need is a smarter leader/negotiator at the helm who can clean up the balance sheet the way he would have in one of his real estate deals. But the whole political issue is that a) Puerto Rico can't do this, legally speaking, and b) the political party that Trump leads is blocking the Obama administration from changing the law. But Trump has no idea what's going on and doesn't seem to be listening to Blitzer's questions. It's easy to go numb to these kinds of things, roll your eyes at pedantic coverage, and say Trump's success so far shows voters don't care about small details like whether or not the president has any idea what he's talking about. But the fact of the matter is that very few people vote in primaries at all, and lots of people don't pay much attention to early campaign coverage. The fact that Trump repeatedly shows up to interviews totally unprepared to discuss the issues of the day in an informed manner and proceeds to wing it in an inconsistent and ideologically unpredictable way is important, and people need to keep hearing about it.",https://www.vox.com/2016/5/5/11595610/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-trump,,Vox

S-Oil said in a statement on Wednesday that the cost of the proposed project in the southeast of South Korea was estimated at $6 billion, up from the $4.3 billion it had previously expected.  The MOU coincides with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to South Korea this week as the two countries seek to bolster economic ties.  Saudi Aramco said in a separate statement on Wednesday that it had signed 12 pacts with South Korean partners worth billions of dollars.  S-Oil said it hoped to complete the plant by 2024 as part of a drive to expand its petrochemical business.  The South Korean refiner said it was looking to build a so-called steam cracker with a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum and olefin downstream facilities in the plant.  The cracker would produce ethylene and other basic petrochemical products, while the olefin downstream facilities would churn out high-value petrochemical products including polyethylene.  S-Oil said last August that it was conducting a feasibility study into building the cracker and olefin downstream facilities.  Separately, S-Oil last year finished building two other petrochemical plants in South Korea. They began operating in November, producing 405,000 tonnes per year of polypropylene, 300,000 tonnes per year of propylene oxide, and 21,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline.

704,704,20-05-19 00:00,2019,5,20,Idrees Ali,U.S. warship sails in disputed South China Sea amid trade tensions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said one of its warships sailed near the disputed Scarborough Shoal claimed by China in the South China Sea on Sunday, angering Beijing at a time of tense ties between the world’s two biggest economies.  The busy waterway is one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which include a trade war, U.S. sanctions and Taiwan.  China struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the United States on Friday.   The tough talk capped a week that saw China unveil new retaliatory tariffs in response to a U.S. decision to raise its levies on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.  The U.S. destroyer Preble carried out the operation, a U.S. military spokesman told Reuters.  “Preble sailed within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Reef in order to challenge excessive maritime claims and preserve access to the waterways as governed by international law,” said Commander Clay Doss, a spokesman for the Seventh Fleet.  Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the ship had entered waters near the shoal without China’s permission, and the Chinese navy had warned it to leave.  “I must stress once again that the U.S. warship’s relevant actions have violated China’s sovereignty and undermined the peace, security and good order in the relevant sea areas. China is firmly opposed to this,” Lu told a daily news briefing.  The United States was trying to disturb regional peace and stability by using the issue of freedom of navigation and flight, he added.  “We strongly urge the United States to immediately stop such provocative actions so as not to undermine Sino-U.S. relations and regional peace and stability.”  It was the second such U.S. military operation in the South China Sea in the last month. On Wednesday, the chief of the U.S. Navy said its freedom of navigation movements in the disputed South China Sea drew more attention than they deserved.  The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including areas claimed by allies, and they are separate from political considerations.  The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate.  China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands.  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims in the region.  China and the United States have repeatedly traded barbs in the past over what Washington says is Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs.  China defends its construction as necessary for self-defense and says the United States is responsible for ratcheting up tension by sending warships and military planes close to islands Beijing claims.  Last month, China’s navy chief said freedom of navigation should not be used to infringe upon the rights of other nations.

Can't really remember when eating dinner became synonymous with 'having a mind-bending holistic experience,' but it was probably around the time people started consuming previously unheard of grains and beans and feeling smug about it. We here at VICE have a penchant for bad-mouthing themed restaurants, and the reasons for that are simple: they're fucking lame, they fucking suck, the people who go to them are shit.  And here we find ourselves again in the grip of a pop-up trying to make us think. The Bunyadi is a naked restaurant that will open somewhere near London Bridge in June, I'm told. You can sit in there on a wooden stool in the buff and have your tea, though you'll be given a gown to cover your disgusting shame if you so wish. The concept comes from a company called Lollipop, who previously masterminded experiences such as 'eating canapés with an owl' and 'the Breaking Bad cocktail bar,' tickets to which would have set you back $45 for two hours (with two free cocktails!).  When asked about the hygiene implications of having everyone's asshole plonked on a tree stump, a representative from Lollipop told me that people would put their gowns ""under their bum.""

When he's not doing all that, he manages to record and release incredible music on the likes of World Unknown, Golf Channel, and Claremont56.

We're bringing you an exclusive listen to both the original and the hefty dub version right here. Oh, and we had a quick chat with Byrne too. Check it all out below. THUMP: Can you tell us a little about how you came to work with Trine Lindegaard?Apiento: I've known Trine for ages since she used to live in London. She said she was working on a new project a while back and needed some music for the show and asked could I help. It was that simple really. She's pretty free with the projects she creates (one day its a mad wall of cross-stitch another time it'll be making something out of African fabrics and weaving) and this one was super interesting as she was working with immigrant ladies with psychological and physical problems in Copenhagen. They have some issues with the far right over there in that there Denmark so a lot of her work is about bringing folk together. So basically, she created a fashion collection around the idea that food brought people together. So I got her to record a load of these people talking about their favorite dish and where they were from etc. From there I wrote the music around it, Alex mixed it... Job done.  And what's your working relationship with LX like?Alex (aka LX) I have known for years. He is actually Alex Tepper from London not another mate of mine, Lexx from Zurich (who I think some people think he is). Alex Tepper is one of the best mix and sound engineers I know. I've got him on the new Mark Barrott stuff at the moment. I've known him for years since when I used to manage producers. I sort of brought his band through when I used to manage Joey Negro, John Ciafone from Mood II Swing and people like that... I realised very early on (just after ""The Orange Place"" which did alright) that what he brought to the table was as important as what I wrote so from there we now co-credit everything. We'll be writing in the studio soon which is always a good time. It's just finding that time to do it. Obviously sleeves are (I assume anyway) incredibly important to you...who're your favorite current designers working in music?Yeah I think sleeves are double important. I sort of bowled out of a project recently over creative differences. In the week I am part of a design studio called Village Green who make lovely branding and 3D work for the likes of Nike so am around design all day long. Sleeve-wise right now I am biased but I'm a fan of Ill Studio who creatively direct all the sleeves for the DEEWEE label I run for 2manydjs. Those sleeves are just ridiculous...It's quietly building into a special record label that one. Hopefully a lot of THUMP readers will also read Test Pressing too. What can we expect from that site over the next few months?Not sure at the minute. We've got a nice recording from the party at Brilliant Corners me and Lexx did the other week. It's the best venue in London for me—good people, food and music—and Lexx played super nice music. Other than that on Test Pressing I just leave Dr Rob to write what he wants when he wants from Japan. He's always up to something so there's always new content to read up there.

710,710,15-05-18 00:00,2018,5,15,"Josh Smith, David Brunnstrom","Safety, verification questions hang over North Korea's plan to close nuclear site","SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shutting down North Korea’s nuclear test site is trickier than it might seem.  A botched tunnel collapse could spread radioactive debris. Nuclear material might be buried, but accessible enough to be dug up and reused in a weapon. And even if all the testing tunnels are destroyed, North Korean engineers could simply dig a new one if they want to conduct another nuclear test.   Disarmament experts have raised many such scenarios after North Korea said over the weekend that it would use explosives to collapse the tunnels of its Punggye-ri nuclear test site next week.  Pyongyang has publicly invited international media to witness the destruction, but not technical inspectors, leaving disarmament experts and nuclear scientists wondering how effective the plan is – and whether it will be safe.  Recent reports indicate that some areas of the Punggye-ri test site have become unstable after the latest and largest nuclear test in September.   More explosions would be unnecessarily risky, but there are steps North Korea could take to make the shutdown more credible and safe, said Suh Kune-yull, professor of nuclear energy systems engineering at Seoul National University.  “Blowing up isn’t the most ideal way,” Suh said. “It might be less dramatic than an explosion, but filling the tunnel up with concrete, or sand or gravel would be best.”  There is still a considerable amount of radiation being detected at one of the tunnel complexes where most of North Korea’s nuclear tests have taken place, including the latest test of what North Korea said was a fusion bomb, he said.   But underground nuclear test tunnels and shafts are typically designed to be sealed by the nuclear bomb’s blast wave before radioactive material can escape. Some experts noted that North Korea over the course of its six nuclear tests probably learned how to prevent radiation leaks.      “If it’s done well, there is no risk of radiation being released. But the question is, are these tunnels being sealed in a way that they couldn’t again be used?” said Jon Wolfsthal, the director of the Nuclear Crisis Group and a former senior arms control official at the U.S. National Security Council.  “The only risk I see is that we will take the destruction of a couple of tunnels as a physical barrier to the resumption of testing in the future.”  (GRAPHIC: North Korea's nuclear test site IMG - tmsnrt.rs/2wGynpf)   North Korea’s shutting down its test site could be an effort to mirror other nuclear powers that have ended testing, but hung onto their weapons, analysts say.  Suh said beyond closing tunnels and knocking down buildings, the entire Punggye-ri site will need to be secured to prevent the North Koreans or profiteers from digging up nuclear material that could be reused in weapons or sold on the black market.   Previous efforts to close underground nuclear test sites have sometimes been messy, drawn-out affairs, he said.      In 1999, the United States provided $800,000 to pay for a blast equivalent to 100 tons of dynamite to collapse a tunnel at a former Soviet test site in Kazakhstan.  Known as “Plutonium Mountain,” the Soviet Union’s Semipalatinsk Test Site covered an area roughly the size of Belgium and was the scene of 456 nuclear tests during the Cold War, including at least 340 underground blasts.  Cleaning up and securing that site took 17 years and $150 million, according to a report by Harvard’s Belfer Centre.  France, which performed 13 underground nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert in the 1960s, says it “shut down and dismantled its nuclear test facilities,” and a 2005 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that most of the sites in Algeria show “little residual radioactive material.”  But local people and Algeria’s government said the tests - including the 1962 “Beryl Incident” when radioactive rock and dust escaped from an underground nuclear blast - left a legacy of environmental devastation and health problems that last today.   China, Pakistan, India are also known to have conducted underground nuclear tests. South Africa - which dismantled its entire nascent nuclear weapons program in 1989 - closed down its underground shafts without conducting a test.  The United States, meanwhile, detonated at least 828 nuclear bombs underground at its Nevada Test Site.  The site remains open, although no U.S. nuclear tests have been carried out since 1992.  Nuclear experts say the shutdown plan is at least an encouraging political gesture ahead of talks with the United States in June.  But they caution it is not necessarily the first step of the “complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement” of the nuclear program the United States has sought.  The U.S. State Department did not give a specific response when asked whether the United States had asked to send observers to the dismantling of the site or for international monitors to be present.  A spokesman said: “A permanent and irreversible closure that can be inspected and fully accounted for is a key step in the denuclearization of (North Korea). We look forward to learning additional details.”  China - which borders North Korea only about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Punggye-ri - has not publicly said whether it would help dismantle the site or monitor the process.  “To my understanding, the North Korean side has not raised this kind of request to the Chinese side,” a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday.  On Tuesday, the state-backed Global Times ran an editorial saying that abandoning the testing site “would bring huge benefits to the region.”  Many doubt North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will ever fully relinquish his expensive and treasured nuclear weapons, but even if he curtails his program, analysts warn it will be a long process.  “I am concerned that Kim Jong Un may take unilateral actions that are hard to dispute - like closing the test site - and implement them without any observation,” said Sharon Squassoni, a research professor at the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy in Washington. “This would set up a complicated situation wherein North Korea was taking actions that we would normally applaud, but without any verification.”  Additional reporting by Christine Kim in SEOUL, Matt Spetalnick in WASHINGTON, and Christian Shepherd in BEIJING; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Gerry Doyle",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-nuclearsite/safety-verification-questions-hang-over-north-koreas-plan-to-close-nuclear-site-idUSKCN1IG0T5,World News,Reuters
711,711,29-08-18 12:01,2018,8,29,Dylan Scott,Florida primary: Andrew Gillum wins Dem governor nod,"Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum prevailed in the hotly contested Democratic primary election for Florida governor, giving the left another marquee win in the 2018 midterms. Gillum is the first black Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida history. He won out over Gwen Graham, a former member of Congress, the daughter of a former governor and senator, and the presumed Democratic frontrunner; former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine; and businessman Jeff Greene. He will face Republican Ron DeSantis in November’s general election, a race that election forecasters have rated a toss-up. The state capital’s mayor since 2014, Gillum is young at 39, black (he would also be Florida’s first black governor), and pretty far to the left ideologically. He received the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Our Revolution, and Democracy for America in the primary. He has proposed hiking the state’s corporate tax rate to fund education, raising its minimum wage to $15, and he endorsed a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system at the national level. Gillum also supports expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, which Florida has thus far refused to do, leaving hundreds of thousands of its poorest residents without coverage. He has also joined with other progressive leaders who want to abolish the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency after the family separations crisis. There is also, however, an ongoing FBI investigation into corruption in the Tallahassee city government — though Gillum has not been implicated in any way, according to the Tampa Bay Times. DeSantis, currently a member of the US House, has done everything he can to embrace Donald Trump, complete with a campaign ad in which he builds a wall with his daughter and puts his young son in a Make America Great Again onesie. Gillum had led in no independent polls before Tuesday’s primary, so his win is a genuine surprise. But political operatives in the state had picked up a sense of momentum for his campaign, and the last St. Pete Polls survey before the election found him trailing Graham by just 7 points. State politicos thought Gillum benefited from being the odd man out in what was at times a fierce battle between Graham and Greene in particular. Graham, who served one term in the US House and had the endorsement of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), had led in almost every public poll. “Gillum is definitely rising,” Steve Schale, a Democratic operative in the state, told me before the primary. “When you have four people in the race, typically the one who is rising at the end is the one not being attacked.” Progressives have made inroads in Democratic primaries, but they’ve also lost plenty of races like the Florida governor’s race where there was an establishment alternative. Gillum stands out as the of the left’s biggest wins in 2018. Now he’s on to the general election.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/28/17793198/florida-primary-results-andrew-gillum-governor,,Vox
712,712,29-03-17 20:50,2017,3,29,Sarah Hagi,Americans Still Don't Think Fathers Deserve Paternity Leave,"When it comes to parental leave, America lags behind most countries. In fact, recent data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development looking at 41 countries found the United States in last place, with a total of zero weeks of federally required paid parental leave. Now, a new study from Pew Research suggests that while Americans generally support parental leave, we're still a nation divided on who we deem deserving—and gender plays a big role in where we fall on the issue. The new report found that about 15 percent of those surveyed believe men shouldn't take paternity leave (whether paid or unpaid), while three percent believe women should not receive any paid maternal leave. Unsurprisingly, these results have less to do with actual facts and more to do with antiquated views on how gender affects caregiving. Fifty-three percent of people surveyed believe that (even discounting the topic of breastfeeding), women do a better job caring for children than men. And while this could be seen as a matter of opinion, researchers concluded, ""Attitudes about gender roles and caregiving are linked, at least in part, to views about the impact of paid leave on men."" They also concluded that more than half of all adults (53 percent) believe American society values the contribution men make at work more than contributions they make at home. These ideas about gender and caregiving also affect support for paid paternity leave. Of those who said that women are naturally better caregivers than men, 61 percent supported paternity leave—a dip from the 78 percent of participants who said men and women are equally-qualified caregivers and support paid paternity leave. Overall, the report concludes that ""majorities of adults express support for paid leave for mothers and fathers after the birth or adoption of their child,"" and nearly all participants agreed that if all Americans had access to paid paternal leave, the impact would be positive for individuals, families, and the economy. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recommends an average paid maternity leave time of just under 20 weeks—but with zero guaranteed weeks of paid paternal leave, America still had a long way to go. And while Trump has been keen to give a nod to the idea of expanding maternity leave, his proposed policy will likely only benefit the rich, leaving many parents in the dark.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xzbg9/americans-still-dont-think-fathers-deserve-paternity-leave,Identity,Vice
713,713,06-02-19 02:30,2019,2,6,Alex Ward,Venezuela: why Trump backs Guaido and protestors want Maduro out,"A long-time dictator and international pariah maintains he won a widely disputed election to stay in power. A fresh-faced, low-profile opposition leader calls him a “usurper” and has incited large-scale protests to hasten his ouster. And the United States — knowing the growing tensions could lead to greater violence — stokes the roaring fire from afar. That’s the situation in Venezuela, where thousands of demonstrators plan to fill the streets on Wednesday in an effort to depose President Nicolás Maduro, the socialist leader who has overseen one of the most devastating economic collapses in the world. The rally is mostly in support of Juan Guaidó, the leader of the country’s opposition-controlled legislative body, who has asked anti-government Venezuelans to demonstrate against Maduro. Guaidó, along with the Trump administration and a number of other international observers, asserts that Maduro isn’t the rightful president of the South American nation. They argue that last May’s presidential election was rigged so that the dictator could win a second six-year term. Citing Venezuela’s constitution, Guaidó and others say the sham vote means that he, as the head of the National Assembly (the country’s legislative body), is the rightful — albeit temporary — leader of the country since there’s no legitimate president. Guaidó wants the military to back him and has called for the people to protest — on the 61st anniversary of when a military dictatorship fell in Venezuela, no less — to compel Maduro’s resignation. Guaidó says he will start to assume the presidential role and that in the future will call for new elections. He doesn’t plan to hold on to the presidency indefinitely, he says. There are good reasons why Guaidó and the anti-Maduro movement have found an audience. Millions have fled the country due to a crippling economic downturn. Inflation is through the roof. Hunger rates have skyrocketed. And diseases once thought eradicated from Venezuela have sparked a new health crisis. Unsurprisingly, all of this and more have made Maduro an unpopular leader. The Trump administration, which often prefers to side with dictators around the world, has taken an unusually strong interest in the power struggle in Venezuela. Senior administration officials including National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have publicly stated that they want to see a new government in Venezuela and that the National Assembly is the country’s only democratically elected body. On January 22, Vice President Mike Pence posted a video on Twitter in which he directly addresses the Venezuelan people. Speaking in English with Spanish subtitles, Pence declared that America offers its “unwavering support ... as you, the people of Venezuela, raise your voices in a call for freedom.” Pence labels Maduro “a dictator with no legitimate claim to power,” calls the National Assembly “the last vestige of democracy” in the country, and says the US supports Guaidó’s “courageous decision” to call for Maduro to be removed from power and replaced by a transitional government. As the good people of Venezuela make your voices heard tomorrow, on behalf of the American people, we say: estamos con ustedes. We are with you. We stand with you, and we will stay with you until Democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of Libertad. pic.twitter.com/ThzIAqBoRn That’s a powerful statement coming from the vice president of the United States. But Trump went one step further: on Wednesday afternoon, Trump himself put out a statement saying he recognizes Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. “In its role as the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people, the National Assembly invoked the country’s constitution to declare Nicolas Maduro illegitimate, and the office of the presidency therefore vacant,” Trump said in a statement sent by the White House. January 23’s demonstration, which has already led to at least four deaths, will represent the strongest pushback yet against Maduro’s unquenchable thirst for power by the citizens and officials he’s subjugated for years. But experts caution that the odds of Maduro maintaining his grip on the country remain in the dictator’s favor, mainly because he still has a strong hold over the country’s major institutions. “It’s most likely that Maduro will remain in power and that Venezuela will continue to worsen — remaining in its miserable, critical condition,” Ronal Rodriguez, an expert at the University of Rosario’s Venezuelan Observatory in Colombia, told me. Protests have broken out throughout the country in recent years, and have picked up against in recent days. And just this week, nearly 30 Venezuelan soldiers supportive of Guaidó’s movement had their mutiny quickly thwarted. Those efforts have added to mounting unrest that in some instances set parts of the capital city of Caracas aflame. But it’s worth pausing briefly to take a look at how the country reached this boiling point. The roots of Wednesday’s demonstrations date back to when Hugo Chávez, the populist firebrand, took over as as president of Venezuela in 1999. He steadily pushed the country away from democracy and spearheaded the country’s experiment with socialism. Chávez is a legendary figure in Venezuela who transformed the country’s political and economic landscape by nationalizing industries and funneling enormous amounts of government money into social programs. Under his rule, Venezuela’s unemployment rate halved, income per capita more than doubled, the poverty rate fell by more than half, education improved, and infant mortality rates declined. And while he sparked ferocious opposition among the country’s elites and conservatives, (and from the United States), the country’s poor and working class loved him. A massive oil boom in the early 2000s that brought roughly a trillion dollars into the country’s coffers — making Venezuela Latin America’s richest country — helped Chávez remain in power until his death in 2013. It also gave him the space to flex his authoritarian muscles. He stacked the country’s courts with political allies, passed laws restricting the ability of journalists to criticize the government, and consistently sought ways to remove checks on his power. However, even Chávez had his limits, and experts say he thought of the electoral system as a key way to make himself more effective as a leader. Maduro, who was Chávez’s vice president and handpicked successor, reveres his former boss and has tried to emulate him ever since Chávez’s demise. The problem is that his attempt to recreate the Chávez era has failed spectacularly and led to a horrific economic, social, and political crisis of his own making. When oil prices crashed in late 2014, Venezuela’s economy crashed with them. Neither Chávez nor Maduro had done anything to diversify the country’s ability to make money, instead relying almost exclusively on oil revenue to fund the state. So when oil prices suddenly took a nosedive, it helped trigger a crisis that saw the nation transform from a regional powerhouse into a failing — if not failed — state in a staggeringly short amount of time. And Maduro has also mismanaged the country’s fiscal policy. As Venezuela expert Francisco Toro wrote for Vox in 2016: Venezuela has been running enormous, unmanageable GDP deficits of more than 10 percent for years, even back when oil prices were high. Needless to say, it didn’t bother to save when the takings were good, and so it now finds itself facing a kind of fiscal Armageddon. The government is so broke it can no longer afford to fly in the planefuls of fast-depreciating bolivar bills (the Venezuelan currency) it gets printed abroad; in effect, the country doesn’t have the money to pay for its money. Inflation now hovers above a million percent, and could reach 10 million percent this year. Food and medicine is too expensive for many to purchase. And since 2015, over 3 million Venezuelans have left the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere, primarily in Colombia. (It’s expected that another 2 million will become refugees in 2019 alone.) As a result, Maduro has become deeply unpopular: His approval ratings have rarely topped 20 percent in recent years. And in December 2015, for the first time in two decades, Venezuelan voters gave opposition parties a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly. The hope was that those lawmakers would check Maduro’s power and perhaps work with him to put the country back on a better economic path. That’s not what happened, though. Instead, Maduro fought back — and kicked off a series of events that led to his current predicament. The dictator and his allies made three stunning moves that demonstrate how much control he aimed to wrest for himself. Venezuelans didn’t just sit back and let this happen without voicing their displeasure, though. They protested furiously in Caracas and throughout the country for years, clashing with Maduro’s security forces in skirmishes that led to hundreds of deaths. Maduro, however, remained in power. He also called an election for early 2018 — a move that might seem positive at first glance, but in reality was a crafty power move intended to cement his authority even further. As Toro explained in the Washington Post at the time, Maduro called for the early election while representatives for his government and the opposition were involved in negotiations — backed by international observers — aimed at hammering out new rules for holding freer and fairer elections. “By announcing an election without an agreement, the regime signaled that this [wasn’t] going to happen,” Toro wrote at the time. And, sure enough, Maduro banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running in the election — all but solidifying his victory. He won with 68 percent of the vote. International organizations and many democratic countries in North and South America and Europe called the vote a sham, as did many Venezuelans. “Jesus Christ could be the candidate and Maduro would still prevail because the system is set up for him to win,” Carlos González, an anti-government activist, told the Guardian right after the vote. That anger remained when Maduro was sworn into office two weeks ago. But it erupted in full force on January 15 when the National Assembly, headed by the 35-year-old Guaidó, called Maduro a “usurper” — stating that he was not the legitimate leader of Venezuela. Guaidó’s ascent is quite surprising, according to Ronal Rodriguez, the Venezuela expert in Colombia. Guaidó is not the most popular figure among the opposition — Rodriguez even said he’s seen as “third-rate” and “uncharismatic.” But pictures of him speaking to large crowds have made the industrial engineer seem like his country’s Barack Obama, Rodriguez explained, although he clearly lacks the former American president’s political skill. But what’s made him so central to the current drama is that he claims he’s the rightful president of his country. Guaidó cites Article 233 of Venezuela’s constitution, which basically says that if the president fails at his or her duties — or if there is an absence in leadership — the National Assembly’s chief will take temporary charge of the nation. Guaidó says he doesn’t have plans to hold onto the office permanently, but rather that he would use his authority to hold a new — and fair — elections while distributing humanitarian aid. Maduro and his supporters, of course, scoff at Guaidó’s claims — both because Maduro won last year’s election, and because the lawmaker’s interpretation of the constitution is somewhat disputed. Guaidó and other opposition politicians have cleverly turned this argument back around on Maduro’s government, using it to rally people to the anti-government cause by arguing the people’s will is what matters most in a democracy. At a January 11 speech in Caracas, Guaidó proclaimed: “Is it enough to lean on the constitution in a dictatorship? No. It needs to be the people, the military and the international community that lead us to take over.” Asumo el deber impuesto por la CRBV y el art. 333 que obliga a todos los venezolanos, investidos o no de autoridad, a luchar para la restitución del orden constitucional #ANRutaPorLaLibertad#CabildoAbierto pic.twitter.com/jBqN7S1hmk But although Guaidó has been able to rally support from everyday Venezuelas, US officials and experts tell me he’s unlikely to get the critical military support he needs to actually force Maduro from power. The vast majority of Venezuela’s armed forces remain fiercely loyal to Maduro, officials and experts say. And on Monday, the military quickly put down an uprising from 27 anti-Maduro national guardsmen who seemingly aimed to foment the president’s ouster. While the small effort failed, it instigated protests near Maduro’s palace where, in one instance, security forces used tear gas on people who set trash on fire for a makeshift barricade. In addition, many of Maduro’s loyalists are still in charge of the country’s most important institutions. As long as the leader still enjoys those safety blankets, he probably won’t cede or lose power. The demonstrations may still have some effect on the country’s future, experts say. “The current protest could represent a new high water mark in terms of challenging both international and domestic perceptions of the government’s legitimacy,” Daniel Erikson, a Latin America adviser in the White House from 2015 to 2017, told me. One country the protesters don’t have to convince of Maduro’s legitimacy deficit, though, is the United States. In August 2017, Trump told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that he was considering a “military option” for Venezuela to overthrow Maduro. His comments, which came seemingly out of the blue, shocked pretty much everyone — not least Maduro’s government. The Trump administration also held secret meetings with rebel Venezuelan officers throughout 2018 in which they discussed plans for a potential coup, according to the New York Times. As of now, though, there is no indication that the US is actively considering militarily intervening in the country — partly because Venezuelan opposition figures and other Latin American leaders have said they’re opposed to such a move. But even a vague threat of that happening, especially when paired with other actions the Trump administration has taken, puts serious pressure on Maduro’s government. Since May 2017, the Trump administration has placed ever-increasing sanctions on the Maduro regime, citing issues like corruption and undemocratic practices. The financial penalties mainly target government officials in Maduro’s inner circle, and even the dictator’s wife. Experts say that while those measures do hurt the government, they also hurt the people of Venezuela, who are already suffering from the crippling economic and health crisis. National Security Adviser John Bolton has said that the squeeze will continue until Maduro changes his ways. In a November 2018 speech that named Venezuela as part of a “troika of tyranny” along with Cuba and Nicaragua, Bolton said Maduro had to release the country’s roughly 340 political prisoners, allow for humanitarian aid to reach those in need, hold free elections, and champion the rule of law and democratic institutions before he could expect any relief. The US even considered labeling Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism. The country does have ties to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah and the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia, but it’s not known to export terrorism purposefully around the world in the same way that, for example, Iran does. Yet despite mounting pressure, Maduro has shown no signs of giving in to America’s demands. In fact, he says the US is orchestrating a coup against him, which has led him to “revisit” his country’s diplomatic ties with the US. That doesn’t bother the Trump administration, which still actively speaks out against the regime while supporting Guaidó. In a Tuesday Wall Street Journal op-ed released just ahead of the protests, Pence called the National Assembly leader “courageous” for speaking out. The vice president also said the situation in Venezuela is a matter of US national security because the crisis exacerbates human trafficking, international crime, and the export of drugs, weapons, and terrorism. “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, the US will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,” Pence wrote. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has been among the most vocal advocating for the US to recognize Guaidó, which Trump did on Wednesday. “As the people of Venezuela stand in support of their country’s Provisional President Juan Guaidó and their right to self-determination, I applaud their courage in rising-up against Nicolás Maduro’s narco-terrorist tyranny,” Rubio told me. “The world supports [their] fight for freedom and democracy.” On the one hand, the US so forcefully speaking out against an odious regime is a good thing. America traditionally stands and fights for democracy around the world, at least in theory, and Maduro is clearly no democratic champion. On the other hand, such an avid push could be dangerous. Protesters may now understandably believe that the US government — and perhaps even the US military — has their backs. That could lead demonstrators to take risks they otherwise might not, hoping America will somehow come to their aid. Unless the Trump administration somehow plans to directly intervene in Venezuela, though, that’s unlikely. Which means that while Maduro may personally lose prestige after Wednesday’s demonstrations, he’ll still have the power to imperil his country even further. “Venezuela’s long and painful political stress test still has no clear end in sight,” Erikson, the former White House adviser on Latin America, told me.",https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/23/18193533/venezuela-maduro-protest-guaido-pence-trump-23-enero,,Vox
714,714,19-06-19 00:00,2019,6,19,,U.S. mortgage applications fall from 33-month high,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications declined last week from about a 33-month peak as most home borrowing costs moved up from their lowest levels since September 2017, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.  The Washington-based group’s seasonally adjusted index on loan requests, both to buy a home and to refinance one, fell to 511.8 in the week ended June 14. It fell 3.4% from the prior week’s 529.8, which was the highest reading since September 2016.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate “conforming” mortgages, or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less, averaged 4.14% last week. They were up 2 basis points from prior week’s 4.12%, the lowest level since September 2017.   Other 30-year mortgage rates MBA tracks were unchanged to 3 basis points higher from the week before.  Meanwhile, 15-year mortgage rates averaged 3 basis points lower at 3.50%, while the average borrowing costs on five-year adjustable home loans rose 2 basis points to 3.45%.  Mortgage rates generally increased in line with higher bond yields last week as traders pared their safe-haven bond holdings after U.S. President Donald Trump called off threatened tariffs on Mexico and encouraging data on retail sales and industrial output.  MBA’s seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing applications fell 3.5% to 1,888.8 from prior week’s 1,956.5, which was the highest since November 2016.  The refinance share of mortgage activity grew to 50.2% of total applications from 49.8% the week before.   “Borrowers were sensitive to rising rates, but the refinance share of applications was still at its highest level since January 2018, and refinance activity was at its second highest level this year,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.  The group’s barometer on loan applications for home purchases, which is seen as proxy on future housing activity, slipped 3.5% to 268.6. The latest figure was up almost 4% from a year ago.  “Strong demand from first-time buyers and low unemployment continue to push this year’s purchase activity above a year ago,” Kan said.

After noticing that his mood lifted whenever the 60-pound animal was around, he got a doctor's permission to bring him outside on a leash, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The 65-year-old, who lives about 100 miles west of Philadelphia, adopted Wally from Orlando, and came to increasingly rely on him for companionship after losing three close friends in quick succession. Wally spends his time in Henney's living room watching shows like Gator Boys on TV, eating chicken wings, and enjoying the occasional head-rub. When he's not wading in a 300-pound plastic pond, he's cuddling with his owner. Henney, who also owns a smaller gator named Scrappy, told the Inquirer that he's even let Wally sleep with him in his bed. ""We caress and wrestle. He loves to wrestle,” he said. ""He whacks me with his tail."" Henney is an animal lover who grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania, has nursed injured owls and ridden in rodeos. Raising a gator that might grow to be well over 1,000 pounds presumably presents a unique set of challenges, but he swears Wally is just a big sweetheart. He apparently ""likes to give hugs,"" and befriends goldfish and bullfrogs rather than eat them. He's also afraid of cats. Though Wally does meet-and-greets and is reportedly good with most of Henney's 18 grandkids, along with his initially skeptical girlfriend, not everyone is fully convinced that having an emotional support alligator is a great idea. The Inquirer reporter, who did say that the gator genuinely seemed to cuddle with Henney, wrote that he got a little riled whenever he put on his leash. And— even in a world where people are registering emotional support peacocks—the Service Dog Registration of America seemed to think that domesticating what's basically a dinosaur is taking things a step too far.

717,717,24-04-17 14:31,2017,4,24,David Anthony,"Black Flag’s 'Damaged' Is an Iconic Record, so Why Isn’t It More Influential?"," But the lineup that produced  Nervous Breakdown didn't last. Vocalist Keith Morris and drummer Brian Migdol left the band, with bassist Chuck Dukowski and guitarist/bandleader Greg Ginn soldiering on, finding new members to record with. But those new members would wash out just as quickly, establishing a pattern that would be repeated over and over again throughout Black Flag's history—even in the present day, with Ginn often asking strangers he meets at the grocery store to play bass.   By the time the band found itself on somewhat stable ground in the early 80s Black Flag's reputation had grown, for better and worse. Their shows in the southern California area often became full-on riots, making it hard for Black Flag to actually play music in a live setting. And though the group's first release established hardcore's ethos, it was the band's tireless commitment to touring that would establish the DIY touring network that so many young bands take for granted. Despite laying the groundwork for hardcore, and seemingly inventing an approach to touring that bands use to this day, Black Flag still had yet to put out a proper full-length album, even if the material was there. Long before their debut album,  Damaged, was released, the band would be playing these songs across the country, giving new kids an idea of what was to come, but also the ability to build upon it.  Before we go any further, it's important to state that  Damaged really is damn good. Even now, nearly 40 years on, the record remains a thrillride. From the anthemic ""Rise Above,"" to the riotous, us-against-them anger of ""Police Story,"" to the darkly introspective ""Depression,"" all the way down to the untethered lunacy of the album's closer ""Damaged I,"" each one of these moments captures something few records of that time did. And it still resonates. It's an introduction to late 70s, early 80s hardcore that's still exactly that for many people interested in the genre. But somehow, it feels as if it exists in a vacuum.   By the time of  Damaged's release in December of 1981, the sound Black Flag created was not only gaining traction throughout North America, it was mutating in every regional outpost that took to it. Soon after singer Henry Rollins joined Black Flag and moved to California, the bands Rollins came up alongside began getting attention. Minor Threat's unbridled anger and anti-drug ethos would inform the straight edge and youth crew movements that would come into vogue over the next decade. Bad Brains' groovy, warp-speed attacks would introduce a new set of virtuosity and flow to a genre often seen as being full of slipshod compositions. In both San Pedro, California, and Austin, Texas, the Minutemen and Big Boys would begin incorporating a funk-laced swing to hardcore's primal stomp. In San Francisco, the Dead Kennedys would offer a sardonic bit of storytelling and sci-fi to lyrics that were often simplistic sloganeering. Canada's NoMeansNo would take the Dead Kennedy's lyrical approach and incorporate it into their jazz-leaning compositions. Descendents were bringing oodles of pop hooks to the table and singing about fast food and coffee. And in the Midwest, Hüsker Dü was cranking the reverb until their songs sounded like rattling speakers instead of discernible guitar riffs. Hardcore had changed, but Black Flag was still Black Flag.   All that touring and interpersonal instability meant that Black Flag had been touring on the songs found on  Damaged for years, and instead of the songs feeling a part of the scenes that were revolutionizing the form, Black Flag felt, well, out of step with the world of hardcore. To kids craving a faster, louder, and harder version of the songs on  Nervous Breakdown,  Damaged sounded like the band getting lapped instead of setting the pace. By then, other bands began touring, and Black Flag went from being the only game in town to the band with a target on its back—after all, punks of that time didn't have a ton of interest in paying tribute to what came before it.   Much like Black Flag's reputation as a raucous live band hindered its ability to actually play shows in southern California, a failed distribution deal with Unicorn Records—a subsidiary of the major label MCA—would bungle  Damaged's release, too. The record didn't hit shelves across the country in the way the band hoped, though it still gained plenty of attention on its own, but the fiasco forced the band to distribute it through Ginn's own SST Records—taking on a lawsuit from Unicorn in the process.   This legal battle would make it nearly impossible for Black Flag to release new music, instead forcing the band to release the odds-and-ends collection  Everything Went Black and  The First Four Years compilation as holdovers. At a time when hardcore was reaching a fever pitch, Black Flag's growth was stunted, forced to rely on its old material at a time when fans were demanding something new and forward-thinking.   By the time Black Flag would re-emerge in 1984 with a trio of full-lengths, the band's sound had shifted dramatically—and so too had the hardcore scene. Bands had hit a wall creatively, many of which had broken-up, and it allowed Black Flag to swoop back in with  My War and reclaim the throne it had left vacant. The newly minted lineup of Rollins, Ginn, and Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson offered new direction in a way  Damaged never could.  My War was a mid-paced stomp, full of Ginn's stair-stepping, polyrhythmic riffs and Rollins' more refined vocal stylings. But it was the record's B-side, a three-song suite of lengthy, glacier-slow dirges that would—just like  Nervous Breakdown before it—launch a thousand ships.   Few records have Facebook pages dedicated to their B-sides, let alone can be seen as the nexus point for genres as disparate as sludge metal and grunge—that is, if Kurt Cobain's opinion is counted.  My War is the record that would allow bands like the Melvins to find a blueprint from which they could continually build upon, and it offered a different approach to the emerging crossover between hardcore and metal. If the songs that made up  The First Four Years collection offered hardcore a set of standards—exactly three million covers of ""Nervous Breakdown"" have been performed to date [citation needed]—My War paved a path forward, even, if it lead to the band's destruction in 1986.   But what about  Damaged, the iconic first record from hardcore's biggest name? Despite being a record that's basically flawless, it's hard to see what lasting influence it's had on the genre it is tied to. In a way, it became the gateway to hardcore for kids with a budding interest in hardcore, and it's often times the single hardcore record that non-hardcore fans have heard. The cover of  Damaged—which, in a staged photo, sees Rollins breaking a mirror with his balled fist—is as iconic as Metallica's  Master Of Puppets. Even if you don't know what  Damaged sounds like, the cover tells you  exactly what it sounds like. It's what has made it the perfect shorthand for teenage rebellion, exemplified by James Franco nodding along to it in an episode of  Freaks And Geeks making perfect sense to fans of an NBC comedy.   Through the 90s and early 2000s, hardcore continued to evolve, with new sub-genres popping up and bands became less tethered to its history. Much like trends in rap today, hardcore moved incredibly fast back then, experimenting with new sounds and approaches, and having less interest in idol worship. Where the music found on  The First Four Years offered bands a way to something new,  Damaged felt tied to hardcore's gestational period instead of its invigorating present.  While none of this diminishes  Damaged's place in history, it can't help but feel like an album whose imprint on the actual sound of hardcore got lost along the way. The two-year gap between  Nervous Breakdown and  Damaged  isn't a long time, but it was enough to keep Black Flag from setting a true benchmark with its first album. Sure, every kid in a hardcore band says they like Black Flag, but how many of them are talking about the Black Flag found on  Damaged? David Anthony's got nothing to do but shoot his mouth off on Twitter.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gv7d74/black-flags-damaged-is-an-iconic-record-so-why-isnt-it-more-influential,Noisey,Vice

Kidd Kidd – SQ4, 2002 Kyle: One of the great things about deciding to blog about Lil Wayne for a year​ is that, if you are a person with cool friends such as myself (I definitely have friends, and many of them, I promise), other people think the idea sounds fun and want to join in, potentially relieving you of the burden of actually having good insights every day. Not that I wouldn't. But I'm taking no chances. Plus, having guests keeps the format fresh! My first guest is my new colleague Lawrence, who just started working at Noisey this week. Welcome Lawrence! He knows a lot about Lil Wayne and has good opinions. We're going to try something out: On Fridays, Lawrence will join in and we'll have a chat about a Lil Wayne song. This week, Lawrence sent me a bunch of Wayne songs, including this one from the famous Sqad Up mixtape run​, a period of Wayne with which I have to admit I am not very familiar. It is Jay Z and Eminem's ""Renegade"" beat, and it features 2015 XXL Freshman Kidd Kidd! It was released in 2002. You do the math on that one. Anyway, Lawrence, this is the first song you wanted us to discuss, so tell me a bit about what it is and why you like it. Lawrence: The era of Sqad Up Wayne is kind of my coming-of-age period in my Weezy fandom. My first interactions with Wayne came really early—I was probably in third or fourth grade. The game had to be passed down to me. My older sister had every desirable album stacked up in her room: Hot Boyz, Three 6 Mafia, Jay-Z, Lil Kim, etc. When she was out, I would slip in there and steal her albums to listen. I listened to Tha Block Is Hot probably every day. I wanted to be a Hot Boy. My cousin and I specifically asked our parents for Reebok Classics and we would walk to school swagged out in a nightgown-length white tee, jeans, and our Freaky Ree's. My stepbrothers showed me Baller Blockin' when I was about ten—way too young to be watching it.  By the time Hot Boys were done, and Wayne started to develop an identity as a solo act, I was fresh into middle school and feeling myself. I was at an age where I didn't need the game given to me. All the older dudes on my block were raving over how much better Wayne had gotten and they started playing Sqad Up tapes on our porches. I got absorbed by it and started playing those tracks all day long. It was the first time I felt like I was choosing the music I was taking in. It made me feel grown. I didn't need to scavenge my sister's collection or wait for my stepbrothers to come through with the bootleg DVD. I started trading mixtapes with my friends around the way and I'd go home, upload them to Windows Media Player and burn them for myself. The tape I played and burned the most out of that Wayne era was SQ4, by far. I had no idea Lil Wayne could rap like that. Nobody did. It was the start of his true rise to being respected as a proper MC.  Looking back, ""Renegades"" always sticks out the most to me, and I revisit it all the time. I makes me miss the fun in rappers regularly jacking for beats. The whole SQ series is nothing more than a seven-part flex on the industry, and Wayne took on a song here that, at that time, probably felt untouchable for most. This is one of the few instances (possibly only) where the public decided that Jay was lyrically upstaged on a track of his own, so for a 19-year-old to grab hold of this and spit shit like, ""I'm younger than Kobe, vet like Rob Horry / I made it hot, bubbly, your buddy is getting chubbier than N.O.R.E."" and ""If this was the block, I'd be moving a eighth or more / But I soar through the block in that grape Azzure / I see hate galore but I straight ignore because my cake is more / Peep how your date adore"" I'm smiling to myself as I'm listening and typing right now because this is gassing me. I have to acknowledge the horrid ""rape your whore"" line in there and be thankful that most of us—both rappers and fans—are better educated on such irresponsible takes. Overall, this is one of the most relentless displays of Wayne's early career, and it should be acknowledged when recognizing his greatness.  Kyle: ""Wayne came to paint your kitchen,"" and, truly, he did. If we're talking greatness, let's talk about how he raps a single verse for three minutes straight. Or how he just becomes the song here, using his voice percussively as he bounces through the various twists and turns of his verse, until the beat kind of just fades away as background noise. A great Wayne tactic is how he just continually hammers rhymes home for far longer than is possibly logical, like he does here with the ""oy"" sound at the beginning of the verse (including twisting the word ""boy"" about four directions). Another is the way he'll just chew on words and roll them around in his mouth, like he does with the word ""road"" here. Wayne doesn't just rap words, he creates new forms of expression. I'm probably going to say that again at some point, but it doesn't make it any less true. This song? It's good. ​Follow Lawrence Burney on Twitter​.

Ben Roethlisberger is playing MVP-caliber quarterback, the Steelers' multi-dimensional backfield is blowing everyone's doors off, and Kevin Colbert apparently found the legendary Fountain of Wide Receivers in the mountains of western Pennsylvania. Yet a funny thing keeps happening to this unstoppable winning machine: They keep losing to mediocre teams. The Steelers flew down to miserable Miami, where the newly christened Hard Rock Stadium has seen plenty of Easy Listening football. There, a Dolphins squad that needed overtime to beat the Cleveland Browns—and tally their only win so far this season—skunked the Steelers, 30-15. The 34-3 shocker Pittsburgh suffered in Week 3 felt like an ignorable outlier, a perfect storm of one-off foibles and failures: An in-state rivalry game featuring a little-seen rookie quarterback executing a picture-perfect Philadelphia Eagles gameplan that exploited a mismatch of scatback Darren Sproles on beefy linebacker Ryan Shazier. Roethlisberger was sacked four times and picked off once by a new-look Eagles defense. Wendell Smallwood scored a touchdown, and I don't know if he's even a real guy. This time around in Miami, the failures felt real. Roethlisberger was picked off twice by a defense that had only one interception all year—tied for last in the NFL. He was sacked twice, and temporarily knocked out of the game by a pass rush that ranked 18th in sacks. The Steelers' ground attack was nonexistent against the NFL's worst rushing defense; Darrius Heyward-Bey's gimmicky 60-yard scamper on a jet sweep nearly matched the rest of the team's rushing total (68 yards): It was just as bad on the other side of the ball. The Steelers defense had allowed just 77 rushing yards per game over their first five games. But Dolphins tailback Jay Ajayi rambled for 204 yards on just 25 attempts. Beleaguered quarterback Ryan Tannehill posted his highest-rated game of the season (97.4). This is the scariest thing about these two losses: It's not just one thing, it's everything. Roethlisberger gutted out the rest of the game, but told NFL Network's Aditi Kinkhabwala his knee ""obviously hurts"" and will be getting an MRI: Of course, the season's far from over. The Steelers are 4-2, and still one game clear of the rest of the AFC North. But they face the New England Patriots next week, and could easily go into their bye week 4-3 (and definitively not among the AFC's best). Until this afternoon, the Steelers seemed to be an offensive Doomsday Machine chewing up the rest of the league.

724,724,19-06-19 00:00,2019,6,19,Howard Schneider,"WRAPUP 1-Fed likely to leave rates steady, despite market outlook and Trump demands","WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday expected to leave interest rates on hold but flag whether it plans to cut rates later this year as investors expect and the U.S. president has demanded.  The central bank may nod to recent weaker-than-expected jobs numbers and softer inflation, and drop from its policy statement a pledge to be “patient” before changing rates - opening the door to a possible rate reduction later.  But the level of concern raised around fresh economic risks, and the language Chairman Jerome Powell uses in his post-meeting press conference, will be read by investors and perhaps even more significantly by President Donald Trump as a sign of whether officials are poised to act soon or are still biding their time.  The policy statement and new economic projections are to be released at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), followed by a Powell press conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).  “If they don’t (reduce the interest rate) in June, the words he uses are going to have to be pretty careful that they are open to July,” said Mark Stoeckle, CEO of Adams Funds, which caters mostly to individual investors.  Fed policymakers “don’t want to make it sound like (they) are beholden to the market or to the president,” he said, but even a token single rate cut in July “buys you some time to get more data ... It saves face for everybody.”  As Fed officials gathered in Washington on Tuesday, news reports surfaced describing efforts by Trump earlier in the year to determine if he could remove Powell as chairman of the central bank.  Powell, as head of an independent agency, is thought to be insulated from such a move by law. Still it was a reminder to policymakers that as Trump gears up his 2020 reelection effort he remains convinced the Fed is hampering an economy whose performance may prove central to his chances at a second term.  Fighting a trade war on several fronts and with some expectation growth may slow this year, he has singled out central banks globally for his ire. He has noted that China’s monetary policy was shaped by politicians in a way he felt left him at a disadvantage in trade negotiations.  On Tuesday he slammed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi for raising the possibility of fresh stimulus to bolster weak European growth, which Trump saw through the lens of a weaker euro, a stronger dollar, and higher prices for U.S. exports.  “Very unfair to the United States!,” Trump said on Twitter.  But for a year the criticism of Powell has been biting, and on Tuesday Trump sent a thinly veiled threat as Fed officials were in the middle of their two-day deliberation over rates.  Asked by reporters outside the White House if he wanted to demote Powell, Trump said “let’s see what he does.”  The Fed’s short-term overnight interest rate influences a variety of other borrowing costs. That shapes economic activity by determining what consumers pay to buy houses and cars, how investors evaluate assets, and even what happens in a stock market that Trump often cites as a proxy for his performance.  Fed officials feel their four interest rate increases last year, far from crimping the recovery, were an appropriate response to the fact that Trump’s tax and spending policies pushed the economy, at least temporarily, to accelerate faster than had been expected. In the Fed’s view they helped guard against inflation, possible financial market bubbles and other problems.  But since then other risks have become more central, including the danger that some of Trump’s own trade policies may damage a global economic expansion in more profound ways than initially thought, undermining business confidence and slowing investment and hiring.  That narrative has caused investors to bet that the Fed this year will approve two or three reductions of a quarter-percentage-point to the federal funds target rate, set in a range of between 2.25% and 2.5% since December.  New projections for the appropriate year-end policy rate are unlikely to match those expectations. To do so would require the bulk of the 17 policymakers to cut their rate outlook by a half a percentage point or more, a large shift by historic standards.  Not only do Fed officials downplay risk of a serious economic slump in the near future, they also, somewhat ironically, see Trump’s very volatility as a reason to remain noncommittal.  Just as unexpected tariff threats sent markets down in early May, the possibility of progress toward a China-U.S. trade deal, which helped markets rally on Tuesday, has led some officials to want to keep their options open.

Like, sometimes it seems crazy that you even hang out with people who make such crappy decisions. Stuff that, were it to get out, would be mortifying for anyone with even a shred of self-respect. Lucky for your friends, they've got you to ask their deepest, darkest questions for them. And lucky for you, we started this new column to answer those most embarrassing of queries. The scenario: Your ""friend"" strips the bed, oh, every couple of months. What you're afraid of: You'll He'll contract a flesh-eating disease and/or scare off a potential mate. The considerations: ""When you don't wash your sheets, large quantities of particulates accumulate, including human skin cells,"" Philip Tierno Jr., a professor of microbiology and pathology at the NYU School of Medicine, told VICE. ""Those cells serve as foodstuff for dust mites, whose feces are very allergenic."" As in, they can cause coughing, sneezing, itchy eyes, and postnasal drip.  On top of that, dirty sheets can collect fungal spores, mold, insect parts, dust, lint, and pollen, all of which can exacerbate allergies and asthma if you inhale them for eight hours a night, Tierno said. Worse, staph bacteria can survive on bedding that isn't regularly washed in hot water. For the most part, staph tends to live harmlessly on skin and inside nostrils (or it causes minor infections), but on rare occasions it can be fatal if it gets into the bloodstream via a cut. Technically you or a guest could carry staph onto freshly laundered sheets, but the longer you go without washing them, the more staph builds up in your bed and the higher the likelihood is of it infecting you. On a less concerning note, the cosmetics, lotions, oils, and other products your buddy puts on his face and hair pile up on your—er, his—pillowcase and are transferred back to his skin if he sleeps on his side or stomach. Hence his regular breakouts. The worst thing that could actually happen: Your friend will get a drug-resistant, life-threatening staph infection. What is more likely to happen: His allergies will get worse, or he'll develop new ones. What to do: Here's what Tierno suggests to keep allergies, infections, and acne in check: Throw your sheets in the washer once a week, and invest in protection. ""Even if you wash weekly, you still have buildup in the core of your mattress and pillows,"" he said. ""You can't get it out, but you can prevent further deposits and trap what's already in there with mattress and pillow protectors."" The National Sleep Foundation recommends PureCare covers.

Trumka, who is head of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), said on Fox News of Trump’s policies: “Unfortunately, to date, the things that he’s done to hurt workers outpace what he’s done to help workers.”  The AFL-CIO president cited changes to the tax code that encourage companies to outsource jobs, the administration’s failure to produce an infrastructure program and its overturning of regulations, including some protecting health and safety.  On Monday, the national Labor Day holiday, Trump tweeted that Trumka had represented his union “poorly.”  “Some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country, and the success of the U.S. itself, that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly,” Trump added.  In follow-up tweets, the president hailed economic growth, adding: “The Worker in America is doing better than ever before!”  A spokesman for Trumka, John Weber, declined to comment on Trump’s tweets.  Trumka had also questioned Trump’s Saturday tweet that there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The president warned Congress not to meddle with the trade negotiations or he would terminate the trilateral trade pact altogether.   “It’s pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal,” Trumka said on Sunday, noting that the economies of Mexico, the United States and Canada were heavily integrated.   Trumka, who met with Trump alongside other labor leaders last month to talk about trade issues, is a highly influential figure on trade issues and his support will likely be necessary for the passage of any legislation on trade promoted by the administration.  Democrats are working to get union members to vote in the Nov. 6 midterm congressional elections.  Former Vice President Joe Biden marched in a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, campaigning on behalf of Democrats. “We’re in a fight for the soul of America,” he said. “It’s about time we restore dignity to work.”  Reporting by Michelle Price; Additional reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Dan Grebler",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-labor/on-labor-day-trump-hits-back-at-largest-union-leader-idUSKCN1LJ1H1,Politics,Reuters

Though the Louisiana coast remained calm as of early Tuesday evening, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production.  “I’m asking all residents to do their part in getting ready for this storm,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement. “The city’s absolute No.1 priority is to ensure the safety of our residents.”  Tropical-storm force winds were already lashing the Alabama and western Florida panhandle coastlines and some areas still recovering from last year’s storms could see 12 inches (30 cm) of rain.  Beaches around Mobile, Alabama were washed by storm-driven waves, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.   “We’re expecting an increase in winds,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “We could see flooding.”  Sea levels could rise as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said.   The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate.   At LaFrance Marina near Ansley, Mississippi, a mile north of Heron Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, marina owner Sue Cates said that a tidal surge is sure to push water into the marina’s low-lying campgrounds, making evacuation “the only choice” people have to protect themselves.   Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will remain in their home, which sits on tall pilings, 24 feet above ground. Built after Hurricane Katrina, the home is made to withstand a 150 mile-an-hour wind, she said.  “We’re way up here, and I think we’ll be OK,” Cates said. “People around here are well-trained for this sort of thing.”  U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities.   The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and   Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours.      Last year, hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing widespread destruction and thousands of deaths.  The Inn at Ocean Springs and the Roost Hotel in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, had guests planning to ride out the storm, said Kristin Smith, general manager of both hotels.   “A lot of guests are real comfortable sticking it out in our rooms,” Smith said in a telephone interview. “Any of our guests who feel like they want to go home we encourage them to follow their instincts.”  Reporting by Kathy Finn in NEW ORLEANS; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in NEW YORK, Brendan O'Brien in MILWAUKEE, Scott Malone in BOSTON and Dan Whitcomb in LOS ANGELES; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Lisa Shumaker and Darren Schuettler",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-gordon/tropical-storm-gordon-makes-landfall-near-alabama-mississippi-border-idUSKCN1LK0V8,Environment,Reuters

Undocumented immigrants scheduled for deportation will lock their doors this weekend as federal agents scour some of the largest U.S. cities looking to make arrests. They’ll take sanctuary in churches. They’ll keep their lawyers and advocates close.  But they’ll be ready.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are expected to swarm nine major cities on Sunday to arrest thousands of undocumented family members in a massive, multi-day raid, according to the New York Times, which spoke to three anonymous officials on the matter. The raids were supposed to start two weeks ago but were postponed after Democrats objected. Raids are typically a surprise, but media attention and the postponement allowed advocates time to prepare.  The target cities include Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Baltimore, Denver, Miami, and San Francisco. New Orleans was initially on the list, but ICE operations there were suspended due to tropical storm Barry.  While the raids are meant to target 2,000 undocumented immigrants who have already received deportation orders, they’ll also likely result in “collateral” deportations that sweep up not-targeted immigrants who happen to be nearby during arrests. Already, a massive family detention center in Dilley, Texas, has stopped admitting new detainees so it can clear more room for the families immigration officials expect to sweep this weekend.  But it’s unclear how successful the raids might be in achieving the goal to break up families and send people back to their countries of origin, since President Donald Trump tweeted about the raid weeks ago and gave immigrants and advocates ample time to prepare, change addresses, and read up on their legal rights. (When ICE officials are choosing which immigrants to target, they’ll typically gather data like a person’s last address and place of employment.) Trump criticized the mayor of Oakland, California, for similarly giving immigrants a heads-up ahead of a raid last year.  “The immigrant community knows that this is coming, and we’re doing everything we can to prepare,” said Omar Angel Perez, the lead organization for the Congregation Action Network in the D.C. area.  The ICE raids were scheduled to take place in late June, but Trump postponed them after Democrats expressed outrage. He handed them an ultimatum instead: reach a Congressional deal on asylum reform and emergency funding for the border, or the raids would be rescheduled. Congress failed to take action within two weeks, and it was widely reported earlier this week that the raids were back on. ICE has repeatedly said it doesn’t comment on the timing or details of planned operations.  Still, advocacy organizations had time to host know-your-rights trainings, and churches had time to see if their congregants would be willing to take in families hiding from ICE.  Advocates have also been reminding immigrants that ICE agents aren’t allowed to force their way into a home if they don’t have a warrant signed by a judge.  Plus, immigration officials typically won’t make arrests at hospitals, churches, or schools — turning some of those places into sanctuaries for immigrants.  That doesn’t mean people won’t be scared or intimidated into giving up their rights at their home or a sanctuary, though, said Fernando Andrade, a paralegal with the immigrant protection unit of the The New York Legal Assistance Group. He urged people who have to leave their homes or sanctuaries to go to work to form a contingency plan with family members in the event they’re arrested, and talk with their bosses.  He said his group has been urging immigrants to carry so-called “red cards” offered by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. The cards offer a script recommended for non-citizens who are approached by law enforcement, reading “I do not wish to speak with you, answer your questions, or sign or hand you any documents based on my Fifth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.” READ: Why Jews are getting themselves arrested at ICE centers around the country “We’re not sugarcoating anything — this might happen,” Andrade said. “If ICE comes to your door, don’t open the door. Be firm. It’s going to be hostile. Ask them if they have any warrant.” “If ICE comes to your door, don’t open the door. Be firm. It’s going to be hostile. Ask them if they have any warrant.” The American Civil Liberties Union also filed a preemptive lawsuit Thursday demanding any arrested immigrants receive a fair court hearing ahead of any deportation process, since they may have missed a previous court hearing due to bureaucratic errors or ignorance of the system.  It’s not uncommon for immigrants and asylum-seekers placed on the U.S. immigration system’s fast-tracked docket programs to miss their initial hearings. Undocumented immigrants might lack legal representation or awareness of how the U.S. immigration system works, putting them at risk for deportation orders. Nearly 100 percent of migrant families who have legal representation and know they need to appear in court do show up, according to the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. That’s why some advocates find Sunday’s sweep unfair.  “For the many families who came here as refugees fleeing violence, deportation is a death threat. We will fight to ensure no one faces this kind of peril without having their case considered in court,” Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a news release Friday.

731,731,13-06-19 00:00,2019,6,13,Roberta Rampton,White House says it will meet two-year deadline for Huawei ban for contractors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House Office of Management and Budget has told the U.S. Congress it will now meet a two-year deadline to ban federal contracts with companies that do business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, part of a defense law passed last year, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  “Congress has made it clear in recent days the importance of implementing the law within the two years provided, and we will,” Russ Vought, the acting director of OMB, said in a letter to Senator James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Last week the OMB had said it would need more time to implement the ban, which requires third-party suppliers and contractors to restrict their purchases and use of Huawei equipment.  But the White House reversed course after “recent conversations with Congress,” Vought said in the letter dated Wednesday.  “As we move forward to meet the statutory deadline without further delay, we will work with Congress to address any unforeseen issues that arise,” Vought said.  The ban is one part of a multifaceted U.S. push against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world’s largest telecoms network gear maker, which Washington accuses of espionage and stealing intellectual property.  Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. It has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the restrictions in the defense policy bill.  The defense law, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), placed a broad ban on the use of federal money to purchase products from Huawei, citing national security concerns.  It included a ban on direct federal purchases of Huawei equipment, which will take effect this year.

732,732,01-05-17 18:01,2017,5,1,Mike Steyels,Uninamise Is Bringing Brooklyn’s Flex Dance Music to the World," Last summer, a dance circle broke out in Boiler Room's small, raw space in Brooklyn. Inside, performers battled and sessioned to driving dancehall riddims as a crowd looked on, many standing on the benches lining the wall to get a better view. This was one of the first times that flex dance music, or FDM, was broadcast to an international audience, and Uninamise was one of four selectors behind the decks.  Known as Willie Perkins to family, Uninamise is a Brooklyn-born producer who's reserved around new people and usually has braids sticking out from under a dad hat. For him, as with most producers in the genre, it all started with a Brooklyn public access TV show called Flex N Brooklyn. The show first aired as an outlet for hip-hop and reggae dancing in 1992, though flexing didn't crystallize as a form in its own right until the late 90s, and it didn't get a name until the mid-2000s. On the show, dancers would perform on stage in front of an audience, who would in turn get a chance to dance in the crowd for the cameras.   The original flex dancers were versed in a similar style of dance called bruk up, which had come straight from Jamaica. But they kept adding their own contributions until people in the streets began calling them ""flex dancers,"" after the show's name. The dance is centered around a few basic elements, which include ""gliding,"" a sort of 3D version of the moonwalk, and ""bonebreaking,"" a series of arm contortions any escape artist would be jealous of.  The music associated with the dancing consists mostly of dark, electronic instrumental dancehall, with chopped-up samples and riddims at its core. In its early days, producers created flex tunes by of stacking riddims like ""Volume"" and ""Anger Management"" on top of each other, adding in a few new elements for personal style. Eventually, they started producing the tunes from scratch, but those sounds remain a hallmark of the style.  Uninamise first became interested in the scene after hearing classmates talk about the show during early middle school in Flatbush—an epicenter of the nascent flexing culture. ""I saw the showcases and used to watch dudes dancing in the park, on the train, at block parties—practicing on their bruk up and all that,"" he remembers over the phone from his current home in upstate New York.  Soon, his family moved a few neighborhoods away—first to Coney Island, and then to Sheepshead Bay, where they lived in a one-family house. But Flatbush kept drawing him back. Eventually, he started getting involved in flexing as a dancer. At first, he specialized in a style called ""connecting,"" a flexing element where every movement is based off which part of the body you last touched (i.e. the hand touches the elbow, which touches the knee, and so on). ""Sometimes we used to cut school and go to the park to play basketball or dance, and record songs with a little camera,"" he remembers. ""We'd post them to Youtube.""  In 2006, dancing was everything in Flatbush. Alongside the flexers, some dancers were still doing the bruk up, and there were shotta dancers, too, which was another style imported from Jamaica. (Shottas used moves popular on the island like ""pon di river,"" where you lift and sort of wiggle your foot in front of you like you're testing the water's temperature.) Teen dance parties flourished at local event spaces and social clubs like Sea Breeze, Elks lodges, and the Brooklyn Masons. Even the Empire Skate Rink had a teen night where flexers could be found. ""There were these party crews throwing events,"" Uninamise explains. ""We used to go to the ones that DJed more dance songs. The DJ would go back and forth. You would dance, maybe grinding and stuff. Do the shotta dances. Then you'd hear flex; the riddims would come on."" By 2007 or 2008, when Uninamise was in high school, the Empire Skating Rink shuttered, and Flex N Brooklyn stopped airing. A couple years later, other venues followed suit. ""A couple people got killed,"" Uninamise recalls. ""Crazy shoot ups. It stopped a lot of the parties."" In the absence of regular parties, Flexing had been becoming increasingly battle-oriented, revolving around sessions like Regg Roc's Flexhouse and Kareem Baptise's Battlefest. Though Uninamise was still involved in the battles, he'd also been producing rap beats and learning his way around a studio, mostly at a local spot in Crown Heights, where some older heads taught him things like Protools and chords. Later, after high school, he'd end up at Puff Daddy's Bad Boy studios, where he knew one of the A&Rs. ""I got ripped off for a beat,"" he recalls. ""That's why I stopped going there. Like, when you recorded in there, they took everything. But it was a good experience. It was after high school, and I didn't have anything really to do.""  In his mid-20s, Uninamise finally started making FDM tunes in earnest. In 2014, he dropped one of his first tracks, ""Murdera,"" an aggressive exhibition of rolling percussion made in collaboration with Doc, a well known dancer born Ares Fraizer. Soon after, Uninamise unveiled the  Kaviar Dreams mixtape, which drew from the atmospheric vibes he'd cultivated through studying other genres. The dancers immediately embraced it—""As soon as I dropped it, that's when the push was crazy,"" he says.   Still, he decided to keep it low-key for a while, dancing simply as ""Will"" but producing under his new alias, Uninamise. ""Nobody knew it was me, but everybody loved its sound quality,"" he says. ""Nobody was making sound quality like that.""   At that time, Hitmakerchinx and DJ Aaron were the biggest producers in flexing culture, though Epic B had also started making a name for himself. Along with Uninamise, they're considered pioneers in FDM, though there are other producers, like DJ Blue and Doc, who were influential in building the sound. Uninamise often collaborates with these artists, helping boost their production quality so their individual styles can shine. ""Fate Of Two Worlds""—a collaboration with Blue full of arpeggiated lasers and apocalyptic choral samples—emphasizes this community building, bringing the urgent, earth-shaking quality of earlier flex tunes into clearer focus.  As an ambassador of the scene, he's frequently called upon for gigs outside of the dance circuit that birthed his music, like spinning on The Lot Radio or playing the odd Boiler Room party. ""When I play, it's a mixture of dancehall and FDM,"" Uninamise explains. ""Some people might not like some of the rhythms or might not get it. But once you start mixing in the dancehall, everybody goes crazy. We always bring a dancer, and they'll put on a little performance, too.""  Uninamise doesn't dance much these days, unless it's behind a pair of CDJs. But dancing still plays a big role in his music. He likes creating with friends and writing tunes as they try out new moves, freestyling ideas on the spot: ""I do everything on the speakers,"" he says. ""They might hear a certain sound, and come up with some weird ideas. It's back and forth. I look at the styles, see what story they create.""  With his greater visibility, Uninamise's now focused on spreading FDM throughout the world. At the end of May, he plans on releasing a tape of Weeknd remixes called  FDMBOY, which has the potential to be his most accessible release to date.  On the one hand, it draws out the Canadian singer's melodic and moody tendencies, reorienting them towards the dancefloor with detailed and dynamic percussion. On the other, it gives FDM newcomers something to latch onto in the flurry of crackling rhythms and thunderous percussion—a familiar voice calling out in the darkness.   But he's keeping thing grassroots too, reaching out to dancers along the East Coast. In Jersey, where there's a smaller flexing scene brewing, he helped teach up-and-coming producer Mastermind the ropes. And in Virginia, he's working with a couple more producers. There's Yokai, who uses soul samples, or will grab a 90s Wu Tang beat and turn it into a flex track; and there's Klasick, a dancer who comes from a krumping background and mixes that sound into his flex tunes.   Still, for Uninamise, even as the sound spreads, it all comes back to borough that birthed it. ""When I play at these new parties,"" he says, ""people come up to me and say, 'This sounds like  Brooklyn.'""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bm9wpq/uninamise-fdmboy-interview-flex-dance-music,Noisey,Vice

737,737,29-01-19 05:00,2019,1,29,Philip Eil,The Secret Lives of People Obsessed with Going Deep Underground,"Will Hunt has completed an impressive number of trips below the Earth’s surface. He’s done some of the more obvious, urban-explorer stuff, like visiting sewers and subway tunnels in New York City, or trekking from one end of Paris to another in a below-ground excursion where, as he put it, “every step... of course, would be illegal.” But he’s also walked through labyrinthine tunnel-towns in Turkey, explored an ochre mine in Australia believed to be sacred by local aboriginal descendants, and taken an elevator a mile down into an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota, where NASA-affiliated microbiologists are studying intraterrestrial life. At one point, he spent 24 hours in a cave in West Virginia for an unofficial experiment in the psychological effects of being immersed in what he described as “heavy, ancient... Book-of-Genesis dark.” (After just a couple of hours, he saw “small glowing orbs of light...moving in a soft, pulsing dance” and felt an “uncanny weightlessness.”) As Hunt’s journey—research for his new book  Underground: a Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet—progresses, you get the sense these forays are about more than just an adrenaline rush. What Hunt is really chasing, through the muck and darkness and stench and clammy cold, is a story of shared humanity. “Virtually every accessible cave on the planet contains the footprints of our ancestors,” he writes, adding, “The dark zone journey may well be humankind’s oldest continuous cultural practice, with archaeological evidence going back hundreds of thousands of years, before our species even existed.”  He finds similar threads of universality in practices of mining, burrowing, and religion. In one chapter, he explains how creation stories about life beginning underground are found in “cultures in every part of the world,” from France to Mexico to Australia to India to Eastern Europe to Native American tribes such as the Zuñi and Hopi. In another, he argues it’s “impossible to overstate” just how frequently we find stories of seers and prophets descending into caves to achieve new wisdom and altered states of consciousness, from shamans of the Shoshone and Lakote, to oracles in ancient Greece and Rome, to mystics in the Wolof culture of Senegal, to characters in both the Old and New Testament, to Muhammad, the founder of Islam. “Our connection to caves may well be our most universal, most deeply inscribed, perhaps our  original religious tradition,” he suggests.  In other words, to step below ground, whether through a manhole or the mouth of a cave, is to be reminded of who we are as a species and what we share.  I recently spoke to Hunt, a freelance writer and visiting scholar at New York University’s Institute for Public Knowledge, about his trips into a “parallel reality,” and the place he calls “our ghost landscape, unfolding everywhere beneath our feet, always out of view.”  VICE: What do you like so much about going underground? Will Hunt: I first fell in love with the underground in Providence, Rhode Island, when I was a teenager. I discovered the [abandoned train] tunnel running under the East Side, which I found to run almost directly beneath my house. It was a tremendous revelation for me, because... here’s this patch of Providence where my family has been living for a long time, and I thought I knew every corner of it, and it was revealed to me that there was this enormous, mysterious, echoing space directly beneath that. And while I didn’t have the self-awareness or the language to articulate this at the time, that’s been a theme in my falling in love with the underground, which is that you can be walking through any landscape on the surface and think you know it, and beneath your feet there is magic. There’s these giant, ancient caverns. There are tombs. There are cemeteries. There’s all kinds of strange infrastructure that are just out of view, but they’re there, and they are affecting our lives, and they embody our history. So that’s one level. [Then] when I was in New York—where I fell deeper in love with the underground after exploring under Providence—I started going underground in a way where I was really enjoying the thrill. It throws you for a sensory loop. It switches you outside of your everyday reality. So there’s something extraordinary about dropping into a sewer with a couple urban explorer friends, and within the space of a few feet, you’re only ten feet beneath the surface, but you’re inside of this hole, you’re in total darkness, you’re hearing echoes that you don’t hear on the surface. You’re smelling things. You access this wrinkle in reality that you didn’t even know existed.  Later in this process, as I travel a lot and [have] been to all of these underground spaces, what I really enjoy now is it’s this lens into humanity. We’ve had this really deep relationship with underground spaces forever. And it kind of brings out what’s most interesting [and] what’s most exciting about humans. We tend to become obsessed. We dream about subterranean spaces. We slip into altered states of consciousness. We’re irrational or messy or disorderly. And I feel like that nature in us is embodied in the decision to not stay on the surface and to go into darkness. If we were rational creatures living for the economics of everyday life, we would stay on the surface. There’s no reason to go into the dark, but we do.   There’s a moment in the book that takes place in a cave in France, when you’re led through various chambers to the room where there are these ancient clay sculptures of bison. And at that moment, you start to cry. Why was that moment so emotional for you?One of the things that’s so extraordinary about subterranean spaces and the subterranean landscape [is that] everything is magnified underground. It’s like your entire nervous system is like blooming. So everything you encounter in a subterranean space, in pitch darkness, when you’re surrounded by these strange echoes, is inherently magnified. It just feels so dramatic. It’s really like being inside of a separate reality. So that was one level of just the dramatic tension of crawling through this cave for several hours and you’re kind of totally detached from the surface world and you emerge into this really small chamber, in complete darkness, and everything is exactly as it has been for 14,000 years. You can see the fingerprints of the people who made those sculptures. You can see their footprints in the mud. [And] beyond the sensory level it’s... this confrontation with the roots of humanity. You’re looking at something that is, history-wise, time-wise, so removed from you, and yet it feels so familiar. Whatever drove the people who made those sculptures to go that deep into the cave to create these artworks was powerful, was something urgent. Otherwise there was no reason for them to go to such lengths. And even though we can’t really say what that thing was, as humans, when you’re in that space, you can feel it. You can feel the electricity of whatever it was that moved them, that compelled them to make those bison where they did.  Before reading this book, I didn’t necessarily think a lot about life underground, from microscopic creatures to larger animals. I suspect I'm not alone. But you spend a fair amount of time talking about exactly that. Just how much life is there we don't really see?This is one of my favorite things to talk about. Because when I was writing the chapter about microbes and bacteria, [I was] thinking, “Oh God, no one is going to give a shit about this.” Because who cares about microbes, right? But the thing is, in the underground there is a such a wild abundance of life. It’s just teeming. And it’s this extraordinary thing because, just a couple decades ago, most people assumed that that it was a desert inside of our planet. And it turns out that there[are] billion of tons of life beneath the surface of the earth. It’s more, by weight, than all of [current] human life combined. [So] on one hand, yes, there are these little wriggling single-cell organisms, and who cares? At the same time, that’s fucking crazy. It’s like on the scale of a Copernican revolution for me, to realize that surface life on the planet is perhaps the minority. That’s amazing.  Were you surprised by how many different kinds of people—and how many people, period—you met underground in your research?When I started spending time in New York, [I] discovered that there basically was just a whole tribe of people in New York who were tunnel enthusiasts, and then learned that it was not only in New York, but like every city in the world had a similar tribe of urban explorers, some of whom are extremely intense. And then beyond that, I was going into the world and almost testing this thesis a little bit, trying to find the bottom of that fascination with the underground. I wanted to know how deep and broad this relationship was. And what I saw was that it’s bottomless. It’s everywhere. We have had this very visceral relationship with subterranean spaces with as long as we’ve been human and much longer. And that was what was so exciting, as far as putting a book together, which was that this is something that is inside of all of us. Even if it’s latent and vestigial, we all have this. We’re all descended from people who had this relationship with underground spaces. There are certain people who are afflicted with this fascination more than others, and I am one of them. But everywhere I went, I just found people who way moreso than me had dedicated their entire lives to going underground, from these compulsive burrowers to cave explorers to graffiti artists.  In the book you briefly mention billionaires who have been building underground living spaces. And I’m wondering if you think, as the surface of the earth becomes less and less habitable due to climate change and other reasons, that in the future we’re going to see more people living underground.Absolutely. I think it’s kind of a dark, depressing truth, [because] as much as I love the underground, I don’t think it’s a place to live. [But] I think that, especially in large cities, where we have just a shortage of space everywhere we look, it’s making more and more sense to build down. In a lot of the east Asian megacities, you find crazy underground infrastructure. And [for] one of the amazing comments on this, there’s a writer, Rosalind Williams, who talks about how the underground environment as a living space is the culmination of our technological existence, meaning it’s a habitat which is completely unnatural, where every aspect of a given space is manufactured. We’re pumping in air. All the light is artificial. We’re creating sunrises and sunsets. We’re creating smells. Everything is manufactured.  And it’s a reality we’re already living in. Part of me thinks about that and is spooked because it’s sounds like a science-fiction narrative. But when I think about how so many people spend their lives, and how easy it is to go long periods of time without going out of your apartment or home, we might as well be living underground.  *Correction 1/29/2019: A previous version of this article featured a photo caption that incorrectly described an ochre mine as a cave.

738,738,01-08-16 23:00,2016,8,1,Javier Cabral,Meet the Sommelier Bro Who Is Trolling the Wine Industry,"If there is one community in the food and drink world that needs to take a chill pill every once in awhile, it's the wine world. And young people unaccustomed to the world of disposable income and leisurely dining out are more inclined to order a beer or cocktail than a bottle of wine, often thanks to how overwhelming the ordering process can be. This is where Adam Vourvoulis, a.k.a. @naturalwhine, comes in.  For the past year, he's been trolling the hell out of the wine industry with a very simple formula: memes that expose the elitism surrounding certain wines every day. Some memes are more clever than others but there is no denying that his trolliness is challenging the established norms of wine industry.  If Vourvoulis's name sounds familiar, it is because he is one-half of the dynamic duo that created the world's first wine rave and hashtag-ridden wine menu, the latter of which catapulted him into becoming one of the most loathed individuals in the American restaurant world. While it may be easy to just dismiss him as another troll on the interwebs, his pretense-free wine attitude is definitely resonating with other wine-loving Millennials. He has worked in some of Los Angeles's most prestigious restaurants—including Osteria Mozza, Ink, and Trois Mec—so the man knows his wines. We caught up with Vourvoulis to find more about his wine memes and whe hopes to accomplish with them.  OMG. Who made this?!? #sommlife MUNCHIES: Why do you hate the wine industry so much? Adam Vourvoulis: I wouldn't say I hate it. I just think we've been doing it all wrong. I think we could do it better. I'm in the punk-rock-meets-Backstreet-Boys school of the wine industry. I think it lost its way and turned into luxury when that's not what it is really about.] What is the wine industry about then?  First and foremost, it is all about fun. It's alcohol. The process of making wine is simple: Get grapes, put them in a container, wait a few weeks, and then bam! You've got wine. Now, is this great wine? Will this wine be the one that will win awards? That is in the eye of the beholder. Wine is deeper than all of this. It is about a sense of place and being around people and celebration. It's not about bragging and showing off online. It's not about unicorn wines. It's not about expensive Champagne.  Fetishizing wine in any way is the problem—even cheap stuff. I guess I am just starting a campaign of sorts. Instead of spending $100 or more on a bottle of wine, spend $50 and use the rest of the money for a charity, please. But wouldn't that hurt your job as a wine director for a premium restaurant?  Almost all of the wines at the place I work at are under $100. I want people to learn that buying two bottles of $50 wine is way better than one bottle of $100. Just think about where your money is going. Also, I'm lucky that the restaurant in LA I currently work at is owned and operated by mostly young people who understand and support my posts. You describe yourself as a ""wine activist"" on your Instagram account's bio. What exactly does that mean?  Part of it is tongue-in-cheek. Think about it: The concept of a ""wine activist"" is a little bit ridiculous. I'm just trying to inform a group of people who think of wine as being this elitist thing that there is much more out there to explore in wine. I don't think it is possible to completely take the pretentiousness out of wine. That is like saying, ""I want to take the pretentiousness out of collecting Rolexes."" I just want to make a social commentary on it, even though I am getting a shit-ton of hate for it. And I've dedicated my life to it... #sommlife What initially sparked @natural_whine? I would say this was the natural evolution of the wine rave. My social consciousness got the best of me and while riding LA's public transit to work, I realized that I was part of the wine problem. Obviously you spend a lot of time on your phone on the bus in LA; thus I started making memes to entertain myself. If I had to choose between giving up on memes or wine, I would choose wines. I've been doing this for a year, but I had remained anonymous until recently. One day, I just said ""fuck it!"" and put myself out there. Surprisingly, there are enough people out there who have similar ideologies with me. What has the feedback been like so far? Whenever I run into other wine industry people in real life, they support me and tell me, ""Keep doing what you're doing!"" But they whisper it to me because obviously a lot of people are in this business to make money, and they are afraid of their support ultimately affecting their bottom lines. Just the other day, I heard that people were talking about my memes for half an hour during a dinner among industry people.  What is your goal with @natural_whine? To really change the conversation and change the idea of what wine is to the consumer. Wine is not just for a certain demographic of people; wine is for everyone. No one should be excluded from this conversation just because you've never had wine before, or because you think a certain style is better than another style. It should always be inclusive rather than exclusive. Champagne is just wine. Marketing has made it what it is today—the marketing of luxury and exclusivity. No more exploitation in wine.

739,739,19-12-16 00:32,2016,12,19,April Glaser,Here’s a robotic hand that handles objects as delicately as a human ,"Scientists at Cornell University’s Organic Robotics Lab have developed a robotic hand that has a level of sensitivity that approaches a human’s — it’s sensitive enough to detect the shape, softness and overall texture of what it touches The silicone hand — developed by a team of roboticists led by Robert Shepherd, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Cornell — is filled with optical fibers that can detect how light that passes through the hand changes as it moves and comes into contact with other objects. Watch the soft robot pick the ripest out of three tomatoes, in various stages of maturity, just by touching them. Unlike most tactile robots that feel with sensors on the outside of the machine, this robotic hand has its sensors on the inside, more similar to a human. Typically, robots that sense what they touch rely on the object being able to conduct electricity, which the robot could then detect to try to learn things about what it’s touching. The hand made by the Cornell lab only works when the machine moves and changes shape. “If no light was lost when we bend the prosthesis, we wouldn’t get any information about the state of the sensor,” Shepherd said in an interview with the Cornell Chronicle. “The amount of loss is dependent on how it’s bent.” The Cornell researchers say this technology may one day power prosthetic hands that restore people’s sense of touch, or could give biologically inspired robots a more delicate and sensitive style of physical contact. Huichan Zhao, the Cornell doctoral candidate who is the lead author on the research on the soft robo-hand published in the Science Robotics journal this month, told NPR that she estimates that her team’s soft robotic hand could be made for as cheap as $50. But, as with other soft-robot projects, the hand from the Cornell lab needs to be filled with compressed air to cause the fingers to balloon, bend and hold their shape. And right now, air pumps are generally too big for a person to comfortably wear.

Green fired four birdies in an otherwise flawless round for a four-under-par 68 on a wet and windy day in Chaska, Minnesota to earn her first career lead at a major tournament.   South Korean Kim Hyo-joo made the early running at the Hazeltine National Golf Club with four birdies and a bogey in her 69 but that was only good enough for a share of second place with England’s Melissa Reid.   Another three South Koreans were among six players tied for fourth after shooting 70s, including defending champion Park Sung-hyun who stumbled to a double bogey at the par-four 14th in an otherwise solid round.   The tough weather conditions played havoc on scorecards with only 16 of the 154 players in the field going under par for the day.   Among those struggling was world number one Ko Jin-young of South Korea who carded five bogeys and in a round of 77 to sit at five-over par in a tie for 102nd.   Inbee Park, who won the tournament three consecutive years from 2013-15, and American Lexi Thompson, who has three consecutive top-two finishes including a one-stroke victory at the ShopRite LPGA Classic, both finished with par 72s.  Canadian Brooke Henderson, fresh off her ninth LPGA Tour victory at the Meijer LPGA Classic on Sunday, was unable to build off the momentum as she struggled to a four-over 76.  Michelle Wie, back in action after a two-month layoff dealing with a lingering wrist injury, endured a dismal return to competition in a round that included a quadruple-bogey, two double-bogeys, six bogeys and two birdies.  The former U.S. Women’s Open champion, who has endured a start-stop return to competitive golf after hand surgery last October, hit just six of 14 fairways and 10 of 18 greens in regulation while needing 35 putts to complete her round.  “It’s hard,” the tearful 29-year-old said.  “It’s just one of those situations where I’m not, you know, I’m not entirely sure how much more I have left in me, so even on the bad days, I’m just, like, trying to take time to enjoy it,” said the five-time winner on the LPGA Tour.  “But it’s tough.”  Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto and Rory Carroll in Los Angeles, editing by Ed Osmond",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-pgachamp-kim/green-grabs-first-round-lead-at-womens-pga-championship-idUSKCN1TL2TQ,Sports News,Reuters

743,743,24-09-18 22:24,2018,9,24,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,Fall TV: why we’re not doing a fall TV preview,"Technically, a new fall TV season begins today, Monday, September 24. Technically. I mean, did you even notice? There was a time when the start of a new TV season would bring with it endless pomp and circumstance. The Emmys would air the night before the season started, to reward the best of the past season. The networks would air preview specials in the weeks leading up to the new season, showing off the best moments from their new shows. You would be all but unable to escape the endless onslaught of advertising for those new shows, and the TV Guide would be the thickest, chunkiest issue of the year. And that’s to say nothing of the on-network promos that gathered up all the biggest stars to sing and dance to some cheesy pop knockoff (or, in the case of the WB, brood beautifully to the tune of This Way’s “Crawl”). But we’re living through an era when almost all of that is disappearing. As with summer movie season, “fall TV season” increasingly feels like an anachronism, a way to mark the passage of the entertainment year that has been drowned out by a glut of programming. How can it be fall TV season when it’s always fall TV season? Okay, yes, technically, there are still a few months where it doesn’t feel like 500 new shows debut every week. After Thanksgiving, basically no shows launch, due to the end-of-year slump in programming (though Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have all experimented with launching shows in this window), and August is still relatively quiet, though that, too, is changing. But the age of “fall TV season” — roughly September and October — and “midseason” (which sort of loosely comprised the January through March window) is essentially done for. Yes, lots of shows still launch in those windows, but we’ve also got a new “prestige TV” season (March through May), and there are so many more summer shows launching in June and July, and January is more crowded than ever, and ... and... Fall TV is still important for broadcast network shows, and ABC, CBS, the CW, Fox, and NBC will be launching 20 new series before the end of October. That’s not nothing. But where all but a handful of cable networks and streaming service programs used to stay away from the fall glut, now there are even more of them adding to the pile-up. FX launched its Sons of Anarchy spinoff Mayans MC in early September, HBO has its new Jennifer Garner vehicle Camping in October, and all three major streaming services have multiple programs debuting in these two months. And I haven’t even mentioned returning shows. Now, the argument here might be, “So fall TV season hasn’t disappeared. It’s just gotten worse.” I suppose that’s technically true, but only because there’s so much more television (more than 500 scripted shows, almost certainly) that everything has gotten worse. When Netflix is dedicated to launching a new show, or a new season of a show, on every weekend but a couple of holiday weekends, it’s hard to single out “fall” as a particularly important part of the TV calendar. This doesn’t mean we should completely abandon the other aspects of what fall TV season used to stand for — and, indeed, we here at Vox are going to be running weekly programming guides for you to make sense of the giant glut of new shows coming at you between now and Thanksgiving (when that glut mercifully calms down a bit). But the idea of fall as sink-or-swim time for new TV shows is increasingly antiquated. So why do we still cling to it like an essential part of the calendar? The whole reason we have a fall TV season in the first place largely stems from advertising. In particular, car manufacturers liked having new shows to place commercials on in the fall because it allowed them to advertise the new models as they began to hit car lots in the last three months of the year. (This is still true.) But ad-supported TV is a slowly dying model. It’s not like it’s going to completely disappear in the next few years (or even the next decade), but the focus of the TV industry is less and less on the ways that advertisers can make or break the bottom line. Indeed, if a network launches a new series in the fall, and it struggles to find an audience, there are many more arguments for sticking with that series than there used to be, especially if a network owns that show and can sell it overseas or to streaming services. (I’ve written a lot more about this slow, steady downward trend in cancellation.) So, then, why take a show that your network believes in and leave it to struggle for attention in the fall, when it might be better served launching somewhere else on the calendar? This has led to the very strange phenomenon of networks holding shows they clearly believe are their prestige players for midseason, while burning off more rote programs in the fall. There are exceptions, of course — NBC launched This Is Us in the fall and seems to be really into its (not that great) mystery drama Manifest and (perfectly adequate) medical drama New Amsterdam this year. But fall TV means less and less for networks in terms of quality, as well as in terms of their bottom lines. And for streaming services and cable networks, the economic incentive is to just keep producing and producing shows. Volume is the way to keep making money if you’re Netflix, because every show you produce might become the favorite of just enough subscribers that they keep paying for subscriptions. And if you launch all of those episodes at once, as Netflix does, well, you need dozens upon dozens of shows in production, and you need to scatter them all across the calendar. This is less true for services like Hulu, which release some shows weekly, but even those are ramping up production to better fill out the year. What’s more, the sheer number of shows on the broadcast networks launching in the fall window (the one thing still notably different about this part of the calendar) is down from where it was just 10 years ago. In the 2000s, it wasn’t rare for the number of new shows on broadcast to flirt with 30; in the past few seasons, it’s been rare for that number to go over 20. (And, really, my 20 count above is a lie, since it includes the not-actually-new Murphy Brown and only sort of new Roseanne spinoff The Conners.) Will fall TV continue to be important in the future? The answer is yes, but a qualified yes. In the sense that it marks a busy point in the TV calendar, sure, it’s worth paying attention to. But when the entire TV calendar is filled with new shows, when every week feels like the fall TV seasons of yore, the importance of fall premiere week every late September wanes. It’s not fall TV — it’s all TV.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/24/17885202/fall-tv-shows-best-new-preview,,Vox

745,745,30-08-16 16:41,2016,8,30,Will Magee,The Cult: Ricky Ponting,"This article originally appeared on VICE Sports UK. When Ricky Ponting walked to the wicket on the third day at Trent Bridge, he could not have fathomed what was about to happen. He might have envisaged his first few strokes, he might have dreamed of turning the tide against England, but there was no way he could have predicted just how important his innings would turn out to be. It was the Fourth Test of the 2005 Ashes, a series which was already shaping up to be one of the greatest of all time. He was about to make an error which would define the game, and react in a manner which would seal his place as England's ultimate cricketing antagonist. For almost two hours, Ponting looked like he might repeat his heroics in the Third Test. Then, when Australia had needed him most, he put in a Man of the Match performance and salvaged a draw for his struggling side. His seven-hour, 156-run innings at Old Trafford had seriously dented England's momentum, and stopped them from taking a 2-1 lead in the series with two Tests left to play. Afterwards, Mike Atherton told him: ""You're probably the most unpopular man in England right now."" Now, in the Fourth Test, Australia needed another heroic intervention from Ponting. The visitors' first innings had been borderline disastrous, with England's bowlers tearing through their batting order and leaving them 259 runs behind. In a bold move from England captain Michael Vaughan, Australia were given a humiliating slap in the face. The top team in Test cricket, the undisputed masters of the sport, were asked to follow-on for the first time in 17 years and 190 Tests. Ponting and his teammates were not best pleased. It showed in their response, which was to grit their teeth and battle their way to within 37 runs of England's total by evening. It was then, in the evening session, that the unfathomable happened. Ponting had put 48 runs on the scoreboard, having faced a mere 89 balls. He looked to be on his way to another tenacious top-order innings, and to frustrating England's bowlers once again. Suddenly, he was in terrible peril. Suddenly, he was in a losing footrace with a hurtling, arrowing, hard-flung ball. With the towering Freddie Flintoff bowling, Ponting's batting partner Damien Martyn nudged a delivery into the offside. Emboldened by the presence of his captain, he called Ponting out for a precarious single. In Martyn's mind it was good, aggressive batting, but in reality he had put Ponting in danger. Australia's would-be saviour set off, sprinting with all his might for the line. In those endless few moments, a little-known substitute had gathered up the ball. He went by the name of Gary Pratt, and was about to live out the highlight of his career. Seeing Ponting dashing for his life, he leapt into action. He threw straight for the wicket, and smashed the bails from the stumps while Ponting was still an outstretched bat from the refuge of the crease. Ponting's emotions in the aftermath of his run out came in three distinct stages. In the split second after he'd seen his bails go flying, there was ice-cold shock. When he turned to see who had thrown the fatal ball, there was a creeping sense of confusion and anger. Then, as he left the field, there was boiling, bubbling fury, inspired by the fact that he had not a fucking clue who his vanquisher was. Gary Pratt was not an England regular, see. He wasn't even a regular at county level, and had failed to make a single first-class appearance that year. Of all the protagonists of the 2005 Ashes series, he was one of the most minor. He was nothing more than a substitute fielder and, as far as Ponting was concerned, he shouldn't even have been on the pitch. Ponting's grievance stemmed from the fact that, prior to the start of the series, Australia had identified a pattern in England's use of substitutes. Their opponents had, for the past few months, been using substitute fielders not only as replacements for injured players, but also as tactical pawns. Temporary substitutions for the likes of Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Flintoff and so on would give England's bowlers a chance to rest up, consult with their coaches and refresh themselves at convenient points, before they returned to the field and resumed their duties. While there was no rule against this, Ponting and his teammates saw it as an infringement on the spirit of the game. Before the First Test, he had gone as far as to mention his concerns to the match referee. When he saw that he had been run out by an unfamiliar substitute, Ponting lost it. He directed a barrage of abuse at those nearest to him, before trudging up to the pavilion, muttering under his breath. When he arrived, he caught sight of England coach Duncan Fletcher on the balcony. In an outburst that some might argue was itself 'not cricket', he fired off a verbal volley of obscenities that left the nearest spectators looking, well, a bit traumatised. This was not an edifying moment for Ponting. Already unpopular for his thorny air of superiority when it came to England – not to mention his relentless batting displays – he would be fined 75% of his match fee for his paroxysm of rage. More importantly, his anger in this case was anything but righteous. Gary Pratt had, in fact, been on the field in the place of Simon Jones, who had been taken to hospital with an ankle injury which would end his participation in Test cricket for good. While England's use of substitutes may have been controversial, in this case the swap was necessary and entirely legitimate. Even when he looks back on that run out, Ponting rarely admits that he was wrong about Pratt's presence. Australia's talisman had been an antagonist to England before, but this took him to another level. He was roundly booed for the rest of the series, which England went on to win for the first time since the late eighties. The turning point was their narrow victory in the Fourth Test, which could have been so different without the contribution of Gary Pratt. Before the 2005 Ashes series began, Ponting did at least show a certain wariness of England. Having held the treasured urn for 18 consecutive years at that point, Australia's cricketing community was still largely dismissive. Fast bowler and fellow antagonist Glenn McGrath suggested that the series could be a whitewash in the months leading up to the contest, while most Australian pundits were confident of victory. Ponting struck a more measured note, however, admitting in a pre-series press conference that ""England have a bit of a winning habit and winning culture, which they haven't had for a while."" When it came to damning with faint praise, nobody did it better than Ponting. England had been resurgent in the years previous, rising from fifth place in the world rankings to a very respectable second. For Ponting, that represented ""a bit of a winning habit"" which, lest anyone forget, England had been lacking for well over a decade and a half. Nobody could have mistaken his tone of condescension, even in what was ostensibly a compliment. The thing is, much like the rest of his countrymen, Ponting was not quite wary enough. He could nod to the idea of England's improvement, but he couldn't bring himself to face the uncomfortable truth. Duncan Fletcher's side were now ready to rival the old enemy, and the balance of cricketing power had subtly shifted. The era of crushing Australian dominance was over, and there was more than ""a bit of a winning habit"" about their foes. Though Ponting's snarling exit from the Fourth Test sealed his status as the villain of the piece, there had been bad blood between him and the England team since long before he was run out by Gary Pratt. Here was a man who had so often frustrated his opponents at the crease, captaining his first series on English soil. Ponting had played a vital role in Australia's 4-1 triumph in the 2002/03 series, racking up several centuries as Nasser Hussain's side were taken to pieces in the Land Down Under. He was cool, collected and unflinchingly combative, while his sledging was known to be as snide as it was fierce. If Ponting needed a reminder of his opponents' resentment, it came from the arm of Steve Harmison in the First Test. England were pumped up for the occasion after months and months of Australian mind games and – despite the fact that they would go on to lose the series opener – their aggressive approach marked a change in attitude. England were ready to make things personal, an approach which Ponting had never had a problem with. That's where Harmison stepped in, and gave his opponent something to think about. Harmison started the Test in bellicose fashion, hitting Justin Langer with a nasty bouncer on the elbow early on. The Australians were somewhat shaken, until Ponting came in to steady the line. When Harmison spotted their captain coming out to bat, he felt the fire of acrimony burning in his belly. Not long after he'd taken his place at the wicket, Harmison smashed Ponting on the helmet with a wicked bouncer, which left a bright red gash on his cheek. While Harmison had gone too far in his belligerence, Ponting had been reminded of what England thought of him in no uncertain terms.

746,746,26-03-19 00:00,2019,3,26,Andrew Chung,U.S. top court backs Sudan over American sailors in USS Cole bombing case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday prevented American sailors injured in the deadly 2000 al Qaeda bombing of the Navy destroyer USS Cole from collecting $314.7 million in damages from the government of Sudan for its alleged role in the attack.   In a 8-1 ruling, the justices overturned a lower court’s decision that had allowed the sailors to collect the damages from certain banks that held Sudanese assets. The decision represented a major victory for Sudan, which denies that it provided any support to al Qaeda for the attack in Yemen.   Sudan was backed by President Donald Trump’s administration in the case.   In the ruling, the justices agreed with Sudan that the lawsuit had not been properly initiated in violation of U.S. law because the claims were delivered in 2010 to the African country’s embassy in Washington rather than to its minister of foreign affairs in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.   “Sudan is pleased with the decision,” said Christopher Curran, who represented Sudan’s government in the case. “No one disputes that the sailors on the Cole were the victims of a brutal terrorist attack. But Sudan vehemently disputes any culpability in that attack, and is determined to clear its name.”  A lawyer for the sailors, Kannon Shanmugam, expressed disappointment. “The fight for justice for the Cole victims and their families continues,” Shanmugam said.  A lower court had levied damages by default because Sudan did not defend itself against allegations that it had given support to the Islamist militant group.  The Oct. 12, 2000, attack killed 17 sailors and wounded more than three dozen others when two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the Navy guided-missile destroyer as it was refueling in the southern Yemeni port of Aden, blasting a gaping hole in its hull. The vessel was repaired and later returned to full active duty.  Fifteen of the injured sailors and three of their spouses sued Sudan’s government in 2010 in Washington. At issue was whether mailing the lawsuit to Sudan’s embassy violated the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, a U.S. law governing when foreign governments may be sued in American courts.  Writing for the court’s majority, conservative Justice Samuel Alito said that other countries’ foreign ministers must be reached where they normally work, “not a far flung outpost that the minister may at most occasionally visit.”  Alito expressed sympathy toward the sailors, writing that the ruling may seem like it is enforcing an empty formality.  “But there are circumstances in which the rule of law demands adherence to strict requirements even when the equities of a particular case may seem to point in the opposite direction,” Alito said, adding that the case had sensitive diplomatic implications.  Alone in his dissent, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas said that allowing litigants to send notices of lawsuits to embassies would comply with both U.S. and international law.  The Trump administration had told the justices that a ruling against Sudan could impact how the U.S. government is treated by foreign courts because the United States rejects judicial notices delivered to its embassies.   The sailors were highly critical of the administration’s position. “Particularly given this administration’s solicitude for veterans, its decision to side with a state sponsor of terrorism, against men and women who are seeking to recover for grievous injuries suffered in the service of our country, is inexplicable and distressing,” they said in a legal brief to the court.   In 2012, a federal judge in Washington issued a default judgment of $314.7 million against Sudan. Individual plaintiffs were to receive between $4 million and $30 million each.   A separate judge in New York later ordered certain banks to turn over assets they had held for Sudan to partially satisfy the judgment. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld those orders in 2015.

747,747,21-12-17 16:50,2017,12,21,Alissa Wilkinson,"Downsizing review: Matt Damon stars in an audacious, uneven sci-fi fable","Vox's guide to the year’s most essential films, from the Toronto International Film Festival to the Academy Awards. The premise of Downsizing is a great one: Scientists in Norway come up with the technology to reduce humans safely and efficiently down to about the size of your thumb. Small people, the thinking goes, generate less waste, consume fewer resources, and take up less space than their full-sized counterparts. On an overpopulated planet that’s becoming overrun with waste, more and more expensive, and gradually less inhabitable, downsizing could be what saves everyone. The unintended consequences will quickly present themselves to the average viewer: What happens if everyone shrinks down in a world that is still very much full-sized? Doesn’t a world overrun by, say, regular-sized house pets become Jurassic Park? Wouldn’t the economic benefits eventually disappear? But Downsizing is science fiction, a genre in which the concepts are often great but the corresponding stories often have to wave their hands around a bit to keep you from seeing the plot holes. In this case, the hand-waving comes by way of a long, meandering story that seems to take a sharp left turn in several spots. By the end of Downsizing you can barely remember where you began. I’m not convinced that’s a strike against the movie. It seems to be imitating the journey of its protagonist, Paul Safranek (Matt Damon), who is a blandly friendly fellow on the road to self-discovery. Downsizing — directed by Alexander Payne (Nebraska, Sideways) from a screenplay he wrote with frequent collaborator Jim Taylor — likely would have benefited from a bit more vision and control, some more streamlined shifts in focus. But its unwieldy, occasionally baffling progression has a charm all its own. After the Norwegian scientists invent the shrinking technology, a pilot group of 36 people bravely shrink themselves and live successfully in a colony for a few years, and then their existence is announced to the public. As with many socially conscious endeavors in more affluent parts of the world, downsizing carries benefits for the planet as a whole, but more benefits for the people who actually downsize. For one thing, there’s a kind of status that comes along with the process, signaling that everyone who participates is brave, a pioneer, an adventurer. But the biggest, most immediate benefit to those who downsize has to do with how much more inexpensive it is to live in the small world. Their full-sized assets, once liquidated, make them wealthier than they’d ever been in the real world. People who once were barely getting by in a small home now can afford a big, stylish McMansion in a gated community called Leisureland; “small-only” and corporate-owned, the place has zero crime and there’s plenty of time for pleasurable pursuits. Not everyone jumps at the opportunity — some people are too poor to even afford the downsizing, some have medical issues (such as replacement hips) that make it impossible, and some just don’t want to make such a drastic change to their bodies and lives. But for those who can, it seems like an exciting, viable thing to do. Choosing to downsize is essentially like hitting the reset button, and it’s something that Paul and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) start looking into after two of their high school classmates (Jason Sudeikis and Maribeth Monroe) turn up small at a reunion. It’s a way of shedding your mortgage, your dead-end job, and your old life, and to start out fresh in a community of people who are just like you. Things do not go as planned. Through a series of unfortunate events, Paul finds himself living in a Leisureland one-bedroom apartment below a loud neighbor named Dusan (Christoph Waltz) and his buddy Konrad (Udo Kier), two international playboys who throw a lot of parties. At one of those parties, Paul meets a Vietnamese refugee named Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau) who stowed away in a TV after being shrunk against her will in a prison for dissidents. (Turns out authoritarian governments have their own ideas about how to use the shrinking technology.) Paul becomes fascinated with Ngoc Lan, who lives outside the wall of Leisureland in a tenement-style building that’s home to a lot of immigrants and poor small people. (The metaphors in Downsizing are not particularly subtle.) Ngoc Lan spends her time doing all kinds of things, but especially making sure that the old, sick, and hungry among her neighbors get some kind of care, as best she can. She represents something Paul hasn’t experienced in a long time: passion and drive, and a sense of responsibility. But then one day, both Dusan and Ngoc Lan get calls from the man who invented downsizing. He wants them to come see him in Norway. Paul, who’s fallen pretty hard for Ngoc Lan, tags along, and what the trio discovers there is that the act of downsizing itself, corporate-style, isn’t the solution to what ails the planet. And they’re offered another way to save themselves from the coming apocalypse. Downsizing is among several movies this year that posit the apocalypse in the form of imminent environmental catastrophe (Mother! is another, if Darren Aronofsky is to believed). It is, then, a kind of pre-apocalyptic movie crossed with science fiction, and on that level it succeeds out of sheer weirdness. The fun of this kind of story is in the world-building, and though the world that Downsizing starts with is, ahem, small, it telescopes outward over the course of the film. Along with Paul, we slowly take in the various consequences and repercussions of the downsizing effort. If you can settle in and just go with it, there’s pleasure in watching the whole thing unfold. At its best, it does what stories like this should do: present various social issues like — overconsumption, bias, willful blindness to the world’s problems — in a new context, so that we see them afresh. Downsizing isn’t perfect, though, and while it seems at times like the film is making a feint toward satire, it never really gets there. There are a lot of ideas in the mix, but the film lacks the follow-through to give it real punch. Since Downsizing’s festival run, there’s been criticism of Chau’s character, who has a heavy accent that is played (quite a lot) for laughs. (More generally, Payne has been criticized in the past by those who feel his movies are condescending toward their characters.) Perhaps more disappointing, however, is that Paul, played by Damon (who has been repeatedly shoving his foot into his mouth during the press tour for the film), is just not a terribly compelling or interesting person. That’s part of the idea, of course — his main trait is passivity — but it doesn’t make for a very good protagonist, especially next to Chau’s character, who is a pragmatic spitfire, and Waltz’s, who is an unmitigated weirdo. I can’t exactly recommend Downsizing. It’s hard to say whether it’s successful in its aims, since it’s not entirely clear what those aims are. But while I watched, I found myself thinking about Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her, which is similarly set in the very near future and posits another kind of apocalypse, one that’s specifically linked to our over-reliance on technology. Jonze was more successful in showing how our humanity is what binds us together, and what really comprises that humanity; I think that’s what Payne was after in Downsizing, too. He succeeds only in fits and starts. But in the end, I have to admire him for attempting at all.

751,751,09-11-16 07:36,2016,11,9,Matthew Yglesias,Media obsession with a bullshit email scandal helped Trump to the White House,"The media’s coverage of the 2016 race didn’t win the election for Donald Trump, but it didn’t help. Back in September, Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that, in retrospect, ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press. What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates. The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular. The way Frank Newport, Lisa Singh, Stuart Soroka, Michael Traugott, and Andrew Dugan put it for Gallup is that compared with the email-centric view of Clinton, “Americans' reports of what they have read, seen or heard about Donald Trump over this same period have been more varied and related to his campaign activities and statements.” Journalists are accustomed to thinking of the media primarily in terms of the inputs we deliver to public understanding of major events. To thinking, in other words, of what stories we publish. And by that standard, the overwhelming conventional wisdom among journalists has been that we, as a profession, held Donald Trump’s feet to the fire. Major media outlets have, after all, done reports on all of the following: One could further emphasize the point by adding to the list. But any reasonable person would judge that there has been no shortage of negative coverage of Trump. A strikingly wide range of character weaknesses have been probed and exposed in the mainstream press. Clinton has, by contrast, mainly been subjected to two negative storylines. One concerns the question of whether she gave favorable access to donors to the Clinton Foundation, and the other concerns the propriety of her decision to use a private email server to conduct business while serving as secretary of state. The problem is that if you think of campaign journalism as not just a series of stories but a collective effort to produce public understanding as an output, then we have failed. You see it right there in the Gallup graphic. People heard loud and clear that Clinton was in some kind of trouble related to email whereas the stories about Trump — with the exception of the sexual assault allegations, which came after this study — do not seem to have broken through. Indeed, there’s the alarming possibility that Trump actually benefited from the sheer range of negative stories about him. To cover any one Trump story — his refusal to disclose his income taxes or to commit to putting his business holdings in a blind trust — as extensively as the Clinton email story was covered would have necessarily required that less attention be paid to other important lines of inquiry into Trump. But by trying to cover all the different negative storylines about Trump, the press created a muddle in which nothing in particular stood out. Conversely, the fact that there actually weren’t very many negative angles to pursue against Clinton ended up blowing the email story out of proportion. If you have journalists assigned to cover Clinton, they need to do some kind of stories. And they’re going to want to do some tough stories. So if the only topic to do tough stories about is emails, you’re doing to get a lot of stories about emails. And a natural implication that people are going to draw is that Clinton’s email server is a crucially important story. The truth, however, is that the email saga was profoundly unimportant. Federal IT at the time would have required her to carry two separate BlackBerrys, one for her personal email and one for her work email. That’s what an ordinary State Department employee would have had to do, but Clinton was the boss, so she chose to exempt herself from the rule and just use one email account. It was a little selfish (a perfect boss would have played by the rules while insisting on finding a department-wide solution to the problem) but not especially important. Most of all, it wasn’t criminal, and it didn’t endanger national security. Indeed, the use of a private email system has nothing to do with the inquiry into the emailing of classified material that it spawned. Government personnel aren’t supposed to discuss classified matters on non-secure channels like email at all. And as a rule, they don’t. But it happens from time to time accidentally and it’s not a crime. The truth, however, is that the email server scandal is and always was overhyped bullshit. Clinton broke no laws, as the FBI concluded twice. But beyond that, basic familiarity with the relevant law would have made it clear to anyone that no FBI investigation of the matter was even vaguely likely to conclude that she had. For starters, the bulk of statutes related to classification require some form of intent to establish criminality. The exception is 18 USC § 793, an 18th-century statute whose text sets a lower “gross negligence” standard. If that was all you knew, then the inclusion of classified information in email exchanges that Clinton conducted on a non-secure system might sound like it fits the bill. But experts uniformly say otherwise. As Jack Goldsmith, one of the top lawyers in George W. Bush’s administration, explains, such a prosecution “would be entirely novel, and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind.” Ben Wittes, a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law, wrote that James omey’s characterization was clearly correct: For the last several months, people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were. I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind. People simply don't get indicted for accidental, non-malicious mishandling of classified material. I have followed leak cases for a very long time, both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare. I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information. Hillary Clinton is not above the law, but to indict her on these facts, she'd have to be significantly below the law. It’s true that to a layman the Espionage Act’s reference to “gross negligence” sounds similar to Comey’s characterization of Clinton’s actions as “extremely careless.” But as Philip Zelikow, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, explains, they only sound alike “unless you do a tiny bit of homework” on the history and case law of the statute. Did Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails? Philip Zelikow walks you through. #election2016 @AnnCompton @pastpunditrypic.twitter.com/kS8Z4dq9Qf — Miller Center (@Miller_Center) November 3, 2016 As the Cato Institute’s Julian Sanchez writes, attempting a prosecution for non-malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional: “the Supreme Court’s opinion in Gorin v. United States (1941), which suggests that the Espionage Act’s intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness.” This legal analysis is important because people who understood it would have understood that the “bombshell” revelation that more emails had been discovered on Anthony Weiner’s laptop was going to be a non-story. Even if for some reason the emails turned out to be new (and it now looks like they weren’t), there was absolutely zero reason to believe they would show the malign intent that you would need to demonstrate that Clinton broke the law. But by that point, email mania had become a locked-in story. The press had covered emails so much, and public perceptions of Clinton were so dominated by emails, that the mere hint of new email news itself became a meta-story. Neither the headlines nor the accompanying articles had much in the way of actual content — there was no information, after all — but they simply asserted the self-fulfilling prophecy that people talking about emails would jolt the race. Which, according to all the evidence, it did. The massive overweighting of emails in Americans’ news diet was not the only failing of journalism this cycle. As Jonathan Bernstein writes, press coverage did not really convey one of the most remarkable things about Trump — his profound lack of support from inside the Republican Party. Neither of the GOP’s former presidents supported him. A number of sitting United States senators declined to endorse him. So did a smattering of Republican governors from Tennessee and Ohio to Maryland. Only 5 percent of Republican state legislators explicitly endorsed Trump. This should have been presented to voters as what it was — a huge, anomalous situation; the political equivalent of flashing red warnings lights on the highway. But it was not. That was in part due to a lack of backbone on the part of many of the Trump-skeptical Republicans. But it was also in part a result of deliberate editorial strategies. CNN chose to sideline much of its regular stable of conservative pundits and replace them with professional Trump apologists. That let them stage their normal fair and balanced pundit roundtables rather than exposing the audience to the reality that the underlying situation was abnormal. That abnormality should have been the dominant theme of the election. As Ezra Klein wrote after the national conventions, “This campaign is not merely a choice between the Democratic and Republican parties, but between a normal political party and an abnormal one.” That Trump was not really normal was, I think, properly conveyed by the bulk of the coverage. But the impact of wall-to-wall email stories was to excessively abnormalize Clinton. Clinton is, fundamentally, a regular, center-left Democratic Party politician who’d be largely interchangeable with Amy Klobuchar or Chris Murphy or Kirsten Gillibrand or whoever else as president. One can reasonably criticize this whole group of politicians for being too liberal or for being too moderate or many other things. But they’re banal, just like Clinton. The impact of the email story was to exoticize and abnormalize Clinton in an entirely unwarranted way. To create the impression that the election pitted two abnormal characters against each other, when in truth nothing of the sort was going on. Analysis of Trump’s victory will naturally tend to focus on the broad structural forces that drove his rise. But elections are close-run things. The difference between a narrow win in Florida and a narrow loss in Florida is just a few thousand votes. The typical Trump supporter was drawn to him out of either baseline partisanship or attraction to the peculiarities of his message. But the marginal Trump supporter is the reason he won. And that supporter was very likely influenced by the overwhelming media focus on the email matter. Future historians will look back on this dangerous period in American politics and find themselves astonished that American journalism, as an institution, did so much to distort the stakes by elevating a fundamentally trivial issue.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/9/13570724/media-obsession-emails,,Vox

Lara Trump, President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and reelection campaign adviser, had a message for the furloughed workers and those working without pay: It will be worth it. “Listen, it’s not fair to you, and we all get this, but this is so much bigger than any one person,” she said in an interview with Bold TV. “It’s a little bit of pain, but it’s going to be for the future of our country.” Future Americans will be grateful for the shutdown, Trump said: “Their children and their grandchildren will thank them for their sacrifice right now.” Although she said she empathized with workers’ plights — “I know they have bills to pay, they have mortgages, they have rents that are due” — Trump’s comments sparked a backlash because of her personal wealth. Regardless, she said fixing immigration policy was more important: “He knows we need a wall — or a structure, however you want to talk about it,” she said of the president, adding that the “broken” immigration system needed these workers to be strong for their country. She then expressed gratitude to the workers who have been going without paychecks for more than a month.

Lara Trump claimed it’s “sad” Democrats don’t care enough about federal workers to come to the discussion table.

Aside from caving to Trump’s demands, it’s unclear what else Democrats can do at this point.

The ban would cover live pigs and carcasses in an effort to prevent the disease from spreading into Thailand, said a notice on the Thai Department of Development of Livestock on Friday.  The move follows a similar ban on Friday by China.  Laos on Thursday confirmed its first outbreaks of deadly African swine fever - which is fatal to pigs but does not harm humans - in its southern province of Saravane, the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health said on Thursday.  Lao authorities reported seven outbreaks of ASF in villages in Saravane, which led to the deaths of 973 animals, the OIE said on its website, citing information from Laos’ Agriculture Ministry.  Millions of pigs have been slaughtered in China, Hong Kong and Vietnam to try to stop the spread of the disease.

Levandowski was one of Google's top engineers who worked on the company's self-driving car technology, and was accused by Google of stealing sensitive, classified information he allegedly brought with him to Uber through the acquisition of Ottomotto, the startup he founded immediately after leaving the search giant. According to the WSJ report, months before his departure, Levandowski was working on a flying car project at Kitty Hawk, one of Larry Page's privately owned startups. He wasn't a formal Kitty Hawk employee, apparently, but he was allegedly testing prototype aircrafts with Page at one point. In the ongoing litigation between Google and Uber, which involves Page and Levandowski, Google's cofounder claimed that he tried to ward off Levandowski when it came to opening new businesses, especially if they were competing with his own work at Google. Levandowski was highly regarded among Google's top executives, the Journal says, and worked on side projects outside of the company. However, when Levandowski declared his interest in self-driving trucks — which were technically not part of his work at Google — this didn't sit well with Page. ""I told him very, very clearly that I thought that was highly competitive and not a good idea,"" said Page, according to the transcript of his deposition, released last Wednesday. ""I'm like, 'No, that's not fine. Like, that's the same thing as what you're doing here. I mean, you can do that, but we are not going to be happy.'""

758,758,26-08-16 14:35,2016,8,26,"Mike Pearl, VICE Staff",What Are Whip Its? The Side Effects and Dangers of Doing Them,"Time for ""How Scared Should I Be?"" the column that quantifies the scariness of everything under the sun, and teaches you how to allocate that most precious of natural resources: your fear. I know what you're thinking: Is there a conceivable universe where whippits—inhalations of nitrous oxide gas, typically sucked out of a whipped-cream can—are scary? Last week, when someone I know asked if it was a good idea to buy a huge box of whipped-cream chargers at a bargain basement price, all I could give him was a hunch: It seemed like it might not be a good idea to buy that many. I wasn't sure why. Here's what you already know: Nitrous oxide gas makes cream into whipped cream, makes Vin Diesel's car go faster, and makes dental work slightly less awful. And if you take a lungful of it for fun, you'll be like ""whoooooo..."" for about the time it takes to breathe in and out. That's the whole thing. It's not exactly heroin. Right? ""You can die using it in some circumstances,"" said Matthew Howard, social worker and editor of the Journal of Addictive Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Fortunately, he added, ""Most people are engaged in intermittent episodic use. That's not nearly as problematic."" To find out more about what kind of drug nitrous oxide is, I spoke to Kate Leslie, head of anesthesia research at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. She said it ""puts people to sleep, takes away pain, and it has euphoric effects."" She called the amount in a normal whipped-cream charger—three or four lungfuls—""a small-ish dose,"" but she also said it's ""about the same as we've used to put someone to sleep."" Here's a breakdown of how whippits can go wrong. And yes, they can go very wrong if you work hard enough at it. When it comes to casual use of nitrous oxide, one of the biggest dangers is probably that you'll ""become unconscious, collapse and hit your head, or break your arm or fall off something,"" Leslie said. If you do pass out, and someone calls 911, Leslie recommended that when the paramedics inevitably ask why you went unconscious, you just tell them ""whippits"" instead of going, ""Maybe I was hungry!"" You might end up being subjected to a lot of unnecessary tests if you lie. The legal consequences of confessing aren't exactly dire. Whippits aren't legal, but prosecutions are very tricky, and the paramedics can help you. ""They'll put you on oxygen,"" she said. And if you're short on vitamins from breathing too much nitrous oxide (more on that below), you can be ""topped up"" and on the road to recovery in no time. Another potential concern for casual users, Leslie said, is that ""nitrous oxide causes vomiting."" (While this is something she and others believe, lab experiments haven't really proven it conclusively.) Still, if you've ever done whippits, you know they can make you feel nauseous, so a little caution in this area is wise. ""You breathe in your vomit, and you choke to death. That's the way a lot of people die of drug overdose,"" Leslie said. So just like when you're super drunk, it's a good idea not to lie flat on your back if you've just been doing whippits. Nitrous oxide isn't oxygen, which is something you need in order to, y'know, stay alive. It's definitely a bad sign if your lips turn blue, but you probably won't die from oxygen deprivation by sucking on a whipped-cream can. It's worth noting, though, that Demi Moore ended up in hospital in 2012 after allegedly sucking on industrial grade whipped-cream chargers. From here, our definition of ""whippits"" starts to get expansive. Imagine for a moment, you love whippits so much, you make the decision to toss the whipped-cream cans altogether, and start buying your gas in larger quantities. ""The fatal cases usually involve wearing a mask,"" Howard told me. Generally, the way people die, he said, is that they ""kinda knew what they were doing and put on some kind of mask. ""When people pass out, they'll drop the balloon or whatever and start breathing air,"" Howard said. ""If you've got a gas mask on, you won't."" This is doubly true if you do what Andrew McCoy of Blacksburg, Virginia, did and put a bag on your head in order to get more nitrous oxide into your lungs. McCoy asphyxiated and died. So basically, stick to whipped-cream cans and balloons, and open a window. Whippits are usually something people do when a pool party starts getting weird, not a serious, sit-around-and-do-it-all-day drug. But according to Howard, there are people who can find themselves tempted to do whippits all day every day: those who work with big tanks of nitrous oxide and are prone to boredom. Medical side effects can set in, he said, from ""the kind of use you see among dentists, dental hygienists, and people who work in the food service industry."" What can happen to these folks is similar to what happened to patients in early intensive-care units: ""Patients developed a condition called Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,"" Leslie told me. This comes from a vitamin deficiency, and if you get an injection of vitamin B12 soon enough, it can go away. Otherwise, you can wind up with permanently stiff limbs, grogginess, weakness, and tingly hands. In 2012, a kid in north London inhaled some kind of gas from a balloon, mistakenly thinking it was nitrous oxide, and then died of a heart attack. An investigation by the Daily Mail revealed that what he'd actually inhaled was, horribly, some kind of comedy prop called a ""smelly balloon"" meant to stink up a room when popped. It contained butane, isobutane and pentane, all of which are toxic. And in the course of researching this topic, I noticed that it was common to conflate whippits with the use of other inhalants, including volatile solvents or spray duster. ""Those are really, super toxic,"" Howard told me when we briefly spoke on the subject. They deserve their own entry in this column, frankly. It was hard to take this topic seriously, because on one hand, if you're sucking nitrous out of a can every once in a while, you'll be fine. On the other hand, this evil gas of death somehow claimed 17 lives in the UK between 2006 and 2012. Conditions associated with long-term use of nitrous oxide like the aforementioned subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, as well as myeloneuropathy legitimately scary, but they're also very unusual. For God's sake just do it around people. Don't wear a mask. And just generally take it easy with that stuff.

Milk VR is Samsung’s play for virtual reality video content — and a key part of the hardware maker’s strategy to plant its flag in the emerging field. As smartphone sales have slowed, Samsung and other Android manufacturers have looked to VR for a new revenue stream. Milk VR is its platform built for 360-degree videos, which currently live inside its Gear VR headset, a partnership with Facebook’s Oculus. A spokesperson confirmed the departure and sent the following statement to Re/code: “Samsung remains committed to delivering engaging, connected entertainment experiences through our Milk platform, including Milk VR.” So Samsung claims it still cares about VR videos. But Apfel’s departure, regardless of the reason, doesn’t look great for Samsung’s entertainment and software strategy, a long handicap for the Korean conglomerate. The company already shut down Milk Video and is reportedly shutting down its Milk Music service, too. The perception in the VR industry is that Milk VR has been a relative bust. Part of the challenge is that Samsung has lots of competition from other video libraries like Oculus Video and YouTube and smaller, independent services like Littlestar and Vrideo. With its Oculus partnership, Samsung surrendered much of the content control to Facebook, according to a former Samsung employee. Apfel, a VP of creative content and strategy for Samsung, joined the company in 2014. He was previously the chief digital officer for the Core Media Group. Samsung doesn’t have a replacement for Apfel, but we will update this story if we hear anything new. In February, Samsung released the Gear 360, a consumer camera for capturing VR content that competes with offerings from Google and other startups. Additional reporting by Ina Fried.

The two had just taken a photograph together at a 2012 fundraiser in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her husband reportedly saw the gesture and stopped it by making a joke. Neither woman said anything publicly at the time, though Caruso said she squirmed in her seat to make it clear that she was uncomfortable. They did not classify what happened as sexual assault or harassment, and no one has accused Biden of such behavior.  But some believe Biden’s familial style of touching strangers and supporters, perhaps without permission, is out-of-touch in the wake of the #MeToo movement — and a potential political liability for the 76-year-old Democrat’s chances in the 2020 presidential election.  “He has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's space is important to them, and what's important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it,” House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi told Politico. But, Pelosi said, she doesn’t see the allegations against Biden as “disqualifying.” And over the last few days, many women who know Biden or who have worked with him have publicly said that Biden tries to use touch to convey kindness and support. But not everyone sees his behavior that way. On Friday, former Nevada state legislator Lucy Flores said that Biden gave her an unwanted kiss on the back of her head just minutes before the two went onstage at a 2014 rally. Three days later, on Monday, Amy Lappos, a Connecticut woman and former congressional aide, said that Biden rubbed noses with her, which she felt was inappropriate, when she encountered him at a 2009 fundraiser. Neither women spoke up publicly at the time. “I never filed a complaint, to be honest, because he was the vice president. I was a nobody,” Lappos told the Hartford Courant. “There’s absolutely a line of decency. There’s a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It’s not cultural. It’s not affection. It’s sexism or misogyny.” In a statement last weekend, after Flores came forward, Biden said he did not intend to act inappropriately and make anyone uncomfortable. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention,” he said. “I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.” Cover image: Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the Biden Courage Awards Tuesday, March 26, 2019, in New York.

762,762,15-11-18 14:20,2018,11,15,Kelsey Piper,"Midterm voters in Fargo, North Dakota, approved a new election system","Finding the best ways to do good. Made possible by The Rockefeller Foundation. There are a lot of different ways to hold a democratic vote. Experts think the system most Americans know best — called “first-past-the-post” — might be among the worst of them. Under our current system, you vote for one candidate; the candidate with the most support at the end of the day wins. So what’s wrong with that? Quite a lot, actually. First-past-the-post favors two-party systems. It makes it unnecessary to appeal to a broad share of the electorate in multi-candidate races. Voters often have to vote strategically — for the major party candidate they dislike least — rather than honestly — for the candidate they actually want. Last week, the voters of Fargo, North Dakota, decided to opt out of this way of electing people. They voted overwhelmingly — 64-36 — for a different voting system, one that has never been tried anywhere. It’s called approval voting, a system that allows you to vote for more than one candidate — basically, any of the candidates you approve of on the ballot. The move toward it is part of a growing interest in improving our democracy by changing the way we vote, toward methods that promote less polarization. Fargo elects its city commissioners. In 2015, there was a six-way race for one seat and the winning candidate won with 21.8 percent of the vote. That inspired members of the commission to wonder if that was really the output of a healthy democratic process. They created an election task force, and the election task force set to work looking at different options for conducting Fargo elections. They hit on approval voting. The resulting landslide vote in favor of the system — which goes into effect the next election cycle — suggests that voters are intrigued by the idea of improving our political processes. Fargo’s election task force reached out to the Center for Election Science, which researches better voting systems and works to get them put into practice. Aaron Hamlin, its executive director, told me of our first-past-the-post system: “It’s the worst voting method there is.” Because it forces a voter to vote strategically from a slate of candidates, it’s demoralizing for voters, and it likely contributes to the predominance of the two major American political parties. First-past-the-post is particularly badly equipped for elections like the one in Fargo, with six candidates running — a candidate who is loathed by most of the electorate can still win (though to be clear, this isn’t necessarily what happened in Fargo). First-past-the-post, Hamlin told me, “tends to split votes for moderates. ... It favors more polarized candidates. Third parties and independents often get an artificially low amount of support.” Of course, a moderate candidate isn’t necessarily a better one. But anyone who is poorly represented by the platform of either major party might be excited at the idea of more alternatives on their ballot. One of Hamlin’s favorite examples of the failures of first-past-the-post voting is the 1991 Louisiana gubernatorial election. There was a moderate candidate: widely liked Democratic incumbent Gov. Buddy Roemer. Among the other candidates were the notoriously corrupt Democrat Edwin Edwards, later sentenced to a decade in federal prison for racketeering, and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, a Republican. Roemer did overwhelmingly better than Edwards in head-to-head polling. Roemer also did overwhelmingly better than Duke in head-to-head polling. But he lost to both of them in the three-way open primary, so the general election was between a racketeer and a white supremacist — even though the electorate of Louisiana preferred Roemer over either of them, according to Hamlin. (Edwards eventually won, after a runoff election known for bumper stickers that said “Vote for the crook. It’s important.”) Approval voting seeks to avoid such scenarios. The system is exceptionally simple: You just vote for all the candidates you like. Say there are six candidates on the ballot and you happen to like three of them. Under approval voting, you mark all three on your ballot. Whoever nets the most approval votes win. “Approval voting allows you to always support your honest favorite,” Hamlin told me. “It seems simple, but it’s surprisingly hard to do.” In approval voting, you don’t have to vote strategically — you are never better off leaving your favorite off your ballot. The Center for Election Science has argued that approval voting is better than most other voting systems at electing a candidate who would beat all other candidates in a head-to-head match, if there is such a candidate. That might mean we’d elect more candidates who had broad favorability and fewer who appeal to a narrow base. In an election with more than two candidates, it matters a lot which voting system you’re using. One way it matters is the effects on third-party candidates. In ranked-choice and approval voting systems, you can express support for more than one person, which can be a good way for third-party candidates and independent candidates to get a toehold. That’s strongly disincentivized by first-past-the-post. There’s actually an entire field of study dedicated to ways of holding a democratic vote. No voting system is perfect across the board. No system is simple, fair, proportionate, incentivizes honest rather than strategic voting, and chooses the candidate voters want in every single election. But that doesn’t mean some systems aren’t much better, or much worse, than others. Approval voting is one such alternative. Another is something called ranked-choice voting. Ranked-choice voting, also known as instant-runoff voting, lets voters list their first, second, third, etc. choice of candidates. “You vote for whoever you want,” said Lee Drutman, senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a contributor to Polyarchy, an independent blog published on Vox and produced by the political reform program at New America. “And then you pick your second, third, and fourth choice, and when your top choice is eliminated, your vote gets transferred.” Ranked-choice voting has been put into use in municipal elections from Portland, Maine, to San Francisco, and in 2018 it was used in a congressional election for the first time, in Maine. (Maine is still figuring out who won.) Ranked-choice voting means that a third-party candidate is less likely to be a “spoiler.” It could allow more third-party candidates to run. It also means that candidates can form informal alliances — telling their supporters “vote for me first, and vote for this other candidate second.” Drutman thinks this might make vicious attack ads against your opponents less appealing as a strategy: “You need to get the other candidates to vote for you a little bit, to say, ‘Vote for me, but put them second,’ which encourages more civility.” Critics of ranked-choice voting complain that it doesn’t fully solve the problem of strategic voting. In a contested three-way race where all three candidates have a credible shot at winning, it can still make strategic sense to rank someone else above your favorite. Critics also worry that, while ranked-choice voting should in theory promote the growth of third parties, it doesn’t seem to have done that in the cities where it’s been implemented so far. But Drutman emphasized that ranked-choice voting has increased viewpoint diversity and ensured winners better reflect the cities they represent — it’s just that most cities are single-party in the US. All three of the candidates in San Francisco’s recent ranked-choice mayoral election were nominally Democrats — but they had genuine differences in ideology and worldview, and voters used the ranked-choice system to select a moderate. “Ranked-choice voting has been used for 100 years in Australia,” Drutman said, “A proportional form of it has been used in Ireland.” He is optimistic it will catch on here, too. Ranked-choice voting encourages voters to pick their first, second, third, etc. choice. That allows for more nuanced ballots, but it also makes for more complicated ballots. Some research has found that ranked-choice voting produces an unusually high rate of spoiled ballots. That might just be because voters aren’t used to ranked-choice voting. But it’s also inspired some cities to experiment with other voting systems. As for approval voting, some people worry that it might be frustrating or unclear for voters. “Approval voting just says, ‘I’m okay with all these people,’” Drutman says, “but it doesn’t allow you to say that you’d like one more than the rest.” It’s not clear how much voters will make use of their opportunity to vote for more than one candidate. But what Hamlin and Drutman both agree on is that the current system is plainly worse. “Any elections expert will tell you that it’s probably the worst voting system for broader representation,” Drutman told me, echoing Hamlin’s lament. Fargo decided to heed these critics’ calls. Their new election law will go into place the next time they go to the ballot box. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who served from 1916 to 1939, once said that the role of states in America was as “laboratories” of democracy. Each state, and each city, can try things that haven’t been tried before. Others can observe and copy the methods that are working the best. In that way, these small-scale experiments with obscure voting systems can grow into something that transforms American politics. Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

That milestone reflects both its recent momentum and also (in tech-speak) the strength of an incumbent like the Giving Pledge, which is expected to route close to $500 billion in commitments to philanthropy. Rivals to the Giving Pledge — including a separate effort spearheaded by Salesforce founder Marc Benioff — are, in ways, trying to both disrupt it and replicate it simultaneously. “They sort of made the market of pledges of this kind, and started challenging the wealthiest of the wealthy to do more than token philanthropy — to really put their name and reputation on the line,” David Goldberg, the head of Founders Pledge, said in an interview. “Founders Pledge is a way to hold their future selves to account.” To be clear, the Founders Pledge has not signed up brand names like Warren Buffett or Mark Zuckerberg. Its highest-profile commitments are from people like Miguel McKelvey, a cofounder of WeWork; Niklas Adalberth, the founder of Klarna; and Jose Neves, the founder of Farfetch. But it’s trying to appeal to a younger, less-endowed class of the aspiring rich — and focusing exclusively on tech. In fact, not only do you have to not be a billionaire to sign the Founders Pledge like you must with the Giving Pledge, you don’t even have to be a millionaire. Or even have a likely company exit. Or even have company revenue. Or anything, really. (Okay, you generally need to be the company’s founder.) All it asks is that you commit to a future gift. It’s a percentage of your profits — a minimum of 2 percent of your personal proceeds — which leaves open the possibility that you could be giving away hundreds of millions of dollars if you build a unicorn company or, more likely, a big fat zero. That also makes the effort much more accessible. About 1,500 people have signed the Founders Pledge — eight times the number who have signed the Giving Pledge — which has led to about $360 million in commitments that have been fulfilled, according to the organization. The big idea here: What if there were a way for today’s younger aspiring tech billionaires to publicly affirm their willingness to donate some of their personal fortunes — but to do so before they really have the money to make good on the promise? But the easiest-to-convince pledgers signed up, as you’d expect, early on: 122 people committed in the first four years, but only 65 over the next five years (three have signed up so far in 2019). And while adding roughly 15 people a year might sound like a lot, only about 7 percent of the world’s billionaires have affixed their name to a document; the Giving Pledge particularly has work to do overseas. The most prominent snub is the world’s wealthiest person, Jeff Bezos, whose omission fits with his historically paltry giving to charity (although he has recently tried to atone for that). Some of the wealthiest people in tech remain conspicuously absent from the Giving Pledge rolls: Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Steve Ballmer, and Michael Dell, who are each worth tens of billions of dollars. And the on-the-rise set? The 40-and-under leaders of the next generation of iconic tech companies? People like Evan Spiegel, Adam Neumann, or Ben Silbermann are also no-shows. Rob Rosen, who oversees philanthropic efforts like the Giving Pledge from his perch at the Gates Foundation, argues that it still appeals to today’s younger tech entrepreneurs, naming recent additions like Brian Armstrong, the founder of Coinbase; Garrett Camp, the co-founder of Uber; and especially citing the trio of 30-something Airbnb founders who announced together in 2016 that they would join the effort. Rosen said it felt it had “strong representation” from the tech community, with his team pointing to 46 couples that it says signed the pledge from that sector. The broader challenge for the Giving Pledge — and, to be fair, for all philanthropic efforts — is that newly rich CEOs are often less than eager to want to commit to giving away half their net worth. Who knows what life could bring? So they tend to set up family offices, preserving their options; maybe they’ll begin to think more seriously about philanthropy as they get older, when the money appears less “spendable,” so to speak. But a big push in the philanthropy world is to encourage lifetime giving so that the principals can be hands-on with their charitable efforts rather than passing those duties to offspring. More time to give also means more time to improve as philanthropists. That’s why younger entrepreneurs can have such a big impact if they commit early. That’s essentially the premise of the Founders Pledge — but committing even earlier. People who experiment with philanthropy only when they become billionaires, Goldberg says, are going to have some pretty painful experiences. “When you’re a billionaire, those mistakes are at a different scale than when you’re just Joe on the street,” Goldberg said. Neither Rosen nor Goldberg considers the other a rival — you could certainly sign both pledges, or maybe you’d graduate to the Giving Pledge once a few more millions hit your bank account. “One of the goals of the pledge is to put the conversation on the table of what’s even possible,” said Rosen. “Tech has historically been quite innovative in doing this, so it’s not surprising that you’re seeing some traction.” One reason why rivals’ efforts are gaining traction? Well, the problem with megadonors committing $5 billion to the Giving Pledge in 2019, for instance, is that they still might have $5 billion more in assets that they’re not committing to the Giving Pledge. And being a billionaire is not particularly popular right now. Some Giving Pledge signers these days, such as hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones, are barely publicizing when they sign it lest they remind people of their massive net worths during a time when voices on the left are pounding billionaires for personifying American income inequality. Rosen said his donors are as aware as ever about how their wealth is perceived, but that when it comes to the new dialogue about bllionaires, “net-net, I don’t think it’s had an impact.” Another big difference between the two: The Giving Pledge, as its critics point out, has no teeth but is merely a public affirmation. Founders Pledge is a binding document; it can recoup the money if the signatory renegs. The Founders Pledge, which is headquartered in London and at first hooked European founders, clearly is getting beat in Silicon Valley. So, last month, it opened an office in San Francisco, and Goldberg visits the Bay Area once or twice a quarter for dinners with prospective pledgers. He says his program has merely been a “beta test” until now. What Goldberg has been hearing from Silicon Valley millionaires during that beta: Show me the numbers, not the narrative. “Our members were increasingly frustrated with being told stories,” Goldberg said. “The same way we invest money — we’re hyper-rational and utilitarian in a certain respect — I’d rather achieve more return than less,” he said. “They want to be as rational with their philanthropy as they are with their investments.” And just like Silicon Valley investors claim to offers startups more than money, almost all Silicon Valley-focused philanthropic efforts claim to be more than soliciting money: They offer a “network.” They help you think “long term” and are “patient.” They are a “partner” that wants to be part of a “movement.” More than 8,500 companies have signed this classic initiative in corporate and social responsibility, which Pledge 1% says has led to over $500 million in philanthropy. Amy Lesnick, the Pledge 1% CEO, said she considered the two other efforts not competitive because she is focused on signing up a company rather than a billionaire. But her organization is still competing for the mindshare of a company founder — who might be a Giving Pledge-eligible billionaire, too — who is trying to weigh his personal and professional charitable obligations. Lesnick still stressed ways in which her organization differs from the other pledge drives trying to remake tech philanthropy. “I think that Pledge 1% has a reach and accessibility that is infinitely broader,” Lesnick told Recode in an interview. “We are not just saying, ‘Hey, I’m going to look at who are going to be the companies that are going file for IPO in the next 12 months — and we are only going to talk to them.’” To be sure, there is a world in which all three of these programs patch together to make a philanthropic quilt. Maybe a young entrepreneur signs the Founders Pledge, setting a standard for her personal philanthropy, and then Pledge 1% to set a standard for her company’s philanthropy. And when she really makes it big — becoming a bona fide billionaire — she signs the Giving Pledge. For instance, Benioff, the Salesforce founder behind the Pledge 1% initiative, has signed the Giving Pledge as well. But Benioff is perhaps Silicon Valley’s most omnipresent (and, yes, abrasive) advocate for philanthropy. And given Benioff’s own words in the past about Silicon Valley billionaires, it probably wouldn’t surprise him to learn that they’re not jumping to participate in all three programs simultaneously. “Not all of them are giving money away. A lot of them are just hoarding it,” he told the Guardian last year. “They’re keeping it. That’s just who they are and how they look at their money.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2019/4/22/18491577/founders-giving-pledge-tech-philanthropy-billionaires,,Vox
767,767,01-06-18 00:00,2018,6,1,,EU confident Italy's new government will cooperate with partners,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Friday it was confident that Italy’s new anti-establishment government would cooperate “constructively” with its EU partners.  Italy’s governing coalition was being installed on Friday, calming markets spooked by the possibility of snap elections that might have become a de facto referendum on quitting the euro.  “We have full confidence in the capacity and willingness of the new government to engage constructively with its European partners and EU institutions to uphold Italy’s central role in the common European project,” a spokeswoman for the EU executive told a regular news briefing in Brussels.  She dismissed as “misleading” media reports suggesting that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had shown a lack of respect toward Italians at a conference on Thursday.  Italy’s new nationalist deputy premier Matteo Salvini called Juncker “racist” after media reports that he had said Italians needed to work harder and be less corrupt.  The Luxembourger Juncker, speaking in English, had defended EU support for southern Italy as generous and said it was the responsibility of national leaders in Rome to do more to help the region, to promote employment and combat corruption:   “Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness,” he said.  “We will help them, as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Nations first, Europe second.”  The spokeswoman said on Friday: “President Juncker is committed to work with the new Italian government to take on the many common challenges that Italy and Europe are facing, from trade to migration and many more.”  She said Juncker would meet new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte next week at a Group of Seven meeting in Canada.

768,768,01-08-17 19:58,2017,8,1,"Tim Scott, Ashley  Goodall",Remembering The Time Sonny Rollins Kept Playing With a Broken Heel,"  In August 1986, jazz legend Sonny Rollins and his ensemble performed at Opus 40, a spectacular stone monument in an abandoned bluestone quarry outside Saugerties, a town in upstate New York. Created by pioneering American sculptor, painter and earth artist Harvey Fite, Opus 40 was inspired by Mayan dry-stone construction and scattered rubble was transformed into a series of stone ramps, pedestals and platforms. Rollins chose the site as the monument not only embodied the 'Saxophone Colossus,' his nickname, and the title of his seminal 1956 album, but the stunning and striking visual imagery was a unique backdrop for an open air jazz concert. But as well as being the world premiere of a new Rollins number titled ""G-Man,"" the concert was remembered for a dramatic incident that involved the jazz great misguiding a mid-solo jump from the rock stage and landing heavily on the stone surface six feet below. After a brief and tense pause Rollins continued to play while lying on his back even though it was later learned that he'd broken his heel in the fall. Filmmaker Robert Mugge was there filming his documentary Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Colossus, and captured the moment Rollins fell. ""My initial concern was entirely for Sonny's well-being. That said, I'm a documentary filmmaker, trained to film whatever happens. So, as I ran to see if he was okay, I instructed my four cameramen to keep filming. I should also say that I always try to center my musical portrait films around special moments in the lives of my artist-subjects. In some cases, those moments are events or activities arranged in advance. But in others, we simply happen to be present with cameras running when something unexpected happens."" The footage of Rollins playing, while lying on his back, in a red sweater, white trousers, and Keds, is some of the punkest in jazz, but the moments before were also some of the most tense. ""Initially, Sonny simply lay there with his eyes closed, leading us to believe that he could have been seriously hurt in the jump,"" Mugge told Noisey via email. ""But when he lifted one leg casually overtop of the other and began to play the opening to ""Autumn Nocturne"" while still lying on his back (a feat of impressive physical strength, in and of itself), all of the previous tension was suddenly released."" Mugge, who had shot footage of Rollins playing in Tokyo earlier that year, and who had also directed documentaries on Al Green, Gil Scott Herron, and Sun Ra, later learned that during the Optus 40 performance Rollins was growing frustrated with his newly lacquered saxophone. ""Sonny tried to explain away his behavior as simply an effort to go out and play directly to the audience, complicated by poor judgement regarding the distance he would have to jump from the stage,"" explains Mugge. ""But his wife Lucille later revealed to me what he had told her, which was that, sometime after the orchestral premiere in Tokyo, he had had his saxophone lacquered.  ""When he was doing the solo improvising that day, it was as if he would try to play a vowel, but out would come a consonant. Over time, he became so upset by this that he essentially had a nervous breakdown onstage—at least, that's how Lucille described it to me. Of course, Sonny is such a brilliant musician that, if his horn plays a ""wrong note,"" he can instantly create a new musical context in which the ""mistake"" makes fresh musical sense. However, in the film, you can see him beginning to pace back and forth like a caged animal until he finally makes the six-foot leap off of the stage. At the time, it was the only way he could think to end his distress. Sadly, the jump did lead to a personal injury, but it also led to moments of suspense, and then of magic, as he launched into that beautiful ballad, like a sunrise following a dark night. It's the kind of scene that takes on special resonance because it was neither staged nor expected, and because it exemplifies the risk-taking genius of our greatest living jazz improviser."" ""Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Colossus"", is available in Blu-ray, DVD and digital formats on Aug 4.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xayp5/remembering-the-time-sonny-rollins-kept-playing-with-a-broken-foot,Noisey,Vice

770,770,22-01-18 18:48,2018,1,22,Ezra Klein,Government shutdown: are Democrats becoming more like Republicans?,"On October 7, 2013, President Barack Obama took the podium at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and made the case to the American people that compromise, not ideological showdown, was what the country needed. America was in the midst of a weeks-long government shutdown, a fiasco triggered by the Republican Party’s demand to defund the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government, and Obama’s remarks from that moment are worth reading today. They show how much the Democratic Party has changed — and how much it hasn’t: I heard a lot of talk over the weekend that the real problem is, is that the President will not negotiate. Well, let me tell you something — I have said from the start of the year that I’m happy to talk to Republicans about anything related to the budget. There’s not a subject that I am not willing to engage in, work on, negotiate, and come up with commonsense compromises on. What I’ve said is that I cannot do that under the threat that if Republicans don’t get 100 percent of their way, they’re going to either shut down the government or they are going to default on America’s debt so that America for the first time in history does not pay its bills. That is not something I will do. We’re not going to establish that pattern. In this, you hear Obama make two arguments. One is that budget negotiations should be limited to policy “related to the budget,” that the functioning of the federal government shouldn’t be used as leverage on other policy issues. The second is that Obama is ready and willing to compromise, and that the problem is Republican unwillingness to cut a deal. Today, Democrats still believe half of that formulation. On Friday, congressional Democrats voted en masse against funding the government’s continued operations. They did so not because of anything in the bill, but because of something that wasn’t in it — a deal to grant legal status to the young unauthorized immigrants known as DREAMers. This has left Democrats in an uncomfortable position: In holding government funding hostage to another policy priority, they are employing the same tactics they condemned Republicans for using in the past. Indeed, in 2013, Sen. Chuck Schumer used immigration as an example of a non-budgetary policy that it would be ridiculous to shut the government down over. Well this is awkward. Chuck Schumer in 2013. #Chuckdown pic.twitter.com/3todBxmgj0 The emerging deal to end the shutdown doesn’t change the underlying strategy: Democrats will vote to fund the government for three weeks on the promise of a DREAMer vote, but they are reserving the right to oppose funding again if either the process or the outcome angers them. As was true for Republicans before them, Democrats are now using the continued funding of the government as leverage for their policy priorities. “Democrats, little bit by little bit, are becoming more like the Republicans,” wrote Michael Tomasky in the New York Times. It is a signal of the Democratic Party’s shift toward tougher tactics in the Trump years that some of the loudest voices pushing congressional Democrats to refuse to fund the government without securing legal status for DREAMers are the former Obama staffers who now host the podcast Pod Save America. The group, which runs Crooked Media, has whipped votes, kept tallies, exhorted listeners to call wavering congressional Democrats, and termed the elected officials who agree with them “the Fight Club” and those on the fence “the Waffle House.” They even filmed themselves calling the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a moderate California Democrat, to push her toward confrontation. Trump rejected a bipartisan government funding deal. We asked our Senators to protect Dreamers and children's health insurance, not Republicans in Congress. You should too! The deadline is Friday. Let us know what they say. We'll be keeping track here: https://gettowork.crooked.com/ In this, the Crooked Media hosts have lots of allies — virtually the entirety of the Democrats allied activists and interest group organizations are demanding a hard line. This basic dynamic — outside media and activist groups driving members of Congress to use the continued functioning of the federal government as leverage — is exactly what Democrats condemned the Republican Party for in the Obama years. What Democrats haven’t adopted is the GOP’s policy intransigence. Where Republicans in the Obama years demanded absurd ransoms — like the complete defunding of the president’s signature legislative achievement — Democrats are asking Trump to accept the kind of deal he said he wanted all along, a deal key congressional Republicans have already embraced. The problem is that Trump refuses to make a deal. “I’ll take a bucket, take bricks, and I’ll start building it myself,” said Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), of Trump’s wall, which Gutiérrez loathes as an idea but which he’s willing to fund to protect DREAMers. “We will dirty our hands, in order for the DREAMers to have a clean future in America.” Indeed, it’s the Trump administration that has unexpectedly fought a series of bipartisan immigration compromises that trade legal status for DREAMers — which Trump says he supports! — for border enforcement, funding for the US-Mexico border wall, and assorted other immigration concessions. “Every time we have a proposal, it is yanked back by staff members,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, told reporters Sunday afternoon. “As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we are going nowhere.” But congressional Republicans have broadly backed the White House. “The guys here are together on our position that we’re not negotiating,” said Republican Study Committee Chair Mark Walker (R-SC). “We’ve done our work.” That’s quite a quote: “we’re not negotiating.” In this respect, Democrats feel like they’re stuck in the same position they held in the Obama years: They’re ready and willing to compromise, even on issues like the wall that they really oppose, but Republicans are too deeply in thrall to their own right wing to cut a deal. In 2016, political scientists Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins published Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats. The book argued that America’s two major political parties weren’t mirror images of each other; they were different kinds of coalitions that were composed in different ways, saw politics through different lenses, and employed different tactics. At the base of Grossmann and Hopkins’s book was reams of data showing that the Democratic Party was a more fractious coalition of interest groups that were primarily interested in policy concessions — as such, they took a more transactional approach to politics, prizing strategies that would get them a deal and accomplish their policy goals. Republicans, by contrast, were a more homogenous coalition that cared deeply about conservative principles — as such, they took a more ideological approach to politics, prizing strategies that demonstrated philosophical purity and the performative pursuit of their side’s ideals. This cleavage seemed to explain the different tactics prized and employed by the two parties. For instance, polling showed Democrats consistently prefer politicians who compromise and Republicans consistently prefer politicians who stick to their principles. This seemed to explain why Republicans had shut down the government and threatened the debt ceiling in the Clinton and Obama eras but Democrats did nothing of the kind in the Bush era. Today, Grossmann thinks the Democratic Party is changing. “There is a direct attempt to copy Republicans tactically, particularly in terms of activism and online media trying to hold leaders’ feet to the fire,” he says. But those changes are in service of the Democratic Party’s traditional constituencies and ends: There is a policy outcome of paramount importance to one of the party’s key interest groups, and they’re willing to compromise to get it done. This does make Democrats different from Republicans. Asking Trump to accept funding for the wall, which he supports, alongside a permanent solution for DREAMers, which he also says he supports, is just not the same as asking Obama to defund Obamacare, or to gut federal spending in order to raise the debt ceiling. The tactics are similar, but the goals are different. A simple way of putting both the similarities and the differences may be this: In the Obama years, a highly mobilized and increasingly powerful conservative base demanded hardline congressional tactics instead of permitting policy compromise. In the Trump years, a highly mobilized and increasingly powerful liberal base is demanding hardline congressional tactics in order to force policy compromise. But even if the motivations are different, the reality is both political parties are increasingly embracing hardline congressional tactics, and that creates a logic of escalation that’s difficult to disrupt. As the parties fight harder and dirtier, the other side’s partisans demand that their elected officials respond in kind. Earlier, I quoted from Mike Tomasky’s New York Times column worrying that Democrats were becoming a “mirror image” of Republicans, but even in that piece, you see the logic of escalation’s power: For now, liberals should cheer this unreservedly. ... The Republicans have been playing this way for years. If Democrats won’t, they’ll just lose. You can’t bring a squirt gun to the O.K. Corral. I hear this even from Democratic members of Congress. The tactics Republicans employed in the Obama era have left them feeling like they’d be suckers to swear off similar approaches in the Trump era. As a theory, it makes an overwhelming amount of both emotional and logical sense. But as a governing dynamic for an advanced democracy, it makes continued crises, and eventual disasters, all the more likely.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/22/16918882/shutdown-compromise-democrats-republicans-blame,,Vox

772,772,08-11-17 01:14,2017,11,8,Andrew Prokop,"Virginia governor's election results: polls, live updates, and what to expect","Update: Ralph Northam (D) has won the Virginia governor’s race, according to calls by multiple outlets. Original post: The most closely contested governor’s election of the Trump era so far is here. Voters in Virginia will cast their ballots for either Democrat Ralph Northam or Republican Ed Gillespie Tuesday, in a race that could have major implications for both parties in next year’s midterm elections. Polls have now closed in the state. Polling has shown Northam, the current lieutenant governor, and Gillespie, a longtime Republican operative and lobbyist, in a close race, with Northam generally holding a slight edge in averages and being viewed as the favorite. Still, Democrats have been exceedingly nervous about how this race will turn out, in part because of Northam’s perceived lack of charisma, in part because Virginia polls overstated Democratic leads in a pair of recent high-profile elections, and in part because Gillespie has been hammering Northam on culture war issues like immigration and Confederate monuments. But there’s more at stake in the state than just the governorship — all 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates will be on the ballot too. Republicans currently hold a 66-34 majority in the chamber, a majority that has hamstrung the efforts of Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe to pass sweeping legislation. (The state Senate, which Republicans control much more narrowly, won’t be up for election again until 2019.) More broadly, Democrats have hoped that Donald Trump’s unpopular presidency could energize their votes and help deliver them down-ballot gains in governors’ mansions, congressional, and state House races across the country. Virginia’s elections today will be a major test of whether that’s actually happening. The vote count will be updated below and at this link: Virginia is one of the few swing states in which Hillary Clinton improved on Barack Obama’s 2012 margin of victory — she beat Trump by about 5 points. It’s also a state where Democrats have long held both US Senate seats, and where there is an incumbent Democratic governor with pretty strong approval ratings (McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013). Incumbent governors are not permitted to run for reelection in Virginia, though, so Democrats needed a new nominee. The choice of the state party establishment was Ralph Northam, who was a US Army doctor and then a pediatric neurologist before he entered politics to be a state senator and then lieutenant governor. This would traditionally be considered a strong résumé for a politician, but Democrats have worried that he hasn’t generated enough excitement among their base voters. Republicans, meanwhile, nominated Ed Gillespie, a longtime Republican operative and lobbyist who chaired the Republican National Committee, ran the Virginia Republican Party, and worked in George W. Bush’s White House. Gillespie was the party’s nominee for a US Senate race in 2014, and he ended up coming shockingly close to defeating the incumbent Democrat Mark Warner in a race that few expected would be close. Gillespie is not an outsider candidate in any way, shape, or form — biographically, he’s the anti-Trump. And yet he’s adopted an extremely Trumpy campaign strategy. In a flurry of ads, he’s attempted to tie Northam to the international gang MS-13 on the thinnest of policy pretexts. (Northam once voted against a Virginia law to officially ban “sanctuary cities” — but Virginia doesn’t even have any sanctuary cities, as Dara Lind explains.) He’s also attacked Northam for proposing to take down some monuments to Confederate generals. Northam, meanwhile, has attempted to run a more traditional jobs- and economy-focused campaign, while portraying Gillespie as a corrupt lobbyist who represents special interests. It’s a strategy that does appear to have kept him in the lead in most polls throughout the race. Still, most recent polls show his lead in the low single digits, which is a bit too close for the comfort of Democrats still traumatized by the 2016 outcome. Another thing giving Democrats heartburn is that in both the 2013 governor’s race and the 2014 US Senate race, polls overestimated Democrats’ support. That was particularly true in the latter case, where the GOP nominee — Gillespie — lost by less than a point despite trailing in polls by 10. The flub raised questions about whether pollsters of the state were properly sampling rural white voters. But it should be noted that the polls of the state’s presidential race in 2016 were right on target. Overall, though, the race’s outcome will be important in influencing the strategies of Democratic and Republican candidates across the country in 2018. If Gillespie pulls off the upset, expect many more GOP challengers to follow his lead and fully embrace Trumpist issues — and expect much more Democratic hand-wringing of how best to respond. But if instead it’s a great night for Democrats — say, if Northam pulls out a strong victory and his party makes significant gains in the state House — it will likely be Republicans who panic.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/7/16603958/virginia-governor-results-2017,,Vox

Niagara Falls in Canada and New York






 Sure, you could stay in the U.S. to witness this beauty, but Niagara Falls (or Horseshoe Falls) on the Canadian side offer the superior view -- and is well worth going through border inspection. And what it lacks in size (it measures about 167 feet high), it makes up for in culture. The falls conjure memories of 1950s honeymoon postcards, Nik Wallenda scaling a tightrope, and daredevils in barrels. For some Americans, it's often even their first experience with waterfalls -- and a magical one at that. Check out Niagara Falls Hotels here >>

 Angel Falls is not only one of the world's prettiest waterfalls, but it's also the highest, piercing the clouds at a whopping 3,212 feet. It gets its name from U.S. aviator Jimmie Angel, who was the first to zoom over the falls in a plane -- and what a sight that must have been. Nestled in Venezuela's Canaima National Park, the stunner launches from Auyantepui, a sandstone mountain that dramatically rises out of the surrounding jungle.

Kaieteur Falls in Guyana






 One of the world's most breathtaking and powerful waterfalls is also the most remote. Guyana's Kaieteur Falls, which is hidden deep in the Amazon, hasn't made many bucket lists. But that's not surprising, considering it requires a three-day overland trek to reach (an easier method is via the local airstrip). If you do decide to take the plunge to this South American wonder, you'll be richly rewarded when you reach the Potaro River and experience its foamy water that tumbles 741 feet down into the pool below.

Plitvice Falls in Croatia






 The Croatian coast is a dreamy getaway as it is, but for an even more surreal experience, head inland to the cavernous Karst region, which is home to Plitvice Lakes National Park. The falls here are memorable for the sheer number of streams -- it appears as if a hundred waterfalls are flowing together in a cacophonous harmony. Follow the system of lakes and rivers and you'll see water colors that range from turquoise to azure. The falls also mark the confluence of the Plitvica and Korana rivers.

A disgruntled gamer shot and killed two people and wounded 11 others Sunday at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, before turning the gun on himself.  The suspected shooter was identified by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Department as 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore, who was armed with a handgun that some witnesses said had a laser scope.  The gamers who were killed have yet to be officially identified, although their names are being shared online by friends and family, and in the media as Eli Clayton, 21, of Woodland Hills, California and Taylor Robertson, 27, of Ballard, West Virginia. Robertson, a husband and father of two, reportedly won the event last year while Katz is believed to have won it the previous year. Two other victims were injured trying to escape. One firearm was used in the killings, police said. Law enforcement officials searched Katz’s house in South Baltimore Sunday, according to the Baltimore Sun, as well as seizing his vehicle. “Pray for Jacksonville as we deal with this senseless tragedy,"" said Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry. Police were initially concerned that there was a second shooter, but by Sunday evening Sheriff Mike Williams said police had cleared the scene and ""we have no outstanding suspects."" Police did not have a motive for the shootings, but witnesses said that Katz was angry having lost the tournament. The ""Madden 19"" Xbox tournament was being broadcast online via the Amazon-owned Twitch streaming service. In videos shared online you can hear the gunshots and players' reactions before the stream goes dead.  Jacksonville’s sheriff office said the shooting occurred during the qualifying event at Chicago Pizza in Jacksonville Landing. Game developer EA called the shooting ""a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn. Our most heartfelt sympathies go out to the families of the victims whose lives were taken today and those who were injured,"" a company spokesperson said to Reuters late on Sunday. The shooting seems certain to re-ignite the gun control debate in Florida, which has been the scene of multiple mass shootings over the past several years at the Margory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, and a mass shooting in 2017 at Fort Lauderdale Airport. One player, Drini Gjoka, was struck in the thumb, according to Complexity Gaming CEO Jason Lake. “The tourney just got shot up. I’m leaving and never coming back,” Grjoka tweeted. “We’re obviously shocked and saddened by this afternoon’s events our player, Drini, was hit in the thumb but is going to be fine,” he said in a statement to VICE News. “He managed to escape and run down the street to a nearby gym. He’s currently cooperating with the authorities and we will be flying him out of Jacksonville as soon as we are given the green light from the officials on the ground.” Florida Governor Rick Scott said he'd spoken to the White House, which offered federal resources needed to respond.

776,776,28-01-16 00:00,2016,1,28,Allison Meier,How Five American Indian Dancers Transformed Ballet in the 20th Century,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Five dancers who started their careers in the 1940s redefined dance in the United States, becoming some of the first American prima ballerinas in the world’s top companies, from the Ballets Russes to the Paris Opera Ballet. And they were all American Indians from Oklahoma. Yvonne Chouteau, one of the “Five Moons,” as they were anointed, died this past Sunday at the age of 86. Along with Moscelyne Larkin (Shawnee, 1925–2012), Rosella Hightower (Choctaw, 1920–2008), Marjorie Tallchief (Osage, b. 1926), and, most famously, Maria Tallchief (Osage, 1925–2013), she rose in the ranks of dance when ballet was still not widely appreciated in this country. The women had distinct careers, but they all danced when they were young at powows and caught performances by the traveling Ballets Russes and other companies, propelling them to study professionally. Chouteau, who was Shawnee-Cherokee, explained how she started ballet in Lili Cockerille Livingston’s book American Indian Ballerinas: Of course, my parents were not about to let ballet take me away from my Indian dancing, but they made it possible for me to do both. Looking back, that was very wise, because the recognition I had gained as an Indian dancer offered me tremendous opportunities to perform. I think the San Diego Exposition was the first place that I did both ballet and Indian solos. From then on, I rarely did my exhibition Indian dances without at least one ballet piece. … I had been taught the sanctity of dance as it is seen in the eyes of the Indian and approached ballet the same way. Chouteau joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the age of 14 after, as she put in a 2005 documentary, she auditioned on “a lark.” After touring the world, she returned to Oklahoma and helped start the dance program at the University of Oklahoma in 1960, then went on to direct the Oklahoma City Civic Ballet. You could fill a long litany with the five dancer’s accomplishments, but Larkin’s time in the Original Ballet Russe and her founding of the Tulsa Ballet stand out in particular. Hightower was also part of Ballet Russe and remained involved in ballet throughout France, earning the Chevalier de la Légion in 1975 — while her greatest feat came in 1947, when she learned the lead for Giselle in just under five hours. Marjorie Tallchief was the first American “premiere danseuse étoile” in the Paris Opéra. Her older sister, the unrivaled Maria Tallchief, married choreographer George Balanchine, who in the 1940s and ’50s created leading parts for her in his major ballets, including The Firebird, Swan Lake, and the Sugarplum Fairy in The Nutcracker.  The five never performed together, although all of them but Maria Tallchief, who by then had retired, took part in Louis Ballard’s 1967 The Four Moons at the Second Oklahoma Indian Ballerina Festival. The piece merged movement from ballet with the dancers’ heritage and featured Hightower’s fluid, Choctaw-inspired solo; Larkin’s Shawnee-influenced dance with quick, compacting movement; Marjorie Tallchief’s gestural performance, which evolved from Osage dance; and Chouteau’s somber choreography, developed from the Cherokee and Shawnee dances of her youth. Nora Boustany wrote in Hightower’s Los Angeles Times obituary that the women’s “remarkable accomplishments showcased American dance and talent to the world when Russian stars still dominated that scene.” And as Larkin said in a short documentary produced by NewsOK: “It’s not just a fluke that we are all Native Americans and that we all became dancers.” In the Oklahoma State Capitol, a mural of the five dancers adorns the rotunda. Painted by Mike Larsen, it shows them posed in white tutus, the shadows of the Trail of Tears behind them. Each had a unique style and left her own legacy, but together they promoted their indigenous heritage through the art of dance.

777,777,28-03-19 00:00,2019,3,28,Zachary Small,Was Man Ray the Inspiration Behind the Black Dahlia Murder?,"Steve Hodel believes his father — a friend of the surrealist — committed the grizzly Hollywood murder as an emulation of the artist’s techniques. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads The daytime television talk show Dr. Phil has been running for 17 seasons but has rarely dipped into art historical drama for its content. That changed yesterday when the eponymous Phillip McGraw invited Steve Hodel onto the show to discuss his almost two-decade-long investigation into the Black Dahlia murder — and how his father may have killed the aspiring Hollywood actress as an emulation of the artist Man Ray’s surrealist aesthetic. The death of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short in 1947 captivated the country because of its gruesome details of dismemberment and torture. Her brutal demise was the subject of relentless press coverage; the Los Angeles Record reported on the police investigation of the crime on its front cover for 31 consecutive days. And even today, cold-case enthusiasts routinely visit the details surrounding Short’s death to glean new evidence on the unsolved crime. But few of their hypotheses are as personal as Hodel’s. The former LAPD homicide detective believes his father, George Hodel, is responsible for the Black Dahlia murder and nearly a dozen other lone woman killings in Los Angeles around the same time. Described as a grandiose doctor with a distinct personality, the elder Hodel was the frequent subject of police investigations. Problems began in 1945 with the drug-overdose death of his secretary, Ruth Spaulding, who detectives believed Hodel murdered to cover up a financial fraud case involving illegal abortion services. In 1949, his daughter Tamar accused him of incest, a charge he was later acquitted from in court. That same year Hodel became a prime suspect in the Black Dahlia case and the subject of the police’s investigation into Louise Springer’s murder. One year later, Hodel abandoned his family to live in the Philippines; he wouldn’t return to the United States until age 83 in 1990. Steve’s suspicions grew after his father’s death in 1999. Rifling through George’s old possessions, he found a photograph of a woman that looked remarkably like Elizabeth Short; he also found portraits of his family taken by Man Ray, a family friend. Fast-forward 18 years later: Hodel has made a career investigating his father’s relationship to the Black Dahlia murder and surrealist art. He has written five books about the subject including a New York Times bestseller, Black Dahlia Avenger. And he is certainly not the first person to suggest a connection between Short’s death and avant-garde art at the time. Famously, Marcel Duchamp’s “Étants donnés” (1946–66) was partially inspired by the killing. However, the driving forces behind Hodel’s argument are the visual similarities between Man Ray’s work and the Black Dahlia murder. The former detective believes that his father was trying to emulate the surrealist artist’s work with mutilation of Short’s body. “This is dad’s surrealistic masterpiece,” he told Dr. Phil. “I talk about his scalpel being his paintbrush and her body was the canvas. It’s that twisted.” There are a handful of artworks that Hodel analyzes, including “L’Equivoque” (1943). On the talk show, he said that there are “strong indications that [Short] actually could have posed for Man Ray in 1943” and thereafter. In his painting, Man Ray depicts a female subject with a scratched-out face; Hodel believes that his father appropriated this image with his scalpel to create a similar “crime signature” on Short’s body as an homage to his surrealist friend. Hodel also says that Man Ray’s “Minotaur” (1934) may have also served as inspiration for his father’s alleged mutilation of the Black Dahlia. Made from the torso of a woman’s body, the photograph references the mythological beast imprisoned in a labyrinth on the Greek island of Crete, where youths were sacrificed to appease the gods; as a surrealist work, it also references the suppression of libidinal impulses a la Freud. In 1969, Man Ray also created a lithograph called “Les Invendables,” which he believes matches with the crime scene photography of Short’s body that had circulated through the public at that point in time. Not everyone agrees with Hodel’s analysis, and although his theories have generated significant interest by the public, law enforcement officials have expressed zero interest in reopening the Black Dahlia case based on his evidence, which critics have called circumstantial and highly questionable. Nevertheless, Hodel stands by his claims that connect his father to one of the country’s most infamous murders and the surrealists. “One of the early clues was my recognizing through Man Ray’s artworks,” explained Hodel during his segment on Dr. Phil. “This exact picture of a woman bisected at the waist, carefully posed … it’s of course identical to the crime scene photography.”",https://hyperallergic.com/492217/was-man-ray-the-inspiration-behind-the-black-dahlia-murder/,,Hyperallergic

779,779,04-02-16 15:51,2016,2,4,Mark Bergen,Why Google's Artificial Intelligence Boss Is Taking Over the Search Empire,"As it ballooned, Google’s research group has nabbed a shocking number of computing’s biggest brains. Geoffrey Hinton. Peter Norvig. Ray Kurzweil. Titans of the field. And it held onto its homegrown talent younger minds, like Jeff Dean, a fabled technician. All of them worked the tech and research circuits, got their faces out there. But all of them work for a much lower-key engineer: John Giannandrea. Starting next month, the entire search organization — the beating heart of Google’s $75 billion colossus — will work for him, too. On Wednesday, Google’s veteran search chief, Amit Singhal, announced his retirement from the company. Rather than tapping one of his deputies, Google put Giannandrea, who runs its sprawling research division, in his place and merged the two divisions. The shift caps a broader trend, as machine intelligence advances have crept into Google’s core product. (Google’s founders are, after all, artificial intelligence nerds.) And it reveals the company’s thoughts on the future of search, which is moving to places that need smart AI, like voice, and is something Google must innovate upon and control. It is especially critical on smartphones, where users prefer apps over the Web and which Google doesn’t dominate the way it does desktops. The retiring Singhal, who came to Google from AT&T’s Bell Labs in 2000, is part of a small circle of longtime execs with influence over core products at Google. He is respected inside Google and in the world of Web search and is known as a fierce defender of the sanctity of results (and his search domain). Yet Singhal is not known well outside the company. Even fewer know Giannandrea. But the mild-mannered engineer — described, like many of CEO Sundar Pichai’s deputies, as lacking a big ego — is no novice. He cut his teeth at pioneering Internet companies, and since joining Google in 2010 has overseen the herculean task of moving some of its more far-fetched research from the lab into actual consumer products. “He’s an OG Valley technology visionary,” said Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, where Giannandrea worked as chief technologist during its peak growth. Before that, Giannandrea had stints at early tech firms Silicon Graphics and General Magic. “[He’s] always on the leading edge; [I] always learn new things when I talk to him,” Andreessen continued in an email. “Great news for Google.” Google declined to make Giannandrea available for an interview. But back in the fall, he opened a small information session on machine learning for reporters at Google’s campus. He spoke softly but with a clear command of the material, walking through the significance of the field for Google, very briefly, before handing the stage to his lieutenants. “Recently, it’s been taking an increasingly important role,” Giannandrea said then about the AI approach. “We think that something really big is happening — something new and significant.” That something new is a renaissance in the subfield of artificial intelligence — one where Google is ahead, albeit with ambitious rivals behind it. Machine learning is, in brief, a method for computers to process data on their own, without being explicitly programmed. Thanks to hardware advances and the now gigantic corpuses of data tech companies have, the decades-old science is rapidly entering the real world. For instance, it’s coming to search. From its birth, Google’s search algorithm has been advanced — a secret sauce of weights to surface results. It was also coded by human hands. For some years, Singhal was reluctant to bake machine learning into results, according to former Googlers. But it has slowly crept in, beginning with instant search results and the “knowledge graph” — a connective web of related things that Giannandrea helped bring to Google. Then last year, the company rolled out an AI, dubbed RankBrain, into the search sauce, as Bloomberg first reported. It can, among other things, process never before seen searches with more efficiency. This is key in keeping Google’s engine from growing stale. It also enables more predictive search, delivering results with alarming accuracy. Google cracked intent, overhauling a decade-plus of search engine optimization practices in a short time, said Rand Fishkin of Moz, a marketing software firm. Deciphering first-time searches is critical too because more future queries will come on mobile devices in languages other than English, a point Giannandrea made at the session in the fall. He came to Google in 2010 with the acquisition of Metaweb Technologies, where he was CTO, working on a different variant of AI — one based on connecting related things automatically. Google does this, along with other AI approaches, but it has embraced machine learning systems, like the one behind RankBrain, more warmly. “They allow for much more sophisticated and accurate classifications and predictions about data,” said Chris Nicholson, co-founder of deep learning startup Skymind. “That’s important for Google, because they want to make more accurate predictions about what people are searching for, and what they’re going to buy.” To do that, Google has to be a part of the search. Getting cut out of that process remains one of the gravest concerns at the company. Despite still raking in search ad money, Google faces the threat of losing mobile searches to apps and rivals Amazon and Apple, which have their own machine learning efforts. Hence the rapid evolution away from the old 10 blue links toward Google’s own content, particularly on mobile. Hence the aggressive push to index mobile app content for search, which Singhal led. And hence the absorption of Google Now, the company’s AI-enabled personal assistant, into the search group. While key to Google’s search strategy, that shift created some ripples inside the company. It’s now the type of politics Giannandrea has to handle. A former Googler sang his praise, suggesting that he may be able to change entrenched, “religious” practices in the search org. If he does, he’ll have to do so while also managing the growing team of very smart researchers, ensuring that their work is relevant for Google. And he’ll have to keep the magic alive in that unit, which is competing for talent with several tech giants. “We actually don’t know what the future of our science is going to be,” Giannandrea said at the fall event. “Once it starts working, people don’t think it’s impressive anymore.” Re/code Replay: Amit Singhal at Code/Mobile 2015 This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/2/4/11587564/googles-artificial-intelligence-boss-and-why-he-will-run-the-search,,Vox

782,782,20-02-18 00:00,2018,2,20,Zachary Small,An Artist Prescribes Herbs and Institutional Critique for Social Ills,"The culmination of her residency, Rachal Bradley’s conceptual exhibition, Interlocutor, revolves around low-fi remedies to our high-fi, high-tech institutional ills. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LONDON — An art critic, an herbalist, and a former nun walk into a gallery. I shuffle into a side room alongside other curious visitors for what will be a three-hour tutorial on herbal ointment preparation. The culmination of her residency, Rachal Bradley’s conceptual exhibition, Interlocutor, revolves around low-fi remedies to our high-fi, high-tech institutional ills. Produced by Gasworks in South London, Bradley has transformed the gallery’s interiors with a tonic-infused resin meant to ameliorate the encroaching forces of capitalism assailing the art world. Although it may sound ridiculous, this hippie-dippy endeavor has spent significant time in the planning stages. Rooted in a feminist lineage of institutional critique, Bradley is interested in reviving the autonomy of individuals within patriarchal organizations and arguing for a revival of more spiritual strains of thinking against the cold logic of capitalism. To accomplish this project, she enlisted the help of her sister, Lucie Bradley, a medicinal herbalist based in Glasgow. Before the exhibition opened, both had interviewed the gallery’s employees about their jobs, creating the trademarked and patent pending Infinite Resistance™ ointment that now lacquers the gallery’s floors as a salve. Back in the workshop, we drink marigold tea and watch rosemary-infused oils boil on a hot plate. This is a serious seminar about herbalism, an obvious fact that evaded me for the initial minutes of the session as we discussed the evils of modern medicine and (gulp) vaccinations. (The art world’s appetite for snark has clearly clouded my judgment. How could an Infinite Resistance™ ointment not be a joke?) Lucie Bradley leads us in an open discussion about the history, uses, and implications of herbal remedies. As a diehard urbanite, the idea that seasoning herbs from the kitchen can combat colds, coughs, and the flu sounds far-fetched. Nevertheless, Bradley explains that even dried herbs from Tesco can have some palliative effect on your health. With a background in the hard sciences, Bradley’s justification of herbal medicine is initially convincing. She is not a puritan: she does not demand the end to modern medicine, but rather, the end to normative care. Herbalism is a practice based on hyper-local traditions, organics, and ancestral recipes. As such, it resists the notion that medicinal cures can be standardized without significantly affecting patients. Like her sister, Bradley prizes autonomy as a technique of empowerment against institutional hierarchies. She wants us to trust our instincts when it comes to our pain. This issue, she claims, has to do with normative standards of medical care that treat patients as problems to efficiently solve. Bradley and the former nun agree that doctors in the United Kingdom rarely listen to their patients or read their medical histories. The workshop participants collectively estimate that, at most, physicians spend ten to twenty minutes maximum talking to their patients.  (Actual statistics vary from country to country, but one study from Spain claims that general practice doctors spend less than seven minutes per patient.) Treating pain is also obviously a gendered issue. Numerous anecdotes and studies have shown that doctors often ignore female pain as constructed or exaggerated. I wish that Rachal Bradley’s exhibition had as clear a thesis as her sister’s workshop. Later, with rosemary ointment in hand, I revisited the artist’s exhibition. Although I understand the concept behind Bradley’s empty gallery — presenting this institution as a vapid, empty structure in order to critique other institutions — I find this a lackluster point. The resin-soaked floor of the white cube space feels unbalanced and shifty — a reference to the fragility of cultural structures? In spots, the resin seems to be cultivating mold. I have nothing personal against the mold (except allergies), but it looks less like a solution to institutional ills and more like an aggravation. However, Bradley’s second room is dimwitted. There, inside a fake washing machine, a Mike Piscitelli photograph hangs. An odd addition, it depicts the professional skateboarder Jason Dill, who stands arms crossed in front of the crumbling Twin Towers on 9/11 — billowing smoke and all. Why is this here? As an image of institutional collapse? As an image of tourism? Is such destruction what the Infinite Resistance™ ointment will germinate? More likely, I think, Bradley chose this photograph as a vision of nonchalance in the face of mass atrocity without thinking through its broader implications. Outside, Bradley has added to the gallery’s façade a machine the press release calls “a series of purpose-engineered, vacuum-formed units,” which apparently “transform the organization into a negative ion generator.” Another subject bordering on scientific scrutiny, negative ions are thought to purify the air of harmful pathogens and alleviate depression. Comparing the faltering art magic of Rachal Bradley with the herbal medical-mysticism of her sister, I may just have to side with the plants on this one.

Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, was driving a company vehicle hauling a trailer on a highway in Randolph, police said, when he slammed into a group of 10 motorcyclists. State authorities described the wreckage as the worst they had ever seen.  Zhukovskyy was arrested at his home in West Springfield, Massachusetts, on Monday morning, the New Hampshire deputy attorney general’s office said in a statement.   He later appeared in a Massachusetts state court, where he agreed not to contest extradition to New Hampshire.  A Massachusetts court-appointed defense lawyer appeared with Zhukovskyy, who will receive a new one when he faces criminal charges related to the crash in New Hampshire.  The National Transportation Safety Board on Saturday said it was sending a team to the site of the crash to conduct a safety inquiry and work with local authorities, who are doing their own investigation.  Officials said on Sunday that the victims, five men and two women ages 42 to 62, all died of blunt trauma. The group was associated with the Jarheads Motorcycle Club, which consists mostly of U.S. Marine Corps veterans and their relatives.

784,784,19-06-19 00:00,2019,6,19,Huw Jones,"Britain's bankers call for more support, tax cuts after Brexit","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should create a new body to promote a positive “vision” for banking and cut taxes on the industry after failing to support the sector adequately ahead of Brexit, banking trade body UK Finance’s chair said on Wednesday.  Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 but so far has not secured an exit deal.  To avoid disruption, London-based banks have moved some staff and activities to new hubs in the European Union to maintain customer links, raising questions about the capital’s future clout in global finance.  The government dropped its support for the finance industry’s proposal for mutual recognition post-Brexit to focus instead on a more generous form of future market access to the EU than normally given to non-EU countries.  “I do not think it’s unfair to say that since the financial crisis and particularly during the Brexit negotiations, our sector and services generally have seen nothing like the level of strategic support and attention from government that has been granted to goods and to technology,” Bob Wigley told the UK Finance’s summer reception.  Wigley said the government should create a new, formal body made up of regulators, government officials and the Bank of England governor to set out a positive national vision for the role of the finance industry.  The aggregate rate of tax paid by banks in New York and Frankfurt is much lower than in London, he said.  “This cannot be sustainable post Brexit without an even larger outflux of international banks than Brexit itself may deliver,” Wigley said.  UK Finance members like RBS and Lloyds had to be bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis that ushered in years of belt-tightening for millions of Britons.  As a result, the industry is considered still too unpopular for politicians to be seen supporting it even though finance is Britain’s biggest economic sector, generating an annual trade surplus of about 70 billion pounds.  “With the loss of passporting on Brexit, we will need to find ways of making the UK internationally attractive if we are to retain and attract international banks here,” Wigley said.  Banks were not pitching for a return to pre-financial crisis light regulation, though better coordination among regulators was needed, he said.  “Right now, we are seeing a multitude of new regulatory interventions being delivered by multiple regulators with at best insufficient coordination and at worst conflict,” Wigley said.  “So the first thing this body needs to do is ensure that regulatory initiatives are formulated and implemented with what we call effective air-traffic control – prioritisation and orderly implementation.”  He called for a review of rules to ease the burden on mid-tier and smaller banks, saying poor promotion of competition in the sector meant there is only one mid-tier bank with assets over 50 billion pounds.  He singled out a letter from the Bank of England last week telling 20 small “challenger” banks they needed better controls as they could underestimate the impact of a downturn on their loan books.  It “illustrates an embedded anti-growth, anti-competition bias within the system” that a new body should correct, Wigley said.  In a week when Facebook said it was looking to launch its own crypto currency to expand into payments, Wigley said that “Big Tech” firms moving into banking services should be regulated in a similar way to banks.  “Regulation 2.0 needs to be developed to deal with their business models,” Wigley said.

785,785,22-02-17 21:27,2017,2,22,Sarah Bellman,A Timeline of Controversial Statements at the Oscars," On Sunday, we will witness one of the most politically charged Academy Awards in the ceremony's illustrious and complicated history. Not only has the Trump administration angered a large portion of the population, but, for better or worse, the films and actors themselves have polarized Hollywood. Race, women's rights, diverse LGBTQ representation, and the industry's willingness to sublimate sexual assault are all in the foreground this year.   With our current political climate, it's practically guaranteed that actors, directors, and other industry figureheads will take the stage to make impassioned statements—hopefully before getting played off stage. If we learned anything from Meryl Streep's Golden Globes speech, these statements won't just lead to countless thinkpieces and op-eds—they could possibly stand to be commented on by our own president on Twitter. But politics have always found their way onto the Oscars stage, and in that spirit, we've rounded up a timeline of some of the most controversial moments in Oscars history.    1972: When Jane Fonda won Best Actress for  Klute, she tersely accepted her award, saying there was too much to discuss with little time. Backstage, she expressed to the press her strong opposition toward the Vietnam War, as well as why she didn't talk about it on the stage: ""While we're all sitting there giving out awards, which are very important awards, there are murders being committed in our name in Indochina. And I think everyone out there is aware of it as I am, and I think that everyone out there wants it to end as much as I do. And I didn't think I needed to say it. I think we have had it. I really do. I think everyone feels that way.""   1973: Marlon Brando sent a young Apache activist, Sacheen Littlefeather, to refuse his award for Best Actor, which he received for  The Godfather. She provided a summary of Brando's letter of explanation, which was later published by the  New York Times and beyond. ""He very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award,"" Littlefinger told the confused crowd. ""The reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry and on television in movie reruns, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee."" The Academy immediately banned acceptance speeches by proxy except for rare cases of a winner's death.   1974: On a much more bizarre note, just one year later, gay rights activist and artist Robert Opel streaked on the stage while throwing up a peace sign during David Niven's speech. In good spirits, Nivens addressed the audience with a hilariously savage clapback: ""Ladies and gentlemen, that was almost bound to happen. But isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?""   1978: Because of actress Vanessa Redgrave's open support of Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Jewish Defense League protested her presence at the award show, forcing her to be escorted to the Oscars in an ambulance. When she won Best Supporting Actress for  Julia, Redgrave threw around some strong fighting words, which were met with boos and hisses. Mid-speech, she called protesters ""a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums"" and described their behavior as an ""insult to the stature of Jews all over the world, and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.""   1990: Not all political statements occur on the stage, or are even vocalized: During McCarthy's attack on the entertainment industry, known as the Hollywood Blacklist, Elia Kazan infamously outed fellow directors and actors for having Communist ties. This swiftly made the iconic filmmaker a pariah in the community. Although years have gone by since the damages of McCarthyism, when Kazan took the stage to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, he was met with mixed reactions. While some stood and applauded as per tradition, many sternly sat with their arms crossed. Others, like Steven Spielberg, halfheartedly applauded from his seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable moments in Oscars history, to say the least. It seems that Hollywood never forgets and rarely forgives.   2000: After  Cider House Rules won Best Screenplay, writer John Irving thanked the Academy for honoring a film that tackles abortion—which, obviously, is still one of the most heated topics in politics today. Irving also thanked Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Rights League. ""I want to thank the Academy for this honor to this film on the abortion subject, and Miramax for having the courage to make this movie in the first place,"" he said.  And just this week, John Irving wrote an op-ed for the Hollywood Reporter, urging Hollywood to get political with its speeches this year.   2002: Halle Berry was the first black woman to win Best Actress in a Leading Role for  Monster's Ball. Because of this landmark moment, the teary-eyed actress naturally spoke about those who were historically rejected because of their race.   ""This moment is so much bigger than me,"" she emotionally proclaimed, dedicating her award to actresses who, before her, failed to get the award, and ""every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance, because this door tonight has been opened.""  Most famously, when her speech ran on, she (rightfully) stated that this moment was 74 years in the making, and she was allowed to take her time.   2003: Michael Moore has never been one to stay silent about his opinions. When he took an Oscar for his documentary  Bowling for Columbine, the controversial filmmaker lambasted George Bush and the war in Iraq. However, he wasn't alone. Moore brought the other documentary nominees onto the stage, speaking on their collective behalf.   ""We like nonfiction, and we live in fictitious times,"" he said to a heated crowd. ""We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts. We are against this war, Mr. Bush! Shame on you, Mr. Bush! Shame on you!""   2004: Following in Michael Moore's footsteps, Errol Morris made his own statement about the war when  The Fog of War won Best Documentary.  ""Forty years ago this country went down a rabbit hole in Vietnam and millions died,"" the iconic documentary filmmaker said. ""I fear we're going down a rabbit hole once again. And if people can stop and think and reflect on some of the ideas and issues in this movie, perhaps I've done some damn good here.""   2007: Politician Al Gore's important documentary about climate change,  An Inconvenient Truth, won Best Documentary a few years later. It was inevitable that the subject—which, despite hard scientific evidence, is  still denied or downplayed by conservatives—would arise.   ""It's not a political issue, it's a moral issue,"" Gore said. ""We have everything we need to get started, with the possible exception of the will to act. That's a renewable resource. Let's renew it.""   2009: This year, LGBTQ rights was the hot topic. After winning Best Actor for  Milk, Sean Penn, who played the openly gay politician Harvey Milk, discussed same-sex marriage—that at the time was still not legal—and California's Proposition 8, which reinstated the state's ban on gay marriage.   ""I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support,"" he said. ""We've got to have equal rights for everyone.""  The film's openly gay director, Dustin Lance Black, also made an impassioned speech, telling ""all of the gay and lesbian kids out there"" that ""very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours.""  He was right. The United States legalized gay marriage in 2015.   2010: When  The Cove won for Best Documentary, activist Ric O'Barry, one of the experts used in the film, held up a sign that read ""Text Dolphin to 44144.""   The Academy immediately cut them off by blasting music to force them off the stage before director Louie Psihoyos could finish his acceptance speech. However, it all worked out in the long run, because the brutal and unapologetic documentary inspired many people globally to take into account the horrors that occur to dolphins.   2011: In line with other Best Documentary Feature winners, when  Inside Job director accepted his award, Charles Ferguson got heated about the movie's subject, proclaiming it was wrong that those responsible for the financial crisis were never held accountable.   ""Three years after a horrific financial crisis caused by massive fraud, not a single financial executive has gone to jail, and that's wrong,"" he pointed out right away.   2015: During the budding height Black Lives Matter movement and protests featuring ""hands up, don't shoot""—which is just as crucial today—it was obvious from the start that if  Selma would win, the subsequent speeches would get very political. So it came as no surprise that when accepting their award for Original Song for  Selma's ""Glory"" (which lyrics even address Ferguson), John Legend and Common spoke out about what afflicts the black community today, including poverty, racism, and America's flawed prison system.   ""We live in the most incarcerated country in the world,"" Legend controversially proclaimed. ""There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850.""  In addition,  Boyhood's Patricia Arquette also went on to talk about wage inequality and the glass ceiling. As you'd expect, it drew controversy after she said, ""We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all and women's right for everyone in America."" 2016: As you probably know, 2016 was the year of #OscarsSoWhite, so it was already steeped in controversy. Even host Chris Rock addressed it at every chance he could. However, that wasn't the only political topic brought up that year.  For instance, when Leonardo DiCaprio  finally won Best Actor, he dedicated his precious time to discuss climate change, proclaiming that we should not take our planet for granted. ""Climate change is real. It is happening right now,"" DiCaprio, who is famously an environmental advocate, said. ""We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity.""  In addition,  The Big Short's screenwriter Charles Randolph ranted about big business in politics, saying, ""If you don't want big money to control government, don't vote for candidates that take money from big banks, oil, or weirdo billionaires: Stop!""  Most eerily relevant today,  The Revenant director Alejandro G. Iñárritu gave a speech about xenophobia: ""I'm very lucky to be here tonight,"" he said as the exit music blared behind him. ""But unfortunately many others haven't had the same luck.""   He then quoted the film, which tragically deals with issues of racism, talking about how people to this day are judged by the color of their skin: ""What a great opportunity to our generation to really liberate ourselves from all prejudice and tribe of thinking, and to make sure for once and forever, that the color of the skin become as irrelevant as the length of our hair.""

Some of Alabama’s sex-offender inmates will now be required to undergo chemical castration if they want to be released from prison.  Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed a bill into law on Monday that forces sex offenders whose victims are younger than 13 to take a series of pills that greatly reduce sexual libido as a condition of their parole, according to AL.com. The controversial legislation passed through Alabama’s Statehouse last month, despite it being unclear whether chemical castration works to reduce sex crimes. Alabama is the seventh state, including California, Florida, Montana and Louisiana, to have a chemical castration law, although it’s unclear how often the punishment is utilized. ""This bill is a step toward protecting children in Alabama,"" Ivey said, according to CNN. The inmates will have to pay for their own treatment unless a court rules that’s unreasonable, and will start the process of chemical castration at least one month before they’re released. If parolees stop taking the medication before a court allows it, they’ll be sent back to prison. The procedure can be reversed, and is not as severe as surgical castration, which would remove a man’s testicles.    Want the best of VICE News in your inbox? Sign up here.

Steve Hurst, a Republican, introduced the legislation multiple times over the past several years, and told AL.com Monday he hopes “to track it and to make sure what medical works for what individuals.” He does not consider the law inhumane, and has previously advocated for surgical castration.  ""What’s more inhumane than molesting a small, infant child?' Hurst asked. However, the bill might contradict the Eighth Amendment, which blocks cruel and unusual punishment. A law professor at the University of Florida, John Stinneford, argued in a 2006 paper that such laws should be struck down. Alabama’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union also thinks it runs afoul of the Eighth Amendment, according to AL.com.  “Because chemical castration is designed both to shackle the mind and cripple the body of sex offenders, it is doubly cruel, and should be struck down as a violation of the Eighth Amendment,” Stinneford wrote.

The escape happened after 900 inmates in Puerto Rico’s easternmost prison in Rio Grande were evacuated to another facility before the storm tore through the island last Wednesday. The escapees are just one headache for the beleaguered prison system in Puerto Rico, which includes one federal and more than 30 local prisons holding thousands of inmates.  The U.S. Bureau of Prisons began to evacuate Inmates at Puerto Rico’s federal prison in Guaynabo — which holds 1,389 people — on Monday due to “difficulties in securing supplies and maintaining power.” The agency would not say whether those inmates are relocating to mainland U.S. or other areas in Puerto Rico.

READ: Puerto Rico is desperate and aid isn’t coming fast enough A week after the hurricane struck the island, very little is known about the conditions for inmates who live in the island’s prisons, which are clustered near high-risk flood zones on the coasts.  As the days go by with no communication from prison facilities, families of inmates in Puerto Rico are more and more desperate for updates about their loved ones, who they have not been able to visit since Sept. 18.  The phone line and website for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation are down, and many people have tried unsuccessfully to inquire about their relatives via Facebook. Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Erik Rolón, said Tuesday that the department’s central office is flooded, and prison facilities suffered “minor damage,” but assured the public that the department is keeping inmates safe. READ: Trump still won’t lift shipping restrictions on Puerto Rico “The entire [inmate] population is alive,” Rolón told El Nuevo Día. “I understand the importance of seeing family, even more so in difficult times like these, but that depends on how fast we recover as a country. My goal is that maybe next week we can touch the issue.” A woman who has been trying to reach the corrections department through its Facebook page said her son is an inmate at a prison in Guayama. “I live in San Antonio, that’s why I’m so worried,” Lorna Yamira Colon, 41, said via Facebook. “My family there has not been able to communicate with anyone and it’s too difficult for them to get to the prison in Guayama now.” During Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans officials abandoned some inmates in their flooded cells for several days leading to chaos and attempted escapes. After Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August, inmates reported dire conditions in the federal prison there, including food shortages and sewage flooding. Miami officials decided thousands of inmates would “shelter in place” as Florida braced itself for Hurricane Irma earlier this month. Only 27 percent of Puerto Rico has cell phone service, making it very difficult for people to communicate with authorities or call 911. The police in San Juan reported several robberies on Tuesday, according to El Nuevo Día. Officials said they have made 43 arrests for violating the “dry law” prohibiting the sale of alcohol and 11 arrests for curfew violations. Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Michelle Fraley said Wednesday that her agency is low on officers and resources, “opening the door so that break-ins and other types of crimes can’t be prevented.” ",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/bjd54w/13-puerto-rico-prisoners-escaped-during-hurricane-maria,,Vice News
790,790,22-06-18 13:59,2018,6,22,Tara Golshan,Compromise immigration bill: House GOP delays their much-anticipated DACA bill vote ,"House Republicans are going back to the drawing board on immigration. On Thursday, House Republicans failed to pass a conservative immigration bill originally introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), which would have drastically cut the nation’s legal immigration levels and provided an extension to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. All Democrats and 41 Republicans voted against the bill. This was supposed to be the first of two votes on Republican-led immigration bills on Thursday: Goodlatte’s conservative proposal and a “compromise” bill between House conservatives and moderate Republicans. But House leadership keeps delaying the vote on the “compromise” bill, which offers a Republican solution to DACA and the family separations policy at the border — first for one more day, and now not until next week — in yet another attempt to reconcile some intra-party turmoil between party factions. In other words, they’re preparing themselves for failure on immigration — but they are buying a little more time first. Leadership held a briefing for Republican House members walking them through each provision of the “compromise” bill Thursday evening, after it became increasingly clear that lawmakers didn’t even know what exactly they were supposed to be voting on, and that both bills would have likely failed. “The fact that the room’s full is instructive — there are a lot of questions about the bill,” Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) told reporters coming out of the closed-door Republican briefing. “Well, let me put it this way, I don’t imagine you go through the bill section by section if you have 218 votes.” Meanwhile, Trump tweeted Friday morning that Republicans should “stop wasting their time” with the whole immigration effort and wait until after November when he said there would be a “Red Wave” election, blaming Democrats for “obstructing” negotiations. Needless to say, neither proposal was designed to get any Democratic support, and Republican lawmakers themselves aren’t optimistic they’ll be making any electoral gains in November. Republicans might be delaying the vote, but it’s far from certain that time will reconcile the big divisions on immigration within the Republican Party. The Republican immigration negotiations began to fall apart Wednesday afternoon when conservative Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadow (R-NC) came out of a heated debate with House Speaker Paul Ryan and declared the compromise immigration bill was not “ready for primetime.” The Freedom Caucus controls enough votes to tank either bill. The dispute, Meadows said, was over certain provisions — about border security and judicial purview over immigration cases — that he was told would be in the bill but weren’t. “I don’t care anymore,” Meadows said angrily in his final words to Ryan on the floor. “It doesn’t matter anymore.” By Thursday morning, Meadows said it was unlikely the “compromise” bill could pass on the House floor. At that point Ryan said he would still put up both bills for a vote even if they would fail, simply saying the two votes are so members can “express themselves by voting for the policies they like.” But by Thursday afternoon, conservatives and some in House leadership — like Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) — had advocated for a little more time to negotiate. They also needed more time to tell lawmakers what they would actually be voting on, scheduling a briefing with House Republicans to go over the “compromise” GOP immigration proposal Thursday evening. By the end of the meeting, top Republican lawmakers were saying the bill would be seeing additional changes, including possibly adding conservative proposals like mandating E-Verify, an electronic system that allows employers to check the immigration status of possible employees against federal records before hiring. As it stands, the “compromise” bill would offer legal status for young unauthorized immigrants known as DREAMers and a path to citizenship for some, based on merit; direct billions of dollars toward a southern border wall; make cuts to legal immigration; and make it harder to seek asylum. Confusion about which bills would be getting a vote started Wednesday afternoon. Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), a member of the Republican whip team, came out of a meeting with House Republicans and told reporters there are three possible immigration bills, two of which could get votes Thursday — a sentiment that was echoed by several other Republican lawmakers in interviews with Vox. But House leadership said there are only two. The confusion seemed to be rooted in the fact that Goodlatte is sponsoring both bills, leading some lawmakers to believe there are two conservative proposals and a third consensus bill with moderates. “Believe me ... there’s a bunch of us in there that have got this same issue,” Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) told Vox. “But we have got to vote on it.” There’s a world in which Congress could pass immigration reform. We do not live in that world. Rather, the Republican “compromise” is a clear reflection of Trump’s hardline immigration views; it asks moderate Republicans and Democrats to accept a slew of conservative reforms to almost every arm of the immigration system, legal and illegal, in exchange for a partial and less-than-certain path to citizenship for DREAMers. Already, Democrats have balked at both Republican immigration proposals. And the bill still isn’t enough for conservatives, many of whom are decrying it as amnesty. The partisanship in this House Republican immigration debate is by design. For weeks, House Republican leaders, aligned with the White House, have been urging members to abandon an effort that would have forced votes on bipartisan immigration bills through a discharge petition and instead focus on a partisan Republican-only immigration bill. Ryan and White House officials argued that finding consensus among House Republicans would ensure Trump’s support. But it’s clear this process won’t actually make law. Not only are Republicans having a difficult time finding consensus among their own ranks in the House, neither the Goodlatte proposal nor the GOP “compromise” has Democratic support. Even Trump asked what the “purpose” of the two House bills is, if they are unable to get nine Democrats in the Senate to support it, again blaming the left for “obstructing” the process. But despite Trump’s desire to use Democrats as a punching bag, it’s clear there’s enough chaos among House Republicans alone.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/21/17484842/compromise-immigration-bill-delay-goodlatte-house,,Vox
791,791,09-05-16 00:00,2016,5,9,Ari Akkermans,Turkish Government Censors Video Projection and Youth Biennial Artworks,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads ISTANBUL — This year hasn’t been particularly easy for members of the arts community in Turkey, as they have come increasingly under fire, facing growing censorship and cancellations of exhibitions. It’s an uncertain, tense environment in which there is little tolerance for artistic dissent. This past New Year’s Eve, members of the arts community were arrested during the peaceful demonstration “Barış İçin Yürüyorum (I Am Walking for Peace)” in Diyarbakır, and while they have been subsequently released they might be eventually charged like hundreds of others have been in the aftermath of the Gezi Park protests, including minors and the elderly. In February, the exhibition Post-Peace, curated by Russian curator Katia Krupennikova, to be held at the cultural nonprofit Akbank Sanat, was cancelled a week before the opening because of the delicate situation in Turkey in the aftermath of the Ankara bombings. In March, ARTER, one of the city’s leading institutions, cancelled the opening reception for its major exhibitions of the season, also in response to recent bombings. On the evening of April 26, the 30-by-20-foot screen on the roof of the Marmara Pera Hotel in central Istanbul, host to the community-driven public art project YAMA, stopped playing on a loop the video “Time to Sing a New Song” (2016) by Turkish artist Işıl Eğrikavuk; it had recently opened, on April 23, with its removal becoming the most recent act of censorship by city officials. YAMA’s curator Övül Ö. Durmuşoğlu sent a statement to Hyperallergic explaining that after the screen went dark, she quickly got in touch with the management of the hotel and learned that municipal police ordered a shutdown on the basis of an anonymous complaint, claiming that the new work by Eğrikavuk insulted religious sensibilities. The video animation projected the slogan, “Finish up your apple, Eve!” Eğrikavuk told Hyperallergic by email: “For a long while I have been interested in how, as women we can produce new discourses in public space that say ‘no’ to the existing ones. This slogan says ‘no’ to religious mythical stories that are created by a dominant male language, but also to the current situation in Turkey where hundreds of women are killed by male violence every year.” YAMA has long been the most visible public art project in Istanbul, previously having screened works of internationally renowned Turkish artists such as Emre Hüner and Banu Cenetoğlu. According to Durmuşoğlu’s statement, the PR manager of the Marmara Hotels informed her that there had been a preexisting shutdown order issued by municipal police in response to Finnish artist Pilvi Takala’s work “Workers’ Forum,” also screened by YAMA in February 2016. The shutdown order does not concern only the artworks of Eğrikavuk and Takala, but the entirety of YAMA’s programming, on the basis of “visual pollution.” Both Durmuşoğlu and Eğrikavuk will file for civic action against the Istanbul municipality in the coming days. Eğrikavuk is no stranger to the political climate of Istanbul, to which she has regularly responded: She was for several years a reporter and editor at a daily national newspaper, a columnist on art for the liberal newspaper Radikal, and a lecturer in video and contemporary art at Istanbul’s Bilgi University. Recently, she held a solo at SALT Ulus titled Art of Disagreement where she borrowed excerpts from Turkish parliament sessions and reenacted them. In an email exchange, Eğrikavuk told Hyperallergic about the current mood in Turkey: “Censorship in arts, academia, journalism, in every form of speech is getting wider and more internalized. On the other hand, I am really interested in how, as artists we can deal with this situation. For the past three years there is definitely a shift to act collectively, which manifests itself in more community art practices, but in general we are going through some really dark times.” On May 11, Durmuşoğlu will organize, on behalf of YAMA, a public open debate about the definition of “visual pollution” and the many obstacles for the public visibility of contemporary art in Turkey. YAMA has invited lawyers and a legal expert on censorship to participate in this debate, as well as artist Banu Cenetoğlu and curator Özge Ersoy. The organization has also requested from the municipal police of the Beyoğlu district to send an expert who could accurately define the legal framework of visual pollution. At the same time, on May 8, PASAJ, an artist-run independent space based in Istanbul, informed Hyperallergic that they had resigned as of April 20 from their position as curators of the 4th Istanbul Children and Youth Art Biennial (April 19–May 23), hosted by the municipality of Beyoğlu, and cited censorship. The biennial featured artwork from children from ages 4 to 18, as well as work by professional artists focused on children or inspired by children’s art. During installation week, members of PASAJ witnessed visits from the Beyoğlu municipality, after which children’s artworks that were found troublesome were moved from the Beyoğlu district to the Beşiktas district. Other artworks were removed on the eve of the opening, including a project by Nurdane Turkmen that features drawings by children of the Syrian-Kurdish town besieged by ISIS, Kobane, and 10 videos of images from Gezi Park protests, among others. At that point the PASAJ team decided to withdraw from the biennial after finishing their work with the local children. The biennial committee claims there was no censorship and that PASAJ simply did not do their work properly, according to a statement issued by PASAJ. In response, a number of artists withdrew their work, including Anna Borghi, Ekmel Ertan & Seçil Yaylalı, Esin Turan, Geocyclab, Grete Aagrad & Lars Henningsen, Local A., Stefan Endewart, and Julia Brunner. As of today, the biennial website has not updated its program, which will later travel to state-controlled exhibition spaces in the contested Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Hatay province, along the Syrian border. The actual procedure for arts censorship is unknown and the rules remain seemingly ambiguous, enough to serve only the purpose of targeted censorship. This opinion was shared by a spokesperson, who prefers to go unnamed, for Siyah Bant, a research platform that documents censorship in the arts across Turkey. “Throughout the 2000s, censorship in Turkey has been ‘effective’ mostly because it was arbitrary, and rather than working through direct bans, the government relied on mechanisms of de-legitimation and discouragement,” she told Hyperallergic via email. “Eğrikavuk’s case is an example of how the government censors art by using other regulations as an excuse. It is the government’s new strategy across all artistic disciplines, to legitimize their censorship acts as a part of a procedural act. The questions raised by Eğrikavuk’s work can be thought as a starting point to discuss all those issues in the wider public.”",https://hyperallergic.com/297665/turkish-government-censors-video-projection-and-youth-biennial-artworks/,,Hyperallergic
792,792,30-12-18 00:00,2018,12,30,John Yau,A Dozen Memorable Exhibitions from 2018,"Just because most museums in America are still asleep at the wheel, it doesn’t mean all is lost. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In a turbulent year marked by increasing nationalism, constant attacks on the free press, a retreat from dealing seriously with climate change, and a further, sanctioned erosion of women’s rights, my roundup of memorable exhibitions is nothing more or less than a list of shows that made a lasting impression on me, mostly by opening my eyes and mind to something challenging. These shows reminded me that nothing should be taken for granted, whether it’s drawing with a pencil or crayon, painting with a brush or broom, writing a line of poetry, or reading and interpreting text, from the classical to the arcane. My list is not arranged hierarchically. 1. The exhibition Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, organized by Tracey Bashkoff, Director of Collections and Senior Curator, with the assistance David Horowitz, Curatorial Assistant, challenges any fixed view of art that you might still cling to, despite the museum’s botched, blatant attempt to normalize af Klint by treating her retrospective as a run-up to a related show by R. H. Quaytman. Spirits guided af Klint’s hand and eye. You cannot blame the Guggenheim curators for being flummoxed. They are used to dealing with marketable products, not spiritual inquiries. 2.  Gray Foy: Drawings 1941–1975 at Francis M. Naumann Fine Art was an eye-opener on every conceivable level. Working with, in the artist’s own words, “a hard pencil and untoned paper,” Foy made a small body of drawings of mind-boggling precision and sensual texture. They went unseen for years until this exhibition, which reintroduced this inimitable minor master to a wider public. Initially influenced by Surrealism and the visual hijinks of Salvador Dali and Pavel Tchelitchew, Foy arrived in his own territory when he began making highly detailed, botanically inspired drawings in the 1950s. From that moment until he stopped drawing altogether, Foy pursued his own course. 3. The exhibition Ed Clark: A Survey at Mnuchin Gallery was the latest indication that this important postwar abstract artist is finally beginning to get his due. His contribution to both abstraction and black abstraction has yet to be recognized, partially because he belongs to the generation of abstract artists that was branded as “Second Generation Abstract Expressionists.” If painting had died around 1960, as many have proposed, then what happened in painting after that would have to be a closed book — but, of course, it isn’t. Just because most museums in America are still asleep at the wheel, it doesn’t mean all is lost. 4. In the marvelous exhibition, Harriet Korman, Permeable/Resistant: Recent Paintings and Drawings, at Thomas Erben Gallery, Korman contemplated something basic — the division of a painting’s surface through color and geometry. Instead of regarding painting’s rectangle as a problem, she finds freedom within its limitations, without limiting herself to a signature style. This is a remarkable achievement that has never received the attention it warrants. 5. First known for his concrete poems, Ian Hamilton Finlay moved with his family in 1966 to a small farm on the moors of Pentland Hills, near Edinburgh, Scotland. There, on seven acres of land, he expanded the notion of poetry, spending the rest of his life concretizing words and passages he read (and reread) into sculptures and art works, which were then integrated into gardens and other areas that he carefully cultivated. In the beautifully organized exhibition, Ian Hamilton Finlay: “The Garden Became My Study,” at David Nolan, viewers encountered work where poetry and art, language and object, met. Not derived from a dictionary or thesaurus, Finlay’s use of language comes from his deep reading in divergent subjects, from the French Revolution to classical literature, and a punster’s sensitivity to homophones and other links. It was one of the great shows of the season that seemed to fly under the art world’s radar. 6. Covering nearly four decades, the exhibition Vera Molnar: Drawings 1949-1986 at Senior & Shopmaker offered a fruitful glimpse into the trajectory of Molnar’s career, from post-Constructivist abstraction to algorithmic drawings to — in 1968 — her first use of a computer as a drawing tool, which she has continued to do for nearly 50 years. Other artists have used the computer, of course. Frederick Hammersley made a series of computer-generated geometric drawings in 1969, but Molnar was never interested in making any kind of imagery. The journey she undertook is dazzling. Her pioneering use of the computer and her de facto position, by Sol LeWitt’s definition, as a conceptual artist, give us a glimpse into the unique terrain that Molnar occupies. 7. The exhibition Posing Modernity: The Black Model from Manet and Matisse to Today at the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, curated by Denise Murrell, focuses on the depiction of the black female figure, beginning with Edouard Manet’s 1860s portrayals of the model known only as Laure, who also posed as the maid in “Olympia” (1863). Frédéric Bazille’s “Young Woman with Peonies” (1870), which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., is one of the many must-see works in this groundbreaking exhibition. 8. Marilyn Lerner is an outlier in the domain of abstract art: her inspirations include Hilma af Klint, game boards, tantric art, and trips to Turkey, Africa, and Southeast Asia during the 1970s and ‘80s. While her work shares something with two other underrated painters of cross-cultural hybrids, Simon Gouverneur and Stephen Mueller, Lerner has long followed her own path. Her debut exhibition at Kate Werble Gallery, Marilyn Lerner: Walking Backward Running Forward, reminded me that Lerner’s work is unlike anything else being done.  That should be a good thing, but in an age of copying and plagiarism, originality seems to be getting short shrift. 9. Lois Dodd is one of our best painters. Her exhibition, Lois Dodd: Flashings at Alexandre Gallery, consists of paintings done on flashing, a common construction material made of aluminum. Dodd’s paintings on aluminum generally measure around 5 by 7 inches. They are done in oil with small brushes. Her subjects can include the corner of a house at night, a nude sitting in a garden, a bumblebee landing on a flower, or a pinecone. As Faye Hirsh has stated, they are “unsentimental, untouched by nostalgia or melancholy […].” 10. In the two-person exhibition of Tammy Nguyen and Nicole Won Hee Maloof, One Blue Eye, Two Servings at CRUSH Curatorial, the artists used the motif of the banana to express their concern about the way Asians are perceived in and by America. Although Maloof works in video, etching, and silkscreen, and Nguyen makes paintings, the work in this exhibition reveals the thoroughness of their research. No matter what subject they focus on, they dive deep into every corner as well as ponder every possibility. There were two reasons to see this exhibition. The first was Maloof’s single-channel video, What color is a banana (color, sound, 2017), which touches upon the banana as slang, as a color, and as a fruit farmed by large corporations that care little for their workers. The other reason to go was Nguyen’s “Đức Mẹ Chuối,” which means “Holy Mother of Bananas” (2018), a nearly life-size painting that restates Sandro Botticelli’s well-known depiction of a female nude in “Birth of Venus” (1484-1486) as a yellow-skinned, female Cyclops. 11. The exhibition, Lydia Cabrera and Édouard Glissant: Trembling Thinking at the Americas Society, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Gabriela Rangel, and Asad Raza, has stayed with me. Cabrera and Glissant were important, influential thinkers and writers who are central figures in the postcolonial history of the Caribbean. The exhibition contained early editions of books by Cabrera and Glissant, magazines with their articles, drawings by Cabrera, and a wonderful film interview with Glissant. Many of the other works — but not all — directly address or deal with Glissant and Cabrera and their considerations of identity. The list of artists included Etel Adnan, Kader Attia, Tania Bruguera, Manthia Diawara, Mestre Didi, Melvin Edwards, Simone Fattal, Sylvie Glissant, Koo Jeong A, Wifredo Lam, Marc Latamie, Roberto Matta, Julie Mehretu, Philippe Parreno, Amelia Peláez, Asad Raza, Anri Sala, Antonio Seguí, Diamond Stingily, Elena Tejada-Herrera, Jack Whitten, and Pedro Zylbersztajn. While the show was modestly sized, it opened or pointed to many doors that I have begun to research further. Cy Twombly, “Untitled (In Beauty it is finished)” (1983–2002), [detail], acrylic, wax crayon, pencil and pen on handmade paper in unbound handmade book, 36 pages; each page: 22 3/8 × 15 3/4 inches, collection Cy Twombly Foundation (© Cy Twombly Foundation, image courtesy Gagosian Gallery)12. This first in-depth exhibition of the artist’s drawings, Cy Twombly: In Beauty It is Finished: Drawings 1951-2008, at Gagosian proved beyond a doubt that Twombly cared deeply about poetry, from the archaic Greek poet Sappho, whose work survives in fragments, to the 13th-century Sufi mystic Jalaluddin Rumi, to the radical 19th-century Italian, Giacomo Leopardi, to the first modern poet, Charles Baudelaire. His passions and enthusiasms extended to paintings of all kinds, as well as to history, mythology, music, and much else, and he did not care if others did not share them. He was learned in a non-scholarly way. For him, culture was a living thing. Twombly’s drawings are about the awakening of the senses and the recognition of the transience of an erotic awakening. This compact state of intense sensory consciousness and its unavoidable dissipation are themes that few artists have ever expressed so precisely in their work. There has been no one like Twombly in American art. He was a self-indulgent hedonist of the highest order, which is to say a formally rigorous artist for whom line and color meant everything.",https://hyperallergic.com/477540/a-dozen-memorable-exhibitions-from-2018/,,Hyperallergic

Google will reveal its latest devices at the “Made by Google” event in San Francisco next month, including a smartphone made in collaboration with HTC. Google is already a major player in the smartphone market; it’s Android software runs on 85 percent of all new devices. Google’s previous foray into the hardware market was a questionable flop. It acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2012, before selling it two years later to Chinese PC manufacturer Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google reset its smartphone hardware strategy last year, launching the critically acclaimed Pixel line. But an inability to scale manufacturing meant they sold in small numbers. Some technology watchers had predicted a more dramatic HTC takeover — including its manufacturing plants — as a way to compete with Apple and Samsung, however by acquiring the smartphone-savvy talent — along with a few patents — Google has done little to change the hardware market dynamic. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware, posted a blog announcing the deal. He said it was part of Google’s “continuing big bet on hardware” and that it was “investing for the long run.” Reacting to the deal, Benedict Evans, a former telecoms analyst who now works at Silicon Valley VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, said Google would need to make a more sizeable investment in order to compete with Apple or Samsung. “A few years ago Samsung was spending $10billion a year on marketing handsets. Would Google go to war?” Evans tweeted. Unlike Apple, which makes most of its money from hardware, Google’s approach is to make money from being everywhere. If Google changed this approach — to making money from devices — it would undermine the companies who build and sell over a billion Android smartphones every year.

798,798,18-03-16 14:00,2016,3,18,Jason Del Rey,Payments Startup Stripe to Help Cuban Internet Startups Set Up Shop in the U.S.,"Stripe, the high-profile Silicon Valley payments startup, has long said it wants to make it easier for entrepreneurs located in one part of the world to do business with customers based in another. The next step along that path? Helping Cuban Internet startups with global ambitions to incorporate as a U.S. business and gain access to the U.S. banking system. The foray into Cuba is an extension of a new program called Stripe Atlas aimed at giving overseas entrepreneurs easier access to the U.S. financial system, while funneling more international startups into Stripe’s core payment processing business where it makes the vast majority of its revenue. It comes on the heels of President Obama’s easing of parts of the U.S. embargo against Cuba that had restricted Cuban citizens living in Cuba from earning money in the U.S. or opening a U.S. bank account. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said the expansion into Cuba came together quickly after White House officials recently visited with aspiring Cuban entrepreneurs who requested such a service. “Banking and payments, and generally the movement of money, was extremely difficult for them,” Collison said, “and those are the primary impediments to a thriving ecosystem.” Stripe will work with a Havana-based group called Merchise Startup Circle to help navigate the nuances of the Cuban startup scene and find businesses that would be a fit. The Atlas program is geared toward Internet businesses that want to sell to customers globally or in the U.S., secure investment from American investors or set up some sort of presence in the U.S. For $500, Stripe will help Cuban businesses incorporate as a Delaware business, open a bank account and get some basic legal and tax consultations. The $500 price tag is a lot of money in some parts of world, but co-founder John Collison previously told Re/code that’s “deliberate” to make sure the program is attracting serious entrepreneurs who recognize “incorporating a company is a serious thing.” The program in Cuba will face hurdles. Less than 5 percent of Cuban households have Internet access in their home today, and while the privatization of the economy has been happening, there’s a way to go. But the government has said it wants 50 percent of households to have Internet access by 2020, which is one of the reasons Stripe thinks now is a smart time to start building relationships there. “A majority of the world’s developers are in what we currently call emerging markets,” Patrick Collison said. “Companies that fail to take these markets seriously are really going to be left behind.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/18/11587068/payments-startup-stripe-to-help-cuban-internet-startups-set-up-shop,,Vox

Thousands of people across the affected region are homeless, according to the agency. Rescue efforts are complicated by the region's rugged geography. Many of the towns that have been hit the hardest are in hard-to-reach mountainous areas; several villages near Amatrice are situated at altitudes up to 3,000 feet (1,000 m) at the end of winding, narrow roads. The town of Accumoli, the quake's epicenter, is in the Appennine Mountains northeast of Rome. ""Not a single house is habitable,"" the mayor of Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci, told ANSA. ""We'll have to put everybody in tents."" The quake struck near L'Aquila, where an April 2009 earthquake devastated the city, killing 309 people. While the shocks were felt strongly in Rome, there are no reports yet of damage to the city's infrastructure or to its artistic heritage.

801,801,09-11-16 05:16,2016,11,9,Dara Lind,"How exit polls work: when they're released, which states they cover, and what they mean","The American public will find out whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has won the 2016 presidential election long before the last vote is counted. Or rather, we’ll think we know. Because as polls are closing across America, media outlets are releasing exit poll results — predicting who will win a state, and providing more information about who really turned out to vote and why. The exit polls will shape the story of the election — they’ll provide the record that people will refer to in the future when they talk about what issues mattered and how our 45th president built a successful coalition. But to understand how accurate the exit polls really are — and whether you should trust their predictions about who’s going to win — you have to understand how the exit polls are conducted, and why. If you’re a critical consumer of exit poll data, you’re less likely to be duped by bad information on election night, and more likely to understand whether the exit polls are really telling the story of the 2016 election. Every November election, exit polls are conducted by a group of media outlets called the National Election Pool: NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, CNN, and the Associated Press. They hire a pollster to conduct the exit poll, but they're the ones that own the information — and that get to be the first to report the results. The actual polling happens in two parts. The most visible part of the poll happens in person on Election Day. An army of thousands of interviewers are sent to hundreds of polling places around the country. Interviewers approach a certain number of voters who are leaving the polling place — the exact fraction surveyed is secret — and ask them to fill out the written exit poll survey. Pollsters estimate they’ll interview about 85,000 people on Election Day. But part of the exit poll has already happened before Election Day. As early voting has become more popular, it's gotten harder to predict vote totals just by talking to people who vote on Election Day. So for the past several elections, exit pollsters have started calling people and asking if they voted early or absentee — then conducting exit poll interviews by phone. (In 2016, pollsters estimated they’d contact about 16,000 voters this way.) The primary purpose of the exit poll is to allow TV networks and the AP to project who's won races as soon after the polls close as possible. That means that in 2016, only 28 states are going to have state exit poll results published. That includes obvious presidential battlegrounds (Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin), states with key Senate races (Indiana, Missouri), and states that are just really big (New York, California). If a state is clearly a safe state for either Democrats or Republicans — Massachusetts or Tennessee, for example — exit pollsters still send people to do interviews there, for the purpose of the national poll. But they don’t collect enough interviews to publish reliable poll results. The exit poll pool cut back its efforts since 2012, when 31 states were surveyed in depth. That could lead to some surprises. Alaska, for example, isn’t being surveyed this year but has been surprisingly tight in presidential polling. But it’s hard to imagine either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump paving a path to 270 electoral votes without the exit poll identifying the winner. But the exit poll isn’t just about whom people voted for — that’s why there are interviewers even in safe states. Voters are asked to provide basic demographic information like gender, age, and ethnicity. Furthermore, they're asked some questions about their personal viewpoints and behaviors — like their religion and churchgoing habits — and questions about major issues facing the country. That means the exit poll data is actually more detailed, in some ways, than the official US Census vote tallies that come out several weeks after the election. It can offer the first hints — and often the most important ones — to what voters thought this election was about. That's very important to pundits as they try to interpret what it means. In 2004, for example, post-election chatter focused on ""values voters."" Voters who attended religious services regularly had overwhelmingly voted for George W. Bush. That narrative came out of the exit poll data. Of course, what voters say is important to them is partly what campaigns have told voters is important — there's political science research suggesting that when a campaign hammers particular issues, those are the issues that the candidate's supporters say are most important to them. But the exit poll is still the best opportunity the national media has, in some ways, to figure out who voted, why, and how. The media outlets running the exit poll want to be able to describe who's voting, and whom they're voting for, to the public as early as possible. But they don't want to have any influence on who ends up voting — they don't want anyone deciding not to vote because they've already seen what the exit polls say and they don't think their vote will matter. (There's some evidence that this happened back in 1980, when some outlets projected that Ronald Reagan would win the presidential election before polls closed on the West Coast.) In some countries, like the United Kingdom, it's actually illegal for any media outlet to report exit poll results before the polls close. In the US, it's not illegal, but there's a binding agreement among the media outlets that run the exit poll that none of them are allowed to leak any results before the polls have closed. Sometimes, networks slip up. In 2014, for example, Fox News showed early exit poll results in New Hampshire before polls had closed there in a tight Senate race. The network argued that it hadn’t broken the exit poll rules because it technically didn’t show how many respondents had voted for Jeanne Shaheen or Scott Brown — it showed how many people said they would vote for each candidate if the race came down to a runoff. (Other outlets disagreed, but Fox wasn’t kicked out of the consortium that uses the exit poll.) In 2016, some media outlets are trying to find their way around that agreement: Slate, for example, is using its own election data tool to share turnout projections in real time. But it’s not using the official exit poll results. Reporters are allowed to see some of the exit poll results as they're being compiled throughout the day, but they're under super-strict security — we're talking no-phones-allowed-in-the-room-where-the-results-are-kept levels of security. And there's a strictly regimented schedule for when exit poll results can get released. Around 5 pm ET, media outlets are allowed to start reporting what the exit poll says about who turned out to vote — the racial, age, or party breakdown of voters. But these are preliminary results, and they're going to be skewed toward people who voted early in the day. So groups who tend to vote later in the day — like young voters — might be underrepresented in the stats that first get announced. As soon as polls close in a particular state, media outlets are allowed to project who's going to win elections there, based on the exit poll results. In deep blue or deep red states, where the outcome of the election isn't really in doubt, media outlets don't waste any time projecting winners. So the minute 7 pm hits on the East Coast, for example, you can expect to see CNN and the AP make a bunch of projections at once. In states with closer races, media outlets will often wait to get the final exit poll results (including people who voted right before the polls closed), or wait to see how actual vote tallies stack up when precincts start reporting official vote totals. There has never been an actual leaked exit poll in the US. But there have been plenty of hoaxes. If you see anyone on Facebook sharing ""LEAKED EXIT POLL RESULTS"" while the polls are still open, be very, very skeptical. This will be a little tricky in 2016, because Slate’s real-time Votecastr project might confuse people into thinking that exit poll results are being leaked or released throughout the day. As long as you understand what those results really are — estimates of who will win based on turnout projections — you’ll be fine, but don’t mistake them for “leaked” exit poll results. And definitely don't decide not to vote just because you saw something in a leaked exit poll. No. In fact, there are some particular challenges that exit polls have faced for the past several elections that they still haven't found a way to work out: Early voters. The phone poll for early voters is a relatively new addition to the exit poll— and it’s still a relatively minor one, compared with in-person polling. Early voting itself, meanwhile, has gotten very popular very quickly. In key states like Nevada and Florida, it’s estimated that fewer people will show up to vote on Election Day than showed up during early voting. The exit poll understands the huge role early voters will play — pollsters estimated to Pew that 35 to 40 percent of all voting will happen early this year — but it’s not clear that their polling can accurately capture who those people are. It runs into the problems any phone poll has — namely, that it's difficult to poll people who only have mobile phones. And because this year saw such a huge surge in early voting, it’s hard to use past years to predict how representative a sample is. It’s unlikely that any state is going to get called the wrong way because the exit polls didn’t include enough early voters there. Networks are aware of the early voting data, and if, say, the exit polls suggest Donald Trump will eke out a narrow victory in Nevada, networks will probably wait until some of the votes are counted to see whether Trump was really able to surmount Hillary Clinton’s early voting lead there. But the demographic and other data the exit poll provides might be skewed in favor of people who voted in person — who might not be the voters who decided this election. Small groups. Like any poll, the smaller a sample size is, the less likely it is to be representative. So the exit poll is pretty reliable when it comes to large demographics (men, women, Democrats, Republicans) but less reliable when it gets to small demographics (young voters, Jewish voters). Voters of color. In addition to the general problems with smaller voting demographics, analysts believe the exit poll has a tendency to oversample a particular kind of voter of color — the kind who lives in majority-white areas. Here's the logic. Even though the public doesn't know exactly how the exit poll chooses where to go, it's possible to make some educated guesses. The exit poll is trying to predict the margin of victory for one candidate over another across the state. So when it decides which polling places to put interviewers outside of, it's reasonable to assume that it's choosing lots of swing precincts — precincts that are harder to predict and likely to affect the outcome. Those are going to be largely white precincts. Alternatively, says Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions, exit pollsters might choose a precinct as a benchmark based on the last cycle. For example, if a precinct voted for the Democratic senator 70 percent to 30 percent in 2008, the pollster might choose to put an exit poll interviewer at that precinct to see if the Democrat is getting less than 70 percent of the vote this time around. But pollsters are not necessarily paying attention to the racial makeup of those precincts. Here's why this is a problem: The voters of color pollsters run into in majority-white precincts might not be representative of the voters of color across the state. In particular, according to Latino Decisions, voters of color living among whites are ""more assimilated, better educated, higher income, and more conservative than other minority voters."" Check out the difference in the percentage of nonwhite voters who had a college degree in 2010, according to the US Census versus the exit poll: And the problem is even worse for Latino voters, because exit polls are almost never offered in Spanish — even though more than a quarter of Latino voters prefer Spanish to English. So the exit polls oversample English-speaking Latinos. All these issues together mean that the exit polls sometimes think Latino voters are much more favorable to Republicans than they actually are. In 2010, for example, Harry Reid won reelection to the Senate by turning out Latinos to vote against his Republican challenger, Sharron Angle, who was running as a hardcore immigration hawk. But according to the exit polls, 30 percent of Nevada Latinos voted for Angle — many more than voted for John McCain for president in 2008. (When the official vote tallies came out, it became clear that more than 90 percent of Latinos had voted for Reid.) Nope! As a matter of fact, even with the issues listed above, exit polls have historically been biased toward Democrats more often than they've been biased toward Republicans. In 2004, for example, the exit polls overestimated John Kerry's share of the vote (by ""more than one standard error"") in 26 states; it overestimated George W. Bush's share in only four states. The reason for the error? Bush voters were more likely than Kerry voters to refuse to answer a pollster's questions after they left the voting booth. Traditionally, the exit polls don’t get the outcome wrong that often. The errors in exit polls aren't enough to get the outcome of the race wrong — they just might misstate how much the victor won by, or who supported him/her the most. Admittedly, this is not a typical election, and it’s possible the electorate won’t be typical either. The data from early voting suggests that pollsters might have underestimated the Latino vote and (perhaps) misjudged how many of them would vote for Hillary Clinton. That’s the sort of error the exit polls would also be liable to make. On the other side, Republican champions of Donald Trump suggest he’ll be able to turn out unexpected numbers of white voters without college degrees — who are liable to live in deep red areas where the exit pollsters won’t be either. But these are reasons to be cautious of the demographics that the exit polls present in their detailed data. Exit polls aren’t the only reason a state gets called. By the time exit polls can be released, networks have a day’s worth of information about how an election has gone in a particular state — and if they think that information shows the exit poll might be wrong, they’ll wait to call the state for Trump or Clinton. If the polls close on Election Day and CNN immediately projects that your preferred presidential candidate will lose your state, don't hold your breath for an eventual victory. But if the exit polls project your candidate will win and he or she ends up losing, it’s the fault of the exit poll, not proof of a rigged election.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/8/13563308/exit-polls-2016-time-election-results,,Vox

(Reuters) - The Florida Senate rejected a proposal to ban assault weapons, and voted for a measure to arm some teachers, weeks after 17 people were killed in the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.  An amendment that would have banned assault weapons attached to a wider bill failed on Saturday in a largely party-line vote, in response to the Feb. 14 killing of 14 students and three faculty at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland.  The vote was 20-17 against the assault weapon ban, with two Republicans joining all of the senate’s 15 Democrats in support of the proposal, the Miami Herald reported.  The full bill, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, is expected to pass the state Senate on Monday, then go to the Florida House.  After the Senate rejected the ban, Stoneman Douglas student Jaclyn Corin tweeted, “This breaks my heart, but we will NOT let this ruin our movement. This is for the kids.”  Fellow classmate David Hogg, who has become one of the school’s leading activists on gun safety, tweeted, “Elections are going to be fun!”  Also, an amendment to remove a provision to train and arm some teachers failed.   The bill raises the minimum age to buy a rifle or a shotgun to 21 from 18 and bans the use, sale or possession of bump stocks, which were used in the Oct. 1 shooting deaths of 58 people in Las Vegas. The device effectively turns semi-automatic weapons into automatics.  The bill includes $400 million in funding for schools to address mental health issues, the Herald reported.  Nikolas Cruz, the accused 19-year-old killer who was expelled from Stoneman Douglas, had a history of run-ins with the law and school officials. The Broward County school system and sheriff’s department have been criticized for not acting on red flags on Cruz’s mental health problems and potentially violent behavior.

Wearing an open-necked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan ""Make America great again"", Trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following Britain's vote to leave the EU on Thursday. ""There's always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do,"" he said. Global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on Friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31-year low.

Trump last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe. In an article in a Scottish newspaper earlier this year, Trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that Americans would get if he were to become president.

But as he continued, his dry delivery of increasingly strange costume ideas got everyone — including a barely contained Fallon — on board. Julio Torres (@juliothesquare) offers some ideas for Halloween costumes, such as ""A Raccoon, Foolishly Wearing All The Diamonds He Stole"" pic.twitter.com/fulx4gLArG Torres continued: “How about a Ferrero Rocher chocolate?

Or a raccoon, foolishly wearing all the diamonds he stole?” Whenever Fallon asked him to come up with something “simpler,” Torres shrugged and suggested yet more existential options like, “Turtle who just told off another turtle and now has to turn away and storm off very slowly.” For his own costume, Torres revealed, he’s stuck between “being a secret or a rumor.” I could continue to list the punchlines, but trust me: There’s no substitute for watching Torres deliver them himself, in his unflappable deadpan.

Wall Street’s major stock indexes closed higher after falling for two days as investors regained their appetite for risk assets.   The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, potentially adding to concerns about the U.S. labor market after May job growth slowed. Other data showed import prices fell by the most in five months in May in the latest indication of muted inflation pressures, adding to expectations the Fed will cut rates this year.  “There are still concerns over geopolitical risk,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.    “The market is waiting to hear from the Fed ... and whether they will deviate at all from their latest stance, and I call it an active dovish position, to see if they continue to lay the groundwork for a rate cut perhaps later in the summer.”   The S&P pared gains slightly after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, without offering concrete evidence, the United States believed Iran was responsible for tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 101.94 points, or 0.39%, to 26,106.77, the S&P 500 gained 11.8 points, or 0.41%, to 2,891.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.41 points, or 0.57%, to 7,837.13.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.16% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.06%.  After falling hard on Wednesday, oil futures rebounded sharply on the news of the tanker attacks near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for seaborne oil cargoes.  U.S. crude settled up 2.23% at $52.28 while Brent rose $1.14 to $61.31.  Increased expectations of Fed rate cuts pulled short-dated U.S. Treasury yields lower on Thursday, steepening the yield curve ahead of Friday’s retail sales data and the Fed’s meeting next week.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.0979%, from 2.127% late on Wednesday.  In currencies, the U.S. dollar was little changed against the euro as investors were slow to take large positions before the Fed meeting and the G20 summit later in June when U.S. and China leaders are expected to discuss trade.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.05%, with the euro down 0.12% to $1.1273.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.11% versus the greenback, to 108.40 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2675, down 0.09% on the day.  Gold prices edged higher on expectations for a U.S. rate cut after the soft inflation data, although the uptick in equities capped gains.  Spot gold added 0.6% to $1,341.37 an ounce.

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, onstage at the Code Conference with CTO Mike Schroepfer, told Kara Swisher that because Thiel isn't using Facebook resources to go after Gawker, it's not Facebook's problem. ""Issues of independence in media are key to democracy,"" Sandberg said. ""Peter did what he did on his own. Not as a board member — and you should talk to him."" There's some recent precedent here. Back in February, when Facebook board member Marc Andreessen made an offensive tweet toward Indians in the aftermath of Facebook's Free Basics mess, Mark Zuckerberg quickly distanced the company from Andreessen's remarks. Sandberg says the Thiel thing is different. ""It almost looked like [Andreessen] was speaking for Facebook,"" she explained. ""There's been no implication that [Thiel] was speaking for Facebook."" In response to an audience question from ex-Vox Media editor Joshua Topolsky, Sandberg added that ""these are hard issues, and no one's going to pretend it's easy for the companies."" ""Peter did what he did as an independent person and he didn't get any Facebook resources,"" Sandberg argued.

813,813,08-08-18 00:00,2018,8,8,Pete Schroeder,Trump administration cuts staff at financial markets watchdog: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration moved on Wednesday to shrink a government agency tasked with identifying looming financial risks, notifying around 40 staff members they would be laid off, according to a person familiar with the changes.  The employees at the Office of Financial Research (OFR) were formally told on Wednesday they will lose their jobs as part of a broader reorganization of the agency that was created in the wake of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the source said.   The overhaul forms part of a broader push by the Trump administration to reduce government bureaucracy by slashing government jobs and cutting regulations.   Staff at the OFR, an independent bureau within the U.S. Treasury that analyzes market trends to spot financial risks, were told in January that jobs would be eliminated as the administration sought to cut the OFR’s budget by 25 percent to around $76 million, the person said.  Some staff have left voluntarily up until this point, this person said. They added that the OFR is also working with the Treasury to find new roles for other OFR employees.   “We are working to make OFR a more efficient organization with a stronger workforce and culture to better execute on the mission,” a spokesman for the Treasury said in an email statement.  “The plan to reshape the workforce was announced to OFR employees in January, and the headcount reduction is an important step toward streamlining operations and reducing costs,” he added.  In its 2018 budget request, the OFR said its financial year 2016 full-time headcount was 208 but that it aimed to reduce that to around 139. The headcount target remains at approximately 140,  roughly 65 percent of the agency’s peak 217 staff, the source said.       The OFR has for years been under attack from congressional Republicans and other critics who claim the agency is unproductive, unnecessary and another form of intrusive government bureaucracy.  Consumer advocates say the bureau provides a critical function by gathering data on areas such as banking, lending and trading from the country’s complex web of federal and state regulators to provide a bird’s-eye view of system-wide risks.   The OFR is one of several financial regulators being overhauled under President Donald Trump, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, also housed within the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   These watchdogs have frozen or are rolling back rules introduced following the financial crisis, such as curbs on predatory lenders and the designation of some firms as systemically risky.  The OFR’s original head, Richard Berner, left at the end of 2017. Ken Phelan, a Treasury official, has served as its acting director since then. The administration has nominated Dino Falaschetti, an economist for congressional Republicans, to fill the role on a full-time basis.   His nomination is pending before the U.S. Senate.

817,817,17-06-19 21:20,2019,6,17,Dylan Scott,"Trump’s new health care plan, health reimbursement accounts, explained","President Trump long ago gave up on his promise to deliver “health care for everybody,” but his administration does have something else in mind: health reimbursement arrangements. The Trump administration finalized some new regulations late last week for those tax-preferred accounts. In short, employers can pay money into their employees’ health reimbursement accounts, and then the workers can take that money and use it to buy insurance on the individual market. Companies can alternatively pay into a different kind of HRA that their workers can then use to pay directly for health care or for a “short-term limited duration” insurance plan that does not have to comply with Obamacare’s rules about preexisting conditions. The regulations do put some important standards in place. For example, employers can’t pick and choose individual workers to provide HRA money to, and they cannot offer the same employees both a traditional employer-sponsored insurance plan and an HRA. But health care policy experts still expect a negative effect on the individual markets set up by the Affordable Care Act. That’s because employers in states where individual coverage is currently available relatively cheaply will have a stronger incentive, particularly if they have a sicker workforce, to offer HRAs. They can spend less on an HRA than they would on offering insurance plans. But if those companies funnel their sicker workers into the ACA markets, then premiums for the Obamacare coverage are going to increase. “Potential disadvantages, as always with insurance, involve the potential for gaming,” Katherine Hempstead, senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told me. “If employers are able to use this to dump expensive employees in the individual market, they would save money but the individual market could become unaffordable.” I exchanged emails with Hempstead about the Trump administration’s new HRA regulations. Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length. What the heck is an HRA? Is this like an HSA, a health savings account, something people might already be familiar with? HRA stands for health reimbursement arrangement, and it is one of a number of tax-preferred health benefits. HRAs are employer-funded and reimburse employees for making certain health expenses, which under this new rule would now include premium payments in the individual market. HSAs are savings accounts to which both employers and individuals can contribute. So what are the potential advantages for employers and their workers? Employers could make contributions to employees’ health insurance without actually having to administer a group health plan. Employees could gain more choice and potentially get a plan that better suited their preferences. The individual market as a whole could improve if there was more enrollment coming from group, and that could result in more options and/or better affordability. What are the potential disadvantages? Potential disadvantages, as always with insurance, involve the potential for gaming. If employers are able to use this to dump expensive employees in the individual market, they would save money, but the individual market could become more expensive. Employees may or may not like the individual market options as much as they liked their group plan, and if they don’t, their employers will hear about it. Why would the Trump administration be interested in HRAs? How does it fit with their broader approach to health care? In some ways it is incongruous because the administration has taken a number of actions and advocated for others which most people would construe as being designed to undermine the ACA in general and the individual market in particular. Yet the success of this new rule depends on a well-functioning individual market. If you can get past that inconsistency, this probably appeals to a desire to increase flexibility for small employers, who will probably be most interested in this opportunity, at least initially. What are the implications for the health insurance market? Looking at the medium to longer run, the only way the individual market will really grow is if there is migration from group. So in that sense, this is potentially a big deal. But even under the best-case scenario, it will be a multi-year process. The timeline to 2020 is extremely tight, and implementation will be very challenging in the short run. Employers are cautious with benefits, so I wouldn’t expect a huge acceleration of this right out of the gate. But the longer-term implications could be significant, because many people like the idea of a direct-to-consumer market for health insurance, and directionally, this is the kind of thing that needs to happen to bring that to scale.

'Love & Hip Hop' star Yandy Smith-Harris was on the front lines of protests taking place in NYC over inhumane prison conditions -- and she got pepper sprayed in the process. The reality TV star -- whose husband, Mendeecees Harris, is currently locked up in the New York prison system -- led a rally Sunday outside of Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ... where inmates have reportedly been without electricity and heat for days now. It's a remarkable scene. Yandy uses a speaker system to ask prisoners if they've been given blankets or if their toilets work yet, to which they respond no by banging on the windows. Later, you see Yandy and other protesters rush the building, demanding to see their loved ones ... only to be driven out by pepper spray from the guards inside. It’s gotten dark outside of MDC Brooklyn Detention Center and it’s evident there’s no electricity. People are waving flashlights out of dark windows. #UntilThereIsHeat pic.twitter.com/cuorEZNsTo Protests have been going on since at least Saturday, if not earlier, as families of prisoners have flooded the streets near MDC, demanding supplies be sent and that the power system quickly be restored. Prisoners have been using flashlights to signal for help at night. The Federal Bureau of Prisons says a fire destroyed an electrical panel inside and prevented access to backup generators. It's unclear when power and heat is set to be back on. New York City is sending trucks with hundreds of blankets and hand warmers to the Metropolitan Detention Center NOW and generators are being readied for transport. We've told the Federal Bureau of Prisons the supplies are coming – whether they like it or not. The civil unrest did not go unnoticed on a city level. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday that blankets and hand warmers were being sent to the prison, no matter what. As to how bad conditions inside really are, law enforcement sources directly connected to MDC tell us inmates have been peeing in water bottles and using those for warmth. We're told prison officials have been hesitant to let prisoners out of their cells out of fear for potential riots.

819,819,20-11-17 15:32,2017,11,20,Laura McGann,New York Times’ Glenn Thrush has a history of bad judgment with young female reporters,"Sexual harassment claims against yet another powerful man in media inspired New York Times White House correspondent Glenn Thrush to post an impassioned note on his Facebook page in October, calling on his fellow journalists to stand by women entering the field. In the post, which linked to an article about the latest accusations against political journalist Mark Halperin, Thrush wrote, “Young people who come into a newsroom deserve to be taught our trade, given our support and enlisted in our calling — not betrayed by little men who believe they are bigger than the mission.” It was a noble statement — but some Washington journalists I spoke to say it rings hollow, given Thrush’s own behavior with young women in the industry. “He kept saying he’s an advocate for women and women journalists,” a 23-year-old woman told me, recounting an incident with Thrush from this past June. “That’s how he presented himself to me. He tried to make himself seem like an ally and a mentor.” She paused. “Kind of ironic now.” Thrush, 50, is one of the New York Times’s star White House reporters whose chronicles of the Trump administration recently earned him and his frequent writing partner Maggie Haberman a major book deal. Thrush and the young woman met at her colleague’s going-away party at a bar near the Politico newsroom, she told me, and shared a few rounds of drinks in a booth. The night, she said, ended on a Washington street corner, where Thrush left her in tears after she resisted his advances. The encounter was troubling enough to the woman that her friend Bianca Padró Ocasio, also 23 and a journalist, confronted Thrush about his behavior via text message the next day. “I want to make sure you don’t lure young women aspiring journalists into those situations ever again,” she texted. “So help me out here. How can I do that?” Thrush was apologetic but defensive. “I don’t lure anybody ever,” he wrote, according to screenshots provided by Padró Ocasio. “I got drunk because I got some shitty health news. And I am acutely aware of the hurdles that young women face in this business and have spent the better part of 20 years advocating for women journalists.” If Thrush is acutely aware of what young women face in the business of political journalism, he should also know it’s because he himself is one of the problems women face. Five years ago, when Thrush and I were colleagues at Politico, I was in the same bar as Padró Ocasio’s friend — perhaps the same booth — when he caught me off guard, put his hand on my thigh, and suddenly started kissing me. Thrush says that he recalls the incident differently. Three young women I interviewed, including the young woman who met Thrush in June, described to me a range of similar experiences, from unwanted groping and kissing to wet kisses out of nowhere to hazy sexual encounters that played out under the influence of alcohol. Each woman described feeling differently about these experiences: scared, violated, ashamed, weirded out. I was — and am — angry. Details of their stories suggest a pattern. All of the women were in their 20s at the time. They were relatively early in their careers compared to Thrush, who was the kind of seasoned journalist who would be good to know. At an event with alcohol, he made advances. Afterward, they (as I did) thought it best to stay on good terms with Thrush, whatever their feelings. “I apologize to any woman who felt uncomfortable in my presence, and for any situation where I behaved inappropriately. Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected or uncomfortable is unacceptable,” Thrush said in a statement emailed to me on November 19. In interviews with about 40 people in and around media who know Thrush, I got a picture of a reporter whose title doesn’t capture his power and stature. People who’ve worked with him say he can get a writer’s name in front of the right editor, if he wants. Newsroom leaders care what he thinks. Some reporters said Thrush had used his connections to help them land jobs or develop new sources. The downfall of Hollywood titan Weinstein has been a catalyst for a movement to stamp out workplace harassment, particularly the variety that pits powerful men against much less powerful women. They are facing consequences for their behavior like never before, including men in media. Halperin lost a coveted book deal. NPR news chief Michael Oreskes resigned. Leon Wieseltier lost funding for his new magazine. And Lockhart Steele, the editorial director of Vox Media, Vox’s parent company, was fired for misconduct. Thrush wasn’t my boss at Politico. He was a reporter and I was an editor. We were on different teams and hardly crossed each other’s paths. But he was an incredibly influential person in the newsroom and in political journalism, a world I was still trying to break into in a meaningful way at the time. It wasn’t that Thrush was offering young women a quid pro quo deal, such as sex in exchange for mentorship. Thrush, just by his stature, put women in a position of feeling they had to suck up and move on from an uncomfortable encounter. On that night five years ago, I joined Thrush and a handful of other reporters for a few rounds at the Continental, a Politico hangout in Rosslyn, Virginia. At first, nothing seemed strange, until the crowd had dwindled down to Thrush, me, and one other female colleague. Thrush tossed a $20 bill at her and told her to take a cab and leave us, “the grown-ups,” alone. He slid into my side of the booth, blocking me in. I was wearing a skirt, and he put his hand on my thigh. He started kissing me. I pulled myself together and got out of there, shoving him on my way out. In the morning, Thrush sent me an apologetic email. I didn’t save it, but I recall it as similar to the one he would later send to Padró Ocasio’s friend in June. He said he was sorry, but he didn’t say for what, exactly. A few hours later, I saw him in deep conversation with a number of men I worked with. My gut told me something was up. I worried he was covering his tracks by spreading a rosy version of the night. As many people told me in the course of reporting this story, Thrush is a talker — or, as many put it, “a bullshitter.” He likes to hear gossip, and he likes to spread it. Gradually, things in the office started to change for me. Certain men in the newsroom, I thought, started to look at me differently. Some of their comments seemed a bit too familiar or were outright offensive. I had a nagging sense that I just wasn’t as respected as I used to be. I started to think maybe I shouldn’t be in journalism if I couldn’t hang in a tough newsroom. I found myself on edge, nervous and anxious all the time. I started to believe I had brought this all on myself. In the course of reporting this story, I was told by a male reporter who’d worked at Politico at the time that my instinct was right. He said that the day after that night at the bar, Thrush told him about the incident, except with the roles reversed. I had come onto him, the reporter said Thrush told him, and he had gently shut it down. In a statement, Thrush denied that he disparaged me to colleagues at Politico. He said that “the encounter described [in this story] was consensual, brief, and ended by me.” The source said that Thrush frequently told versions of this story with different young women as the subject. He would talk up a night out drinking with a young attractive woman, usually a journalist. Then he’d claim that she came onto him. In his version of these stories, Thrush was the responsible grown-up who made sure nothing happened. There was no conventional HR office at Politico at the time (a VP of human resources position was created there in 2016). So I brought my concern about the night to an experienced colleague right after the incident. When I believed rumors were damaging my standing in the office a few months later, I told a very senior editor. I was under the impression that nothing could be done. A spokesperson for POLITICO Brad Dayspring emphasized that no formal complaint ever reached the general counsel’s desk and that both the colleague and senior editor in question had left POLITICO years ago. One former Politico staffer told me that she’d become worried about her reputation after an encounter with Thrush sometime in the winter of 2012-’13. The scene was, again, a Politico going-away party. She said she and Thrush spoke most of the night, until they ended up the last two of the party left in the bar. She says she’d had a lot to drink and Thrush offered her a ride home. Her recollection of the details is fuzzy, but one way or another, he ended up in her place. “I had alcohol blur,” she says. But Thrush was far from being the grown-up who prevented things from going too far; instead, she says, she was the one to raise objections. “I remember stopping him at one point and saying, ‘Wait, you’re married.’” After that, she says, he left almost immediately. “I remember that by the time he left, I didn’t have much clothes on.” The woman says she was struggling at Politico at the time, and she wondered if gossip might have made her situation worse. “I don’t know if he told other male reporters or editors. Did that shade their opinion of me? There’s no way to know.” She says she doesn’t believe she was pressured or that she’s a victim. But she also says she wants others to know about what happened. “The only regret I have is not telling more women. I told two. What if I had told five?” One of the two women she told at the time shared with me her recollection of the conversation. “I remember she kept reemphasizing that they were both really drunk, that it was consensual,” the friend said. “And she did not believe it was an assault. But I do remember she was very rattled and upset and ashamed of what she saw as her role in it.” Another woman described to me a 2013 Politico party that she attended in her early 20s. She said she was standing alone, Thrush came up to talk to her, and suddenly he leaned in and landed a wet kiss on her ear. “It all happened very quickly. And he leaned in very quickly,” she said. “At the time, I remember thinking … adults sometimes kiss each other on the cheek. Then sometimes they miss and slobber on your ear. It was my way of thinking this wasn't as weird as I thought.” A 21-year-old woman arrived in Washington last year to intern in a journalism organization. She heard from people who don’t even work with Thrush to be careful. An employee at the Washington Post told her about him when she first arrived. A few months later, she says, a reporter at Roll Call warned her about him, too. She passed on the intel to four other female interns. Multiple young women journalists I spoke to said that they’d heard serious warnings about Thrush from friends. The word among women just starting in Washington, they said, is to be careful if you meet him at an event with alcohol, or if he sends you a direct message on Twitter. (Thrush suspended his Twitter account in September, saying it was too much of a distraction.) There’s something endearing and inspiring about interns who self-organized to guard themselves and each other against advances offered under guise of praise and professional advice — but there’s also something sad about a world in which the savvy move is to teach a young woman not to trust an older man who has something nice to say about her work. And whispers don’t fix everything. When Bianca Padró Ocasio’s friend found herself at the bar with Thrush in June, with him asking her to leave and go to another bar with him, she went to the bathroom and texted Padró Ocasio and another female friend, both of whom were also in journalism. “I’m drunk,” she texted, as saved screenshots of the messages show. “I’m nervous about this Glenn situation.” The friends urged her to call an Uber. “I am,” she responded. “I need to go home.” “Who else is there??” one friend asked. “Is there a woman you can uber home with?” Instead, the woman ended up leaving the bar with Thrush, who suggested they walk off some of their drinking — get some fresh air. He repeatedly tried to take her hand as they walked, she recalls, but she kept pulling it away. They crossed the Key Bridge from the Virginia neighborhood where Politico’s office is located into Georgetown. He led her down an incline to a dimly lit path along the old C&O Canal bed. He kissed her, she says, and she panicked. Then her phone rang, jolting her. It was Padró Ocasio. “I felt very protective of her,” Padró Ocasio said, describing the call. “I thought, she’s drunk right now. If I don’t do something, I’m not going to forgive myself.” The young woman ordered an Uber — the receipt shows it was about 11 pm — and says she planned to call Padró Ocasio back once inside the car. In the few minutes she waited, she said, Thrush walked back over to her and started to kiss her again. She began to cry. When Thrush saw, he abruptly walked off, waving his hand flippantly, and left her alone to wait for her ride, she said. Padró Ocasio’s friend received an email from Thrush the next morning with the subject line, “Nice meeting you!” followed by, “(And apologies?).” She responded congenially. “It was nice meeting you too! (And no worries haha).” She also met him a few weeks later at a tea shop near the White House, a meeting they’d discussed the night at the bar. Thrush sent her a few critiques of her stories. She said she feels that despite her misgivings, she has to stay on good terms with him since he is connected. “I hate feeling obligated to make him think I think everything is fine,” she said. “It’s been this thing hanging over me. I feel like I have to be nice to this person just because he knows people.” In his emailed statement, Thrush said that the night in June with the young woman was the last time he’s had a drink. He wrote: The June incident [described above] was a life-changing event [for me]. The woman involved was upset by my actions and for that I am deeply sorry. Over the past several years, I have responded to a succession of personal and health crises by drinking heavily. During that period, I have done things that I am ashamed of, actions that have brought great hurt to my family and friends. I have not taken a drink since June 15, 2017, have resumed counseling and will soon begin out-patient treatment for alcoholism. I am working hard to repair the damage I have done. In the course of his text dialogue with Padró Ocasio about the incident with her friend, Thrush wrote, “I feel really strongly about not creating a toxic environment.” Back at Politico years ago, Thrush’s behavior contributed to a toxic environment I experienced. Dozens of people told me that Politico has changed dramatically since Carrie Budoff Brown took over a year ago as the publication’s editor. Multiple men and women who work for her say her standards are high and she has no time for the kind of behavior I described. Budoff Brown was at the going-away party in June where Thrush was in the booth with the 23-year-old woman. She told me she noticed them talking but, like other attendees I talked to, she didn’t know that anything happened afterward. “I was disappointed in Glenn but had no reason to think that anything would progress beyond the bar that night,” she said. “And I am saddened to learn in the course of your reporting that it did.” “Great journalism and great business require a great workplace. My colleagues and I have worked hard to nurture a newsroom where people are supportive, good to each other, and where mutual respect is the way of life. We have zero tolerance for anything else.” By the time of the June incident, Thrush was gone from Politico anyway — off to the New York Times, which has hired many of Politico’s top reporters over the years. But now he will be on hiatus pending a Times investigation that was sparked by my reporting for this story. ""The behavior attributed to Glenn in this Vox story is very concerning and not in keeping with the standards and values of The New York Times,” said Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president of communications for the New York Times, in a written statement. “We intend to fully investigate and while we do, Glenn will be suspended. We support his decision to enter a substance abuse program.

821,821,07-12-18 21:22,2018,12,7,Syreeta McFadden,"In Life and After Her Death, Sandra Bland Taught Others About Activism","In the months prior to her death, Sandra Bland began making short videos speaking her truth to power and sharing them directly to Facebook. “I’m here to change to history,” Bland declared in her first recording in early January 2015. Here, the audience sees Bland up close and unvarnished, yet confident and resolute-looking directly at you, “This thing I’m holding in my hand, this telephone, this camera, is quite powerful.” In the new HBO Original Documentary,  Say Her Name: The Life and Death of Sandra Bland, which premiered on Monday, audiences are re-introduced to Sandra Bland in her own voice, using archival video from her personal activist project “Sandy Speaks.” Bland’s own voice frames her story in the hands of filmmakers Kate Davis and David Heilbroner who juxtapose it against the larger mystery surrounding her death in a Waller County, Texas jail—and a local justice system bent on absolving itself of all responsibility for the placing her there in the first place. On July 10, 2015, Bland was pulled over for a minor traffic violation (failure to signal a lane change) by then Texas Department of Safety Trooper Brian T. Encinia. Dashcam video presented a tense exchange between Bland and Encinia. An audibly irritated Bland asked questions regarding the cause for the stop as an even more irritable, then aggressive, Encinia escalated the encounter, forcing Bland out of her car, then pushing her head to the ground. In a separate video recorded by a bystander, we see Bland in handcuffs thanking the cameraperson as she is escorted into a squad car that would take her to a Waller County jail. It is the last instance we would hear Bland’s voice. Three days later, Bland was found dead in her holding cell. She was 28 years old. We think we know her story. For Bland’s sisters, Sharon Cooper and Shanté Needham, the documentary successfully renders a complete portrait of their sister, a woman who had always had a voice and had honed that voice growing up in a household of five sisters—women—who are all outspoken. “This documentary humanizes her,” said Needham to Broadly in a recent phone interview. “That she was a person. She was loved. She was my mother’s daughter. She was a sister. She was aunt. She was a cousin. She was just loved by very nice church family… along with several different friend and people who were following her before we knew they were following her ‘Sandy Speaks’ videos.”  Say Her Name: The Life and Death of Sandra Bland now joins a canon of documentaries released over the last three years that center local stories of the most visible cases in the movement for Black lives. This feature-length documentary is the first of these narratives that centers on an African American woman’s death at the hands of police. These victims, whose names are recited in protests like rosaries, serve as proxies in the long struggle to reform policies of policing and criminal justice writ large. However, notably African American women, who coined the term that became a movement—Black Lives Matter—and often are on the front lines of protest and civic action in confronting state violence against Black communities, are too often invisible (or worse, ignored) when they themselves are victims from national attention and fervor of protests. In early 2015, the African American Policy Forum launched a social media campaign, #SayHerName and released a report drawing attention to the acute experiences of state violence by Black women. The greater impact of documentaries like these aims to correct the narrative, to humanize the beloved, whose image and very personhood has been distorted in the public imagination. Davis and Heilbroner attempt to reconstruct a clear line of events leading up Bland’s death and its aftermath while balancing the story of two Blands—the Sandy her family knew against a version that Waller County officials constructed. County Sheriff R. Glenn Smith and District Attorney Elton Mathis, in interviews, methodically recount a tale of a woman unrecognizable to her family and friends, of a woman who was terrified, abandoned by her family, aggravated, and unstable whom they believed took her own life. Yet, details presented in the film complicate their neat explanation. Bland had been in touch with her family to secure bail. Bland recently secured a job with her alma mater Prairie View A&M University. And there is still the matter of her modest activist project, “Sandy Speaks” which show an energized woman offering insight to all within earshot. Still, national media from the onset, abstracted Bland, readily consuming Texas official accounts at face value. The film underscores the problem that families face in their quest for answers in these tragedies—that they are constantly racing against the law enforcement’s account, fighting to preserve the humanity of their lives in the public record. “I think that whether or not it was their intent, I think they did an excellent job of showing their inability to do their role effectively,” Cooper said of Waller County officials in a phone interview with Broadly. “I think that they validated the doubt that was cast upon the information they were sharing with us. I just think that they presented themselves in a way that was inconsistent with things that were shared with us previously.” County officials, in the family’s view, were duplicitous and not transparent. County officials neglected to contact Bland’s mother, Geneva Reed-Veal, listed as her next of kin. She learned of her youngest daughter’s death through a phone call by a relative. At one moment, viewers recognize the startling symmetries between Reed-Veal, a Black mother from Chicago bringing back the body of her dead child from some small southern town as Mamie Till did sixty years ago. “I think that why people will resonate with the film is that they will very much see themselves in Sandy. Specifically, Black women,” Cooper said. “They will see their mother or their aunt or their sister or their sister-friend, who they’ve had conversations with.” With “Sandy Speaks,"" Bland had quietly built a following through her social media. Activated by the movement for Black lives—where in the year preceding she witnessed sustained activism and mounting political pressure nationwide— Bland wanted to confront what felt like a pandemic of deaths of unarmed African American civilians at the hands of police. In the summer of 2014, the high-profile killings of John Crawford III in Ohio, Eric Garner in New York City, and teen Michael Brown in Missouri brought the issue of police brutality to a bubbling forefront. There were protests and demands for accountability, if not punishment, for police officers who killed. Yet, for Bland, her intention in generating video posts were to speak directly to people traumatized by racialized violence between communities of color and police. As part of her own re-education on matters of police reform and social justice, Bland researched these issues, presented to her church’s pastor in Chicago with a two-and-half-inch binder containing that research on police brutality. She said she had found her calling. “She had a way of giving you a blueprint on how to dig yourself out of it and how to turn that rage into something that is purposeful and impactful,” Cooper said. While no one would be held criminally liable for Bland’s death, Encinia and Waller County Sheriff’s officials made a settlement with Bland’s family for $1.9 million in a civil suit. In 2017, the Texas State legislature passed the Sandra Bland Act, a mental health mandate for treatment and bond provisions, that called for an independent investigation of jail deaths of the mentally ill. But the law eliminated many key provisions, namely the most important condition for the family, which was statewide de-escalation training for law enforcement officers. Cooper, in 2017, called the deletions “gut-wrenching.” “What’s a bill with her name attached to it, if the very thing [that's not addressed] is the reason she is no longer here,” Needham said. To this end, the family plans to continue to work with local activists to advocate for a new state law to include training. For the family, the answer regarding Bland’s death remains unsettled. For Needham, it is a condition she is resigned to accept, “I think, unfortunately, we have to move past that because we will never get those answers unless some good ol’ old person, by time, gets close to 90 [years old and] decides that they don’t want to go on with this truth that they’ve been holding in since 2015.” Her answer echoes the resignation of surviving family members of lynchings, who wait in vain in many instances for truth or consciousness of white people to reveal that had been known and hidden from view. What remains clear is that Sandra Bland likely would be alive today, had she not been pulled over in the first place, and further, if Encinia had not escalated the stop and issued a warning instead. Bland’s arrest, incarceration, and death are all ensnared in an interconnected justice system where too many actors still harbor implicit biases. This fact is underscored in the film as activist, Hannah Brommer, reaches her—and by extension viewers—logical conclusion, “Therefore, racism killed Sandra Bland.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepqyk/sandra-bland-documentary-hbo,Identity,Vice

823,823,06-06-19 00:00,2019,6,6,Caroline Copley,Will Europe's clampdown on faulty medical devices hurt patients?,"BERLIN (Reuters) - When a Californian company founded by a U.S. veteran wounded in Afghanistan sought to register a new medical device this year, it turned to Europe before the United States. The European approvals system had long been quicker, the company said, but the introduction of new rules is changing all that.  “Now it has flipped,” said Bill Colone, CEO of San Clemente-based Spinal Singularity, which hopes to launch a ‘smart’ catheter for men with spinal injuries or disease early next year after squeezing in its application under the old European rules.  Colone is part of a chorus of industry voices warning that a switch to stricter European rules governing medical devices, due to come into force a year from now, will slow or even halt the release of products in Europe that could transform patients’ lives.  Defenders of the regulations say they will not significantly complicate the process and are vital to prevent problems like rupturing silicone breast implants and debris from all-metal hip implants damaging tissue and bones.  Many patient advocates say the new rules do not go far enough to reform a European system in which a top U.S. official suggested in 2011 patients may be ""guinea pigs"" here. The comment drew a sharp response from the European Union, which still firmly rejects that characterization.  That transatlantic spat, and the subsequent evolution of medical device certification around the world, are part of a wider global struggle by governments to attract businesses seeking light-touch regulation without scaring off their voters.  The new medical devices rules agreed by the European Union in 2017 will tighten control of devices before they come to market, improve transparency and strengthen surveillance by national authorities, a European Commission spokesperson said.  The new system changes less than some proposals - which envisaged regulation by a public body, along U.S. lines, replacing the existing practice of certification by profit-making private firms.  But players in medical technology - which ranges from surgical implants to scans - say it is too burdensome and is being built too slowly, risking not only hampering innovation but also harming patients by interrupting supplies.  “Immediate action is needed now to avoid severe disruption of product supply to patients and hospitals,” seven European Associations said in a joint statement last week.  All 55,000 devices certified under the old directives have to be re-certified along with other products such as reusable scalpels, nasal saline sprays and dental imaging software.  The industry says there are not enough Notified Bodies - the private firms charged with certifying the safety of devices ranging from bandages to pacemakers, and that manufacturers may have to take products off the market or delay new launches.  The situation is further complicated by Brexit, with Britain’s BSI one of just two notified bodies to have got the go-ahead to certify devices under the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR). If Britain leaves the EU in October without a deal, certificates issued by British bodies would be invalid.  Germany, home to Europe’s biggest medtech sector, is pressing the European Commission to smooth the transition, suggesting three solutions to overcome any Brexit-related supply problems in a March 27 letter to the Commission seen by Reuters.  These include giving firms 12 more months to sell products in the EU in the case of a disorderly Brexit, as long as they plan how to regain compliance, the letter from German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.  Trade groups have suggested delaying implementation of the rules beyond May 2020 or faster designation of notified bodies.  The European Commission rejects the need for contingency plans and said it was focusing on a timely implementation of the regulation, which includes requirements for manufacturers to monitor product safety once devices are on the market.  More than 20 notified bodies could be accredited by the end of the year, it said.  This is around a third of the number of firms currently certified to assess medical products. “That is a massive reduction in capacity when adding a considerable volume of work,” said Gary Slack, senior vice president for global medical devices at the notified body BSI.  To hedge against any Brexit risk, BSI has set up a subsidiary in Amsterdam and has transferred most of its clients’ certificates there, but is still waiting for its Dutch body to be certified under the MDR.  For Medtech conglomerates with thousands of devices, the bill to meet the new regulations could stretch into the millions of dollars - especially for those that make riskier devices.  Smith and Nephew, which manufacturers hip and knee implants, put its MDR compliance costs at $15-$20 million for 2018 and around $60 million this year.  As a result of the regulation, more than 55 percent of those surveyed by Germany industry association ZVEI said they would reduce the number of products on offer.  The Commission said many products are eligible for a so-called ‘grace period’ which means they can be sold under the old rules until May 2024 at the latest if certificates are reissued, something BSI said many firms are rushing to do.  But the other certified body, Germany’s Tuev-Sued, said many manufacturers had yet to catch on to the regulatory changes. “We are definitely expecting chaotic years,” said Bassil Akra, Tuev-Sued’s vice president in charge of medtech.  The medical technology industry is worth $129 billion and employs 675,000 people in Europe, according to MedTech Europe.  Experts agree that many new devices are invaluable to patients, but the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists said in November that faulty ones were linked to 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths over the past decade.  A key part of the new regulation is how much access doctors and patients will have to the pan-European Eudamed database, to strengthen surveillance and prevent repeated adverse incidents. A Commission spokesperson said discussions were ongoing with authorities, patient groups and other stakeholders.  While medtech giants like Siemens Healthineers and Germany’s Fresenius have the regulatory staff to navigate the new rules, most firms are much smaller and will struggle, said MedTech Europe CEO Serge Bernasconi.  Spinal Singularity said it had managed to apply under the old system by hiring contractors to help it submit all the paperwork to a notified body by May 27 - two months before it had planned. It is hoping for certification by the end of the year, but is dreading renewing it in four years’ time because of what he said were many “incredibly burdensome” new requirements.  German surgical instrument maker Asanus said it plans to take around five highly-innovative surgical products off the market and will discontinue several hundred minimally-invasive devices, as well as stop new development in this area.  “If the paperwork costs for the product are five times the amount you can achieve in sales, you simply won’t do it anymore,” said Chief Executive Armin Schorer, who expects many smaller makers of lower risk devices to shut up shop.  Bernasconi and Colone said start-ups are now looking to launch their products in other markets, like the United States or China first, denying European patients access to innovations.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal body that approves medical devices, is toughening up its own approval process after faulty medical devices harmed patients there too. But Colone noted that was only for some products. His firm plans to file for U.S. approval this autumn.  “Because of the pending new EU MDR, overall the FDA process may even be slightly easier,” he said.  Kurt Racke, a medical ethics expert at Bonn University, said he did not think Europe’s new regulations would make it harder to win approvals than in the United States. “I think Europe has the most lax market for medical devices,” he said. “I don’t think so much will change there in principle.”  The European Commission rejects suggestions its rules are not tough enough. “The Commission takes patient safety very seriously,” a spokesperson said, “and has led various regulatory reforms to ensure the highest possible quality, safety and reliability of medical devices on the EU market.”  Reporting by Caroline Copley; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-medical-devices/insight-will-europes-clampdown-on-faulty-medical-devices-hurt-patients-idUSL5N2302OB,Health News,Reuters
824,824,16-05-17 15:11,2017,5,16,Julia Belluz,Minnesota is fighting its largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years. Blame vaccine deniers.,"Anti-vaccine groups have helped fuel Minnesota’s largest outbreak of measles in nearly 30 years, with 58 confirmed cases since the outbreak was identified in April. Most of the cases are occurring among unvaccinated Somali-American children in Minneapolis, whose parents have been the targets of anti-vaccine propagandists, according to the state health department. One of the most noteworthy fearmongerers is Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor who introduced the bogus idea that vaccines and autism are linked in a paper in a 1998 The Lancet study. (Since then, the paper has been retracted, Wakefield has lost his medical license, and studies in thousands of children have shown the vaccine is safe.) Along with other vaccine deniers, Wakefield has continued to spread fears about the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine through public lectures and outreach campaigns in Minnesota over the past several years, according to reports in the Star Tribune. He also defended his fearmongering in the Washington Post by saying he’s just giving concerned parents information they want. Because measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man, health officials are bracing for more cases. Here are seven facts to know about the virus. If you were born before 1960, you might have come down with a measles infection. In the US, before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were 4 million measles cases with 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths every year. That's just a massive burden of illness. By 2000, because of widespread vaccination, the virus was declared eliminated in the United States: Enough people were immunized that outbreaks were uncommon, and deaths from measles were scarcely heard of. Since then, however, public health officials have documented several measles outbreaks — a trend that that seems to be tied to some parents opting out of vaccines for their kids because of safety fears. In 2014, US health officials recorded more than 660 cases of measles — the largest outbreak of the past decade — many of them linked to a community of Amish people in Ohio who were refusing vaccines. In 2015, an outbreak originating at Disneyland in California helped spark nearly 150 cases — another widespread outbreak linked to vaccine denialism. Now, there’s the outbreak in Minnesota. About 10 years ago, fears among Somali Americans that autism seemed to be disproportionately striking their children led to a University of Minnesota project on autism prevalence in the community. The researchers found that kids of Somali descent weren’t more likely than white children to have the disorder — but the concerns about autism were enough to open the door to anti-vaccine views. Since 2008, the vaccination rate among Somali-American children has plummeted while remaining stable among non-Somali kids. Health officials haven’t yet identified patient zero in the current outbreak, though measles outbreaks in the US often originate with an infected traveler who brings the virus to an unvaccinated community. Meanwhile, Somalia has been stricken with its own measles outbreaks and low rates of vaccination — but these trends are being driven by a lack of vaccine access because of famine and drought. There is some irony in the fact that immigrants and their families in the US are being persuaded not to take advantage of life-saving immunizations that their relatives back home may not be able to access. Large-scale studies involving thousands of participants in several countries have failed to establish a link between the MMR vaccine and the mental developmental disorder. A study in the journal JAMA looked at nearly 100,000 children who got the shot and their family histories of autism. The researchers found the MMR vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of autism, even with children who had older siblings with the disorder. ""These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD,"" the researchers concluded. In another of the most thorough studies to date, nearly half a million kids who got the vaccine were compared with some 100,000 who didn't, and there were no differences in the autism rates between the two groups. ""This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism,"" the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. Studies published in The Lancet, The Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, PLOS One, and The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, among others, have also found no association between the vaccine and autism. After an incubation period of 10 to 12 days, measles comes on as a fever, cough, stuffy nose, and bloodshot and watery eyes. Loss of appetite and malaise are common, too. Several days after these initial symptoms, an uncomfortable spotty, rash begins to spread all over the body, starting on the face and neck, and moving downward. The rash usually lasts for three to five days and then fades away. In uncomplicated cases, people who get measles start to recover as soon as the rash appears and feel back to normal in about two to three weeks. But up to 40 percent of patients have complications from the virus. These usually occur in the very young (children under five), in adults over 20, and in anybody else who is undernourished or otherwise immunocompromised. Children under five have the highest probability of death. The most common complication from the measles is pneumonia, which accounts for most measles-related deaths. Less frequently, measles can lead to blindness, croup, mouth ulcers, ear infections, or severe diarrhea. Some children develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain), which can lead to convulsions, loss of hearing, and mental retardation. Again, these complications mostly arise in people whose immune systems are already weakened because of their age, preexisting diseases, or malnutrition. According to the CDC, the horrible mathematics of measles looks like this: One out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia; one in 1,000 will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain); one or two in 1,000 children will die. Doctors can help patients avoid the more severe complications (blindness, pneumonia) by making sure patients have good nutrition and enough fluids. For eye and ear infections that can arise, doctors can prescribe antibiotics. And because measles depletes its victims' vitamin A levels, doctors usually give patients two doses of vitamin A supplements. Measles is prevented through the combination MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) shot. The CDC recommends that children get two doses: Immunity from the vaccine lasts for decades, but you should ask your health provider about booster shots if you’re an adult. The vaccine is known to be extremely safe and very effective: it contains a live but weakened version of the virus, and it causes your immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. Should you be exposed to actual measles, those antibodies will then fire up to protect against the disease. Again, side effects are rare and mostly very mild. According to the CDC, for example, fevers after the MMR vaccine occur in one out of six people, and mild rashes, in one in 20. More severe problems are virtually nonexistent: serious allergic reactions happen in fewer than one in a million cases. Deafness, long-term seizures, and permanent brain damage are ""so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine."" So the benefits of the vaccine — the protection of children and the communities they live in — vastly outweigh the harms. If you’re not vaccinated, it’s extremely easy to get measles. In an unimmunized population, one person with measles can infect 12 to 18 others. That's way higher than other scary viruses like Ebola, HIV or SARS. (With Ebola, one case usually leads to two others. With HIV and SARS, one case leads to another four.) Measles is an airborne virus, transmitted by respiratory droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person, it’s usually shared through coughing or sneezing. Small particle aerosols from someone with measles can stay suspended in the air for long periods of time after they’ve left a room, and the virus can live on surfaces for up to two hours. So a person with measles can cough in a room, leave, and hours later, someone else could catch the virus from the droplets in the air (unless they were vaccinated). No other virus can do that. What worries health officials is that the measles virus can spread in a person four days before the onset of the telltale rash. So people with the virus start being contagious before they’d ever know they had measles. (They stop being contagious about four days after the rash appears.) In exceptionally rare cases, even if you are vaccinated, you can still get measles. In fewer than five percent of vaccinated people, their immune systems just don't kick in even with the shots. Researchers aren't sure why. Getting only one dose of the vaccine instead of the recommended two also seems to increase people's chances of getting measles if they're ever exposed. Let’s be clear about something up front: Most American children still get their shots. More than 90 percent of kids receive vaccines for polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and chickenpox, though the coverage rates are slightly lower for other routine vaccines. Most American parents also say they support school-based vaccine requirements. States started to mandate that school children get inoculated against diseases because we need vaccination rates to remain high to sustain what’s called “herd immunity.” For any vaccine to be effective and prevent outbreaks, a certain (high) percentage of people in a population need to be immunized. This keeps diseases from spreading easily and keeps vulnerable groups that can't be vaccinated protected (such as very young babies or people with allergies to vaccines). And yet, since vaccination was invented more than 200 years ago, anti-vaxxers have been organizing. So how great is their influence? And is it growing stronger? In the past couple of years, there haven’t been any new peer-reviewed studies on national trends in vaccine refusal. But the latest evidence we have from individual states, in combination with older studies on vaccine coverage rates and recent surveys of doctors, suggest there’s a growing problem in several parts of the country. The main way to measure how many kids aren’t getting vaccinated by choice is finding out which proportion of kids get exempted from school vaccine requirements for nonmedical — that is, personal belief or religious — reasons. Since immunization laws are state-based, there’s variation across the country when it comes to the requirements. As of August 2016, all 50 states have legislation requiring vaccines for students — but almost every state allows exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations, and 18 states grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs (with the exception of Mississippi, California, and West Virginia, which have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation). Leah Samuel of Stat News crunched the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on nonmedical exemptions from 2009 to 2016. (Her numbers weren’t peer-reviewed, however, like some of the other studies I’ll describe next.) She found that the volume of people seeking exemptions was greater in 2016 than at any other point since 2009 in 11 states: Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia. She also found the national average for nonmedical exemptions was down in 2016 from a 2009 spike — a fact she attributes to California and Vermont’s 2015 cancellation of their personal belief exemptions. Some of the best peer-reviewed evidence for an increase in the number of people refusing or delaying vaccines comes from Emory researcher Saad Omer. In one 2009 New England Journal of Medicine paper, Omer looked at the state-level rates of nonmedical exemptions. He found that between 1991 and 2004, those rates increased from less than 0.98 percent to about 1.5 percent. Again, this uptick was not spread evenly across the US, and even varied within states. Generally, though, states that allowed only religious exemptions had a steady opt-out rate of about 1 percent during the period (1991 to 2004). But in states that were more lax — allowing philosophical or personal belief exemptions as well as religious and medical exemptions — the mean exemption rate increased from 0.99 to 2.54 percent. In a 2012 follow-up to that paper, also published in NEJM, Omer found — once again — that “non-medical exemptions have continued to increase, and the rate of increase has accelerated.” Doctors are also reporting that they’re meeting more and more parents who are skeptical of vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics periodically surveys its members and identified a rise in pediatricians reporting that they had patients who refused a vaccine — from 75 percent in 2006 to 87 percent in 2013. As for state-level analyses, Baylor researcher Peter Hotez looked at the rate of nonmedical exemptions over the past 13 years in his home state of Texas. He found that in 2016, there were almost 45,000 children who refused vaccines — about double the number of exemptions in 2010 and a 19-fold increase compared with 2003. Texas is one of those lax states that allow parents to get both religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions. And other studies have shown that people who live in places that make it easy to opt out of vaccines tend to have higher rates of exemptions. One paper found that states that allowed parents to refuse vaccines for philosophical or personal reasons had exemption rates that were 2.54 times as high as states that only permitted religious exemptions. Another older study, looking at data between 1991 and 2004, found an increase in exemption rates only in states that allowed philosophical exemptions.",https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15577316/minnesota-measles-outbreak-explained,,Vox

But Floyd says life has gotten in the way ... and he's been spending way too much time focusing on his family and growing his real estate business. In fact, Floyd says he's a MAJOR investor in One Vanderbilt -- which he says will be the tallest skyscraper in New York. Floyd says he's got more than $100,000,000 invested in NYC real estate projects -- and that's more important to him right now than learning a new combat sport. The good news ... Floyd isn't completely closing the door on MMA, and insists he's keeping himself in shape just in case.

826,826,20-12-16 00:00,2016,12,20,Allison Meier,The Challenge of Making a Permanent Exhibit About Mercurial New York,"The Museum of the City of New York opens its first permanent exhibition, an ambitious multimedia journey through 400 years of the city’s turbulent history. In New York at Its Core at the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY), an 18th-century ankle cuff unearthed in Manhattan’s Hanover Square is installed alongside a glimmering 1770 silver coffeepot. Not everyone arrived in New York City by choice, nor did they necessarily arrive at all. Nearby is a 17th-century Lenape war club, newly returned to the city after centuries in Sweden. New York at Its Core opened November 18, filling 8,000 square feet of the MCNY first floor. It’s the first permanent exhibition at the museum, and the culmination of five years of research, as well as a decade-long $100 million renovation project. While the institution on the northeastern corner of Central Park is not geographically on the beaten tourist path, nor that of many New Yorkers, New York at Its Core is an ambitious experience that aims to be an accessible introduction to the inner core of the Big Apple. There is in fact an apple corer, a gargantuan early 20th-century metal device on loan from the collection of the Russ & Daughters appetizing store, as immigrant entrepreneur Joel Russ featured apples in his herring salad. Each of the roughly 450 artifacts on view, dating from Henry Hudson’s voyage in 1609 to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, is a fragment of a greater personal timeline in New York. “Each object is an entry point into a whole thread that relates to the city’s history, and all of these threads together add up to a whole that begins to capture what New York is about,” Sarah Henry, deputy director and chief curator at MCNY, told Hyperallergic. “We believe New York is too multifaceted to ingest in a quick 20 minute run through an exhibition. We wanted to create something that would reward multiple visits, but still be appreciated with a single visit. Our goal is for people to come away having better understood New York.” Part of that understanding isn’t just about the past, but what’s to come. The biggest of the exhibition’s three galleries is a flexible space called the Future City Lab, concentrating on the next 50 years of the city. A huge digital map, touchscreens, and an interactive streetscape-augmenting game fill the Lab, with the gallery design allowing for new data on population, climate change, and urban planning to update and alter the displays. In the two galleries devoted to history, you can also find these multimedia aspects. A parade of silhouettes, and freestanding totems, introduce visitors to 75 individuals that influenced the city, including artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, anarchist Emma Goldman, writer and activist Wong Chin Foo, Abstract Expressionist Lee Krasner, founding father Alexander Hamilton, poet Walt Whitman, hip-hop artist Jay Z, and a beaver, whose fur made for a very significant industry in the colonial era. “It was a humbling and daunting and exciting task to think about how to instill the story of New York into our space, although obviously the complexity of New York is something you could spend a lifetime delving into and not get to the bottom of it,” Henry said. “For us, it was important to have a point of view and a lens through which to look at this story. Our question is what makes New York New York, and we boil it down to four words: money, density, diversity, and creativity.” And all of these people and moments are basically presented on the same plane, even calamities like the September 11 attacks or the AIDS crisis, while addressed and explored, are not enshrined. Instead every broader event is distilled through a component of a human story. For example, rather than a didactic explanation of Boss Tweed’s catastrophic corruption, you can gaze at the glimmer of his T-shaped diamond cufflinks, bought with city money. Calvert Vaux’s 1865 field drafting set, used to design landscapes like Central Park, is positioned by fragments of glass, pottery, and a button exhumed from the remains of Seneca Village, the African-American enclave displaced by the Manhattan greenspace. A small Halvah tin from the Sahadi family recalls the Little Syria neighborhood that thrived in the future site of the World Trade Center. There are no generic objects, each is specific to a person in the place that is New York City. And each emphasizes how there is no single story of New York, yet it’s that diversity, whether religious, ethnic, or economic, that makes the fertile seeds of a city that continues to grow. New York at Its Core is now open at the Museum of the City of New York (1220 Fifth Avenue, East Harlem, Manhattan).",https://hyperallergic.com/341643/the-challenge-of-making-a-permanent-exhibit-about-mercurial-new-york/,,Hyperallergic
827,827,28-08-17 18:45,2017,8,28,Kelly Swanson,Report: Brexit strategist to help GOP with 2018 midterm election strategy,"One of the minds behind the Brexit campaign is reportedly helping Republicans strategize for the 2018 midterm elections. Back in 2015, the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU hired American PR strategist Gerry Gunster to help lead the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. Now, per Politico’s reporting, Gunster is “in discussions” with GOP leaders on how to tackle the 2018 midterm elections: Spearheading the discussions is Republican strategist Gerry Gunster, a referendum expert who helped to lead the successful 2016, populist-infused campaign for Britain's exit from the European Union. Gunster — who visited then-president-elect Trump in New York City along with Brexit leader Nigel Farage after the November election — has spoken about the ballot initiative concept with top administration aides, including political director Bill Stepien and Nick Ayers, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence and a veteran GOP operative. Gerry Gunster, who runs the US advocacy firm Goddard Gunster, was a top strategist in the campaign to convince British voters to approve leaving the European Union. Ultimately, 51.9 percent of British voters voted to leave the EU. The Brexit campaign has been criticized for its use of false statistics about the financial cost of Britain staying in the EU, which many say helped its victory. An article by the Telegraph identified several of the statistics pushed by the Brexit campaign as misleading and downright false. For example, the “Leave” camp claimed that the UK lost 350 million pounds (about $450 million) per week as a result of being in the EU, and pledged to invest that money in Britain’s health care system if the UK left. This was doubly wrong: The 350 million figure didn’t take into account money the EU paid back to Britain in subsidies, and the Brexit side quickly abandoned its promise to spend the 350 million on health care after they won the vote. Nonetheless, the GOP seems keen to draw on Gunster’s insights. Despite extensive gerrymandering that favors Republican victories around the country in 2018, the GOP has cause for concern for its incumbents’ and candidates’ prospects, including: Trump’s recent attacks on GOP leaders, the failed recent attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare that have reflected poorly on the party, and 2017 special elections results showing the Democratic Party closing its gap behind the GOP.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/28/16215666/brexit-strategist-republicans-2018-midterm-election-strategy,,Vox

829,829,27-09-16 14:34,2016,9,27,Andrew Prokop,Early polls and focus groups suggest Hillary Clinton won the debate,"It will be a few more days before we get methodologically rigorous polls measuring how the electorate felt about the first presidential debate. The indicators we have so far are necessarily incomplete and limited — they’re focus groups of tiny, hand-picked samples of undecided voters, polls of people who watched the debate rather than the electorate at large, and plain punditry. Still, what we have so far points toward a Hillary Clinton victory. We’ve got: Furthermore, and potentially even more important, pundits in the media are converging on the narrative that Clinton won and Trump lost. This initial evidence will confirm those spot judgments, and that could matter. As I wrote earlier this month, political science research indicates that media judgments about who ""won"" a debate could help influence voters’ perceptions of who won. Hillary Clinton has been sliding in the polls over the past few weeks, and the race has grown uncomfortably close for Democrats who were expecting a landslide just over a month ago. So it’s certainly possible that Clinton will gain a few points in the polls from her debate performance, if the broader electorate agrees (or becomes convinced) that she won. After all, that’s what appeared to happen with Mitt Romney, who got a bump of a few points in public polling after he was judged to have won the first debate in 2012. But there are a few reasons to be cautious about assuming this will be the case. First of all, voters are perfectly able to conclude that one candidate ""won"" the debate without necessarily being won over to his or her side. That’s just common sense. After all, many supporters of Barack Obama concluded that he lost that debate with Romney, but they didn’t abandon him in droves — Romney just got a few points closer. Second, as John Sides has written, the vast majority of people who watch these debates have already made up their minds. ""The debates tend to attract viewers who have an abiding interest in politics and are mostly party loyalists,"" Sides wrote. So it’s not clear what conclusions lower-information swing voters, who are less likely to have watched, will reach about what happened. Third, polls after certain events can be affected by a phenomenon called differential non-response rates, as Jeff Stein explained earlier this year. What this means, essentially, is that some voters may be more likely to even answer polls when they think things are going well for their preferred candidate. This means some Clinton supporters, because they got the sense that she won and feel excited, might be overrepresented in polls of the next few days. Conversely, some Trump supporters might not be in the mood to answer polls because they aren’t happy with how the debate went. Still, the initial indicators we have look good for Clinton, who was itching for some good news for her campaign. So we’ll see if more methodologically rigorous polls that come in later this week find that there was a serious impact on where the race stands.",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/27/13069088/hillary-clinton-won-first-presidential-debate,,Vox
830,830,19-06-19 00:00,2019,6,19,Evan McMorris-Santoro,"Marianne Williamson: Yes, Trump’s ICE Raids Are Exactly Like Nazi Germany","Democrats and Republicans debated this week just how to describe the massive immigration raids President Trump promised in a tweet this week.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired up Republicans when she called ICE detention centers “concentration camps” Tuesday. She refused demands that she apologize for the comment, leading to another round of Republican recriminations the next day. It was another episode of the classic American political game show “Who Said ‘Nazi?” It’s the IRL version of Godwin’s Law — the longer and more embittered a political fight in the U.S., the more likely someone will try to compare their opponents to the Nazis. Political professionals generally frown on these kind of comparisons. Invoking the Third Reich is tends to distract from the subject at hand, they say, and gives opponents something to be outraged about instead of responding to what people are actually discussing. But this is not a time when a lot of people running for office follow political rules. Marianne Williamson, the spiritual teacher and bestselling author running for the Democratic presidential nomination, invoked the Holocaust when talking about Trump’s promised immigration action at n event in New Hampsire Tuesday, and did it more strongly when asked about it afterwards. “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m a Jew,” Williamson told a small crowd on the campus of Southern New Hampshire University. “And we are raised to say ‘never again.’ It’s happening again.” The crowd applauded.  “There are some people who would say to me, ‘now Ms. Williamson, I think this Jewish analogy, you’ve really gone too far there. This is not the same situation at all,’” she went on, doing an impression of a tut-tutting critic. “But ladies and gentlemen some of those people will be deported to places so dangerous that it actually is no different.”  In an interview after the rally, Williamson added some nuance, but mostly doubled down.  “[Trump is] announcing it, he’s celebrating it like it’s something to be proud of,” she said of Trump’s tweet. “I don’t know about you, but I have visited the Anne Frank House. I’ve been to those places where people hid Jews in the basement. When I think of the fear that some people are going through right now after the president made that announcement, you know, where are they going to go?”  “‘Never again’ is never supposed to mean ‘never again to us.’ It’s supposed to mean ‘never again, period,’” Williamson continued. “Some people would say ‘well, Marianne, that’s a false analogy because yes there might be mass arrests, yes there might be mass deportations, but they’re not being sent to the gas chambers.’ Yes, that is true. However, when we really allow ourselves to consider where they are going, to some of them they will be returned to almost certain violence and deep injustice.” WATCH: Donate to a presidential campaign, get harassed Cover: Democratic presidential candidate and self-help author Marianne Williamson speaks at the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Dinner on June 9, 2019 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

832,832,07-04-17 13:30,2017,4,7,Constance Grady,"What Joan Didion’s new book, South and West, explains about her sensibility","The standard critique of Joan Didion — insofar as there is a standard critique of the legend, one of America’s greatest prose stylists and a pioneer of new journalism, she of the inscrutable cigarette-dangling photograph — is that she is a cold and self-centered writer. That her exquisitely polished and balanced sentences concern only herself, and never her ostensible subjects. Didion, says Barbara Grizzuti Harrison in her famous 1980 takedown, reports almost exclusively on “Didion’s sensibility,” noting that in the author’s essays, said sensibility “assumes more importance than, say, the existence of the electric chair.” For Harrison, this aesthetic focus seems vaguely immoral. She argues that Didion is always writing about her own taste, which is the taste of an educated upper-class West Coast white woman: minimalist, but expensively so. When she writes about the working classes or the nouveau riche, it is almost always with a faint sense of distaste for their poor taste, and rarely with an eye toward the systemic inequalities that separates her world from theirs. In the parlance of 2017, Harrison thinks Didion needs to check her privilege. As I read Didion’s new/old book — South and West: From a Notebook, which is a newly released reproduction of Didion’s notes for two unfinished essays, one from 1970 and the other from 1976 — Harrison’s critique kept popping into my mind. Didion’s notes are overwhelmingly focused on her own aesthetic sensibility, just as Harrison charged, but they are not amoral. It’s just that Didion’s morality is aesthetic. South and West is split into two sections. “Notes on the South” sees Didion traveling through the Gulf South states in order, she writes, to understand California and America more clearly. It’s an amorphous idea, one that Didion never seems to have articulated to her satisfaction, and the notes mostly consist of quick, impressionistic sketches of each state and long transcriptions of her conversations there. “California Notes,” much slighter, is a series of notes Didion took in preparation for covering the Patty Hearst trial. “I thought the trial had some meaning for me,” Didion writes, “because I was from California. This didn’t turn out to be true.” Her observations are all about California and how class functions there, specifically the upper-upper classes, to which both Didion and Hearst belong. They are, in other words, notes about Didion trying to understand herself and her home and her class by placing them all in opposition to something other: the South, which is antithetical to her aesthetically and culturally, and Patty Hearst, whom Didion seems to think of as the epitome of her own personal type of Californian wealth, and who was so rapidly undone after her kidnapping. “I am trying to place myself in history,” Didion writes in “California Notes,” continuing: “In the South they are convinced that they have bloodied their place with history. In the West we do not believe that anything we do can bloody the land, or change it, or touch it.” Didion’s notes repeatedly circle this idea: She sees the South as a place enamored of the past, as opposed to California’s obsession with the future, and intuits that the South and its nostalgia are the key to America’s future, not California’s utopian visions. Much has been made of her prescience in this regard, and how this line of thought anticipated the culture split of the 2016 presidential election, but for Didion, what seems to be most unsettling about the South and its rising influence is that it upsets her sense of aesthetics. She’s trying to make her aesthetic unease the basis for her argument that the South is troubling, and perhaps the reason the essay remains unfinished is that she wasn’t quite able to make that rhetorical leap. Didion seems troubled by the idea that the ground feels more unstable in the South; that it is wet and porous, without any solid boundaries; that it is simultaneously fecund and rotting. “The wilderness is sensed as very near,” she writes, “not the redemptive wilderness of the western imagination but something rank and old and malevolent, the idea of wilderness not as an escape from civilization and its discontents but as a mortal threat to a community precarious and colonial in its deepest aspect.” She quotes, with a faint sense of menace, the famous naturalist John James Audubon on “the dangerous nature of the ground, its oozing, spongy, and miry disposition.” For Didion, the very land of the South is in opposition to her crisply defined Californian aesthetic. Didion is writing about her own sensibility — as Harrison argued she always does — but she is not doing so apolitically or amorally. South and West reminds me of Elif Batuman’s new novel, The Idiot, in which the narrator is charged with seeing the world through strictly aesthetic terms, an idea the character finds hard to grasp: It had never occurred to me to think of aesthetics and ethics as opposites. I thought ethics were aesthetic. “Ethics” meant the golden rule, which was basically an aesthetic rule. That’s why it was called “golden,” like the golden ratio. “Isn’t that why you don’t cheat or steal — because it’s ugly?” I said. Like the narrator of The Idiot, Didion’s morality and her politics are both aesthetic. She finds the South both beautiful and aesthetically threatening, and that aesthetic menace becomes an ontological menace through a process she cannot quite render into a coherent argument. She thinks the California class system is not quite in good taste and hence might be immoral, but she cannot translate her aesthetic outrage into moral outrage. Perhaps the most telling passage in South and West comes as Didion is traveling from New Orleans to Mississippi, when she buys a beach towel printed with the Confederate flag. “It is ragged and gray now,” she writes, “and sits in my linen closet in California amid thick and delicately colored Fieldcrest beach towels, and my child prefers it to the good ones.” For Didion, the Confederate flag–printed towel is offensive in primarily aesthetic and classed terms: It is cheap and of poor quality, and its colors faded quickly; it is a lower-class and ugly object that doesn’t integrate well with Didion’s carefully selected, high-quality, expensive towels. In South and West, the aesthetic underpinnings of Didion’s intellectual ideology all become clear: When Didion wants to disavow something, she does not make a moral argument. She argues that it is ugly. Conversely, when something pleases her, she argues that it is beautiful. South and West is an unfinished book, but it’s worth reading as a peek under the hood at Didion’s extraordinarily lucid arguments: It shows you the beginnings of her thought process, as she’s just beginning to translate aesthetic judgment into rhetorical logic. If you like Didion, you can glory in the beauty of her sentence fragments and analyze the beginnings of her process; if you don’t like her, you can feel vindicated in knowing that her reporting notes really are quite self-centered. South and West does not succeed in creating a coherent argument about America or California or the South, but for insight into Didion herself, it’s invaluable.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/7/15161314/joan-didions-south-west-review,,Vox
833,833,18-03-19 00:00,2019,3,18,Kenneth Li,Warner Bros CEO Kevin Tsujihara resigns as AT&T probes 'mistakes',"(Reuters) - Kevin Tsujihara has resigned as the head of Warner Bros as one of Hollywood’s most powerful studios investigates a report that he improperly helped an actress obtain roles at the studio.  He is the latest in a line of executives to lose their jobs in the media business following accusations of improper conduct or sexual harassment.   “It is in the best interest of WarnerMedia, Warner Bros, our employees and our partners for Kevin to step down as Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros,” WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey said in a statement on Monday.   Tsujihara’s departure from the AT&T Inc-owned studio follows a March 6 article in the Hollywood Reporter that said an actress had sought his help in landing roles after they had sex.    The report included text messages between Tsujihara and the actress that appeared to reveal they had sex. Tsujihara has not directly addressed his relationship with the actress, whether they had sex, nor his involvement in helping her career.   “Kevin acknowledges that his mistakes are inconsistent with the company’s leadership expectations and could impact the company’s ability to execute going forward,” Stankey said in his statement.   Stankey did not specify what mistakes Tsujihara made. Only two days before the Hollywood Reporter published its story, Tsujihara was given an expanded, more powerful role as part of a restructuring of AT&T’s WarnerMedia.   “It has become clear that my continued leadership could be a distraction and an obstacle to the company’s continued success,” Tsujihara said in an email to employees on Monday, which was seen by Reuters. “The hard work of everyone within our organization is truly admirable, and I won’t let media attention on my past detract from all the great work the team is doing.”      Tsujihara did not address why he was leaving in the email. Earlier this month, following the Hollywood Reporter story, Tsujihara’s attorney said the executive did not have a direct role in the hiring of the actress in any movie.  AT&T is continuing to work with an outside law firm to complete its investigation into the matter, Stankey said.   That would be the third investigation, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters, and was sparked by the Hollywood Reporter article, which included text messages between the executive, the actress and two business partners.  Tsujihara was cleared in two previous internal investigations related to the matter since late 2017, the sources said. The first, conducted by Time Warner, was initiated at Tsujihara’s request, the sources said, and the second was conducted by AT&T.  AT&T shares rose 0.4 percent and closed at $30.80.

835,835,13-06-17 00:00,2017,6,13,John Goodrich,Figures Formed from the Primal Energies of Paint,"Janice Nowinski’s paintings, currently on view at John Davis Gallery in Hudson, possess a kind of brute grace. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads HUDSON, NY — Beneath their crude surfaces, Janice Nowinski’s paintings harbor a wealth of expression In her third show at John Davis Gallery, Nowinski continues to combine a distinctly “low,” unpolished approach with high ambitions for painting. The artist’s fairly conventional motifs — figures posed in landscapes and interiors — conceal a sophisticated orchestration of line and color. Despite her inelegant attack, with its coarse brushwork, abbreviated forms, and predilection for darkish, grayed green-blues, the paintings possess a kind of brute grace. In the strongest of them, the effect is truly striking: a straitened virtuosity that could arise only from a keen sensibility, a blunt honesty, and an impatience with the superficial. The rough cement walls of John Davis’s carriage house gallery provide an apt backdrop for Nowinski’s 18 paintings. Together, these small pieces suggest, with refreshing directness, the routine behind an artist’s calling. Nude models pose in interior scenes, while clothed figures stand casually in landscapes or gather sociably at a table. Poses seemingly inspired by Courbet and Watteau, as well as a study after a Masolino baptism, suggest an artist restocking her stores of inspiration. Connecting the paintings is a subtle — delicate, even — sense of color and its power to locate forms in light. When a figure stands in the midst of a landscape, or extends a limb through space, the gesture convinces, weighted by the shifting energies of colors. For instance, “Reclining Nude” (2017) recounts, with luscious felicity, each event of a figure lengthening just below the onlooker’s point of view. The muted gray-brown of a lower leg turns abruptly into the brilliant beige-pink of an illuminated thigh. The slightly subdued glow of belly leads to the dimmer pinkish-brown of an arm — equally absorptive and reflective of light — that cradles the darkest note of all, the shadowed orb of the head. The facial features are little more than scribbles and the hand a crude mitt, but the figure unfolds across the small canvas with the gravity of mountains under a low sun. Alongside “Reclining Nude” hangs “Figure Revealed” (2016), capturing a very different but no less intricate scenario of light. Here, a seated model’s head and arms occupy a zone of luminous shadow between a lifted piece of fabric — radiantly lit — and legs in deep shade below. The tangibly descending light animates each element, turning the dots of the model’s eyes into a human presence peering at us from the depths. Other notable paintings include the image of a head framed by a pillow, its weight and volume captured in broad gestures of color, and a landscape titled “Opening a Bottle” (2016), in which the dramatically contrasting horizontals of a deep space silhouette a lone, shadowy figure. Not every painting is quite as vivid, but every work in the installation reveals a determination to forge a semblance out of primal energies of paint. By the standards of a traditional academy, with its prioritizing of taste and finish, such works might seem naively inarticulate. But they are eloquent, often complexly so, as expressions of form and color — arguably, painting’s most unique claim to shaping the real.

836,836,23-03-18 23:17,2018,3,23,Eric Johnson,Facebook and Cambridge Analytica: What just happened?,"Public trust in Facebook has taken several beatings in the past 18 months, and the social networking giant was done no favors by the recent revelation that a political data firm called Cambridge Analytica had smuggled millions of users’ data out of the site, exploiting a loophole in Facebook’s platform. On the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask, Recode’s Kurt Wagner explained how that happened and what might happen next, along with The Verge’s Lauren Goode and Recode’s Kara Swisher. The podcast was recorded on Wednesday night, very shortly after Wagner and Swisher finished interviewing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, “A lot of people do know what Facebook does with your data,” Wagner said. “What caught people off guard here is that, one, some 50 million users found their data in the hands of someone that they did not give permission to have it. Two, we find out that Facebook knew about this three years ago and never said anything publicly. I think there’s this betrayal of trust right now.” Part of the problem is that, back in the days when Facebook was a scrappy startup fighting its way to the top, privacy was not a moneymaker — but plugging users’ data into a plethora of outsiders’ apps was. That’s also why, Wagner explained, it’s wrong to call the Cambridge Analytica affair a “breach,” because at no point was the data obtained through hacking or other illegal tactics. “When you’re a venture-backed business that’s trying to rapidly scale and add as many new users as possible, if you’re the profile — if I’m downloading 10 new apps a month and I’m using my Facebook identity to log into all 10 of those — I’m probably not leaving Facebook,” he said. “There’s a huge value to them in doing that.” You can listen to the new podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts. On the new podcast, Swisher and Wagner noted that they were both pleased by Zuckerberg’s willingness to answer all the questions they asked directly — you can read the full transcript of their interview here. But one of the lingering questions was, why did it take so long for Zuckerberg to surface at all? Wagner said it may tie back to the CEO’s widely publicized claim, after the 2016 election, that it was “crazy” that “fake news” on Facebook might have influenced the outcome. “Do you know how many times people pointed to that interview and said, ‘Hey, remember that time Mark Zuckerberg said it was crazy and now look?’” Wagner said. “He looked super naive. In this scenario, I think they remembered that interview and said, ‘Before we get all the facts, the last thing we want is to put Mark out there in front of the press to say something that we’re going to backtrack later on.’ That is my hunch.” Swisher took issue with Zuckerberg’s reluctance to be the arbiter of content on the platform — that’s a requirement of the job, she said. “They have to take responsibility. That’s what adults do. This is their company, they’ve made billions of dollars off of it, they decimated industries — they really control the online advertising market,” Swisher said. “They need to be responsible and make choices.” “Making choices means you piss people off, making choices means you have to give up some things,” she added. “They can’t have everything. They can’t have the world’s biggest platform and not be responsible for it. If they don’t want to do it, then get out of the way.” Have questions about Facebook, Cambridge Analytica or anything else that you want us to address in a future episode?

837,837,28-12-17 00:00,2017,12,28,Hyonhee Shin,South Korea 'humbly accepts' there is no proof border park cash funded North's weapons,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it “humbly accepts” there is no evidence North Korea diverted wages paid to its workers by South Korean firms in a now-closed border industrial park to bankroll its weapons programs as the previous government asserted.  The South’s unification ministry was responding to the findings of a panel which contradicted claims of money being transferred by North Korea as it pursues its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions.  It said would take follow-up steps to boost transparency and public trust in its policy towards the North.  South Korea said last year that most of the cash that flowed into the jointly run Kaesong complex was being diverted. It made the claim when it pulled out of the joint venture in response to the North’s launch of a long-range missile.  In July, two months after liberal President Moon Jae-in was elected, a South Korean government official said there was no hard evidence to back up the assertion.  The decision to suspend the Kaesong project was “unilaterally and verbally” made by Moon’s predecessor, ousted president Park Geun-hye, a day after the missile test and without any formal discussions within the administration, the panel, appointed by the unification ministry, said.   “The presidential office inserted the wage-diversion argument as major grounds, yet without concrete information, sufficient evidence and consultations with related agencies, mainly citing defector testimonies that lack objectivity and credibility,” Kim Jong-soo, a priest who heads the panel, told a news conference.   “This impairs the decision’s legitimacy and could constrain our ground over a future restart of the complex, while hampering the companies’ rights to protect their assets due to the hasty pullout process.”  About 120 South Korean companies paid about double the $70 a month minimum wage in North Korea for each of the 55,000 workers hired in Kaesong.  The project resulted from the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000, when leaders of the two Koreas vowed reconciliation and cooperation. It was the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement amid frosty cross-border ties.  Moon has pledged to reopen the industrial park if there is progress on the North’s denuclearization, but political tensions and the North’s aloofness have tied the president’s hands.       Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States.  A group of South Korean businessmen who own factories in Kaesong demanded a formal apology.  The companies together suffered losses of 250 billion won ($200 million) due to the closure, aside from equipment and raw materials left behind, the group said in February.   “Now that the wage-diversion claim has proved groundless, the government must apologize for abusing state power to suspend the complex and make utmost efforts to reopen it,” the group said in a statement after the conference.  North Korea’s state-run web sites said in October the country had restarted some operations in Kaesong on its own, saying it was “nobody’s business what we do in an industrial complex where our nation’s sovereignty is exercised”.

838,838,10-07-17 13:50,2017,7,10,Alex Abad-Santos,Spider-Man: Homecoming had a huge opening weekend at the box office,"Spider-Man has found his home sweet home. Spider-Man: Homecoming opened with an estimated $117 million at the domestic box office this weekend. It’s a confidence boost for a film studio that has struggled to achieve success in bringing the legendary Marvel character to the big screen. After Sony’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man films fizzled out, ending with 2007’s Spider-Man 3, the studio wasted little time in rebooting them. The Amazing Spider-Man, starring Andrew Garfield, launched in 2012; it opened to $62 million domestically, going on to gross $262 domestically and nearly $758 million worldwide. Its sequel, 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2, opened to $91.6 million domestically, going on to gross $202.8 million domestically and nearly $709 million worldwide. But even though The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had a bigger opening weekend than its predecessor, Sony considered the film a disappointment because of its lower worldwide total. Sequels are generally expected to make more money than the original. That disappointment not only caused Sony to cancel its plans for an Amazing Spider-Man 3, but to seek out a new actor to play the web-slinger. The studio also struck a landmark deal with Marvel Studios that would allow Spider-Man to appear in a Marvel film, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. Spider-Man: Homecoming — a co-production between Sony and Marvel, starring Tom Holland as Spidey — is the result. And Homecoming’s $117 million opening weekend seems to indicate that partnering with Marvel and casting Holland were both excellent decisions on Sony’s part, decisions that might finally get Spider-Man’s cinematic legacy back on track.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/10/15944066/spider-man-homecoming-box-office-opening-weekend-117-million,,Vox
839,839,01-11-16 15:00,2016,11,1,Sam Ellis,"How Donald Trump thinks about foreign policy, explained in 7 minutes","Donald Trump’s coziness with Vladimir Putin, casual talk of taking Iraq’s oil and abandoning NATO, and muddled messaging on whether he'd deploy American troops to battle ISIS makes it easy to assume that the GOP nominee's foreign policy is a jumbled mishmash of ideas lacking any coherent philosophy. That couldn't be more wrong. In fact, a close look at Trump’s public comments leads to a very different conclusion: Trump has a distinct worldview that knits together many of his specific proposals. We can sum it up in a word: transactional. To the mogul, all of foreign policy is motivated by assessments of what's better, financially, for the US. Washington should have few if any fixed alliances, allegiances, or even adversaries. Instead, Trump believes that everything comes down to the art of the transaction, with countries that spend their money the way he wants them to getting more than countries that don't. That sound appealing on the surface; what American wouldn't want to believe that his or her government is doing all it can to benefit them in a material way while leaving other nations to defend themselves rather than relying on the US. That's particularly true given that the risks of bad foreign policy choices (the costly and seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for instance) are easier to spot than the gains (stability on the Korean Peninsula, for instance). The problem is that foreign policy can't be reduced to a question of dollars and cents, and attempts to do so — even in the form of Trump's bombastic campaign rhetoric — can do lasting damage. Telling Moscow that the US would only defend NATO allies from a Russian invasion if the countries had spent more on their militaries risks pushing away Eastern European allies while emboldening Vladimir Putin. Openly talking of taking Iraq’s oil complicates Washington's relationship with Baghdad and feeds into widespread conspiracy theories in the Arab world about why the US continues to intervene in the Middle East. And casually telling Japan and South Korea that they should develop their own nuclear weapons could trigger a dangerous new arms race in one of the world's most tumultuous regions. With polls tightening in the waning days of the election, it’s more important than ever to take Trump seriously and examine his actual ideas in details. In this video, we try to do exactly that.",https://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/1/13481594/donald-trump-explained-foreign-policy,,Vox
840,840,05-04-19 19:40,2019,4,5,Aaron Rupar,Trump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one day,"President Donald Trump made two remarkably authoritarian comments on Friday, first urging Congress to “get rid of judges” — specifically, immigration judges — and later demeaning the entire media as the “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” But in a sign of how normalized the behavior of this president has become, neither remark amounted to much more than a blip on the news radar. Trump made his comment about immigration judges during a question-and-answer session with reporters before departing the White House for a photo opportunity along the southern border in California. “Congress has to act,” Trump said. “They have to get rid of catch and release, chain migration, visa lottery, they have to get rid of the whole asylum system because it doesn’t work, and frankly, we should get rid of judges. You can’t have a court case every time somebody steps foot on our ground.” Trump calls on Congress to ""get rid of the whole asylum system"" because ""it doesn't work.""""Frankly, we should get rid of judges,"" he adds. pic.twitter.com/5s8kI9mbHR Trump’s comments marked the second time this week he has urged Congress “to get rid of judges” — a proposal that, thankfully, for those of us who value checks and balances, has little chance of gaining traction now that Democrats control the House. The president, however, is not even trying to hide the fact he’d like to have the power to summarily deport migrants and asylum seekers, and has already demonstrated a willingness to try and seize emergency powers toward that end. Later, while Air Force One was on its way to California, Trump posted a tweet in which he characterized the entire “press” as “truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can’t stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Trump’s tweet represented an escalation of his anti-press rhetoric. In the past, Trump had been careful to qualify his “enemy of the people” attacks as applying to “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA,” the “Fake News,” or only pertaining to “much of the Media.” White House officials cited Trump’s hedging in his defense. After a Trump fan sent package bombs to a number of prominent Trump critics in the media and politics last fall, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trump’s “enemy of the people” tweets by saying, “the president’s not referencing all media. He’s talking about the growing amount of fake news in the country. The president’s calling that out.” But last month, Trump went a step further and called “The Mainstream Media” “the Enemy of the People.” Now, he’s using that attack against the entire press. The president says a lot of ugly stuff, and much of it can safely be tuned out. Still, Trump’s comments on Friday highlight how unprecedented the current state of affairs is for our country. The president aspires to being an authoritarian ruler and isn’t really trying to hide it. Regardless of whether you take Trump’s comments literally or merely seriously, they are disturbing. Judges are a vital part of the rule of law, and the free press is important in any democracy. Those values were mostly taken for granted in this country, but should not be any longer.

841,841,18-09-16 19:00,2016,9,18,Becky Ferreira,Hubble Captures the Best View of a Disintegrating Comet Yet,"We tend to think of the Sun as the essential life-giver, what with all of its contributions to fostering ecosystems on Earth. But our star can also be a stone cold comet killer, as demonstrated by new imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope showing Comet 332P/Ikeya-Murakami being brutally flayed and broken apart by solar radiation. These images were snapped over the course of three days beginning on January 26, 2016, when the 1,600-foot-long comet was 150 million miles from Sun, around the same distance as the orbit of Mars.  The comet itself is the brightest object, on the left, while the sparkly points moving towards the right of the frame are chunks of debris that were blasted away from the main body after a 2015 outburst. This trail of icy detritus stretches for 3,000 miles behind the comet. All of the objects pictured brighten whenever their iciest, most reflective patches are angled toward the Sun.  According to new research about the observations published on Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the images offer the most comprehensive view of comet disintegration ever recorded. ""We know that comets sometimes disintegrate, but we don't know much about why or how they come apart,"" said lead author David Jewitt, an astronomer based at UCLA, in a statement.  ""The trouble is that it happens quickly and without warning, and so we don't have much chance to get useful data,"" he continued. ""With Hubble's fantastic resolution, not only do we see really tiny, faint bits of the comet, but we can watch them change from day to day. And that has allowed us to make the best measurements ever obtained on such an object."" At 4.5 billion years old, Comet 332P/Ikeya-Murakami is nearly as ancient as the solar system itself. For most of its lifespan, it was happy to soar around with its comet buddies in the frozen Kuiper Belt surrounding the solar system. But then, one day, it had a run-in with Neptune that gravitationally slingshotted it into the realm of the planets, and toward the unforgiving heat of the Sun. It was in this altered trajectory that the comet was first discovered, in 2010. NASA footage of Comet 332P/Ikeya-Murakami after it was discovered in 2010. As exposure to the Sun's intense rays warms the comet, powerful jets blast large building-sized pieces off its body. These explosive outbursts act like ""rocket engines,"" according to NASA, accelerating the spin of the comet to dizzying rotation speeds. An observer on the surface of Comet 332P/Ikeya-Murakami would see the Sun rise and set within an hour. Talk about a recipe for a puke-a-thon.  At this rate, the comet probably only has 150 years left to live. Of course, that still means it will probably outlive you or I. But considering that the object has been knocking around since before the birth of life on Earth, ""it's the blink of an eye, astronomically speaking,"" according to Jewitt.  ""In Comet 332P we may be seeing a comet fragmenting itself into oblivion,"" he added. ""The trip to the inner solar system has doomed it.""",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/53dkxq/hubble-captures-the-best-view-of-a-disintegrating-comet-yet,Tech by VICE,Vice
842,842,20-08-18 00:00,2018,8,20,Anshuman Daga,Exclusive: U.S. energy group Hess Corp's SE Asia assets attract bid interest - sources,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets of U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp (HES.N), estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion, have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand’s PTTEP PCL (PTTEP.BK) and Austrian energy group OMV AG (OMVV.VI), people familiar with the matter said.  Hess, which has a collection of gas fields in North Malay Basin in offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) with 50 percent equal partner Petronas, has not yet decided whether to sell the assets, according to financial and industry sources.   Their estimated market value would be about $4 billion to $5 billion, the sources said. They declined to be identified because the takeover interest had not previously been made public.  The interest in Hess’ assets, among the few long-term and sizeable projects in the region, comes as cashed-up firms such as PTTEP are buying overseas assets, while the likes of OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company have been scouring for acquisitions in Asia..  Hess, which hasn’t reported a profit since 2014, has been under pressure from investors to make money. It posted a smaller-than-expected loss in April-June, but many of its peers have turned profitable after the oil price crash two years ago, fuelling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit.  The firm is developing large offshore oil projects in South America and U.S. shale oil. In 2014, it sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for $1 billion and also sold its Indonesian assets.  “We don’t comment on rumours but we continue to believe that our Malaysia assets are an important part of our portfolio and our value creation strategy,” Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker said in a statement.  “JDA and North Malay Basin are significant long-term, low-cost cash generators, producing stable production and free cash flows, which provide funding for our compelling, long-term opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken (in the United States).”  “A number of parties have looked (at the Hess assets) and have teams working on this,” said one financial source. “Increasing numbers of companies believe a sale is probable,” said the person, adding that Hess’ project would also appeal to private-equity backed players and mid-sized energy firms.  He said PTTEP was working with a financial advisor for its interest in the assets.  Another source said some parties had done preliminary work on the assets and were waiting to see if Hess would start a sale process.  OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company declined to comment.  This month, OMV won regulatory approval to buy Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) upstream assets in New Zealand for $578 million. OMV said in March that the acquisition was a key step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with its new strategy.  Petronas declined comment while PTTEP said it was focused on expanding in Southeast Asia.  “PTTEP is interested in M&A deals with particular focus on assets located in PTTEP’s region of experience such as South East Asia, which is PTTEP’s areas of expertise and the operating risk is moderately low,” the Thai company told Reuters, declining to comment specifically on Hess assets.  The industry’s prospects have brightened as oil LCOc1 and natural gas LNG-AS prices have more than doubled since early 2016, with demand for oil in Asia - the world’s biggest consumer - also growing strongly even as production is falling faster than anywhere else.  Hess’ nine gas fields in the North Malay Basin have an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 20 million barrels of condensate. Production started in July 2017.  The company has a 50 percent working interest in the Southeast Asian blocks with Petronas Carigali, a fully-owned subsidiary of Petronas.  Hess signed a production-sharing contract with Petronas in 2012 and has a contract with the oil major till 2029.  “Hess is pursuing divestments globally, high grading its portfolio centered around its Guyana and U.S. Bakken (shale) interests,” said Saul Kavonic, director of Asia/Pacific markets and head of energy research in Australia at Credit Suisse.

Following is an outline of the resources and assets the world’s biggest entertainment company, with a current market value of about $166 billion, will hold if the deal is completed.  - Under the deal, Disney is acquiring Fox’s FX and National Geographic cable channels, its movie studio, India’s main network Star and a stake in European pay-TV provider Sky Plc SKYB.L.    - Taken together, Fox and Disney generated a total of $16.3 billion in advertising revenue in the 2017 financial year.   - The two companies’ studio businesses generated $16.6 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2017.  - Disney’s ESPN sports channels have about 88 million U.S. subscribers and 146 million internationally.   - Data from film industry website Box Office Mojo gives Fox and Disney together about 30 percent of an estimated $10 billion in box office taken by U.S. cinemas so far this year, which would make the combined company the single largest player, ahead of Time Warner Inc’s TWX.N Warner Bros with 20 percent.  - British bank Barclays said Hulu, Sky, and India’s Tata Sky together give Disney 46 million streaming or cable subscriptions in the United States, Western Europe and India, compared to Netflix’s global figure of 109 million customers.   - Barclays analysts also calculated that the combined movie and TV libraries of Fox Studio and Disney’s Buena Vista studios, which includes Pixar Animations and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, has more titles than Netflix.  - Disney plans to pull its first-run movies from Netflix starting in 2019. If it did the same with Fox programming, Netflix would lose “The Simpsons,” the “Star Wars” franchise and all Marvel superhero films.   - The deal would give Disney access to franchises and characters including “X-Men,” “Wolverine,” “Deadpool” and “Fantastic Four” and reunite them with the rest of the Marvel comic universe under one roof.  - Disney’s library of kids’ content dwarfs Netflix’s, with over 700 titles compared to around 400, according to Barclays.   - Disney will be able to distribute its programming on Star India, operator of 69 channels in eight languages in the world’s fastest-growing subscription TV market, as well as Star’s popular Hotstar streaming service.

Below are some of the factors that could decide who prevails:  Venezuela has a long history of military rebellions and coups, notably the 1958 overthrow of dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, and the failed attempt by Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, to take office by force in a 1992 army coup. After being elected to office, Chavez himself survived a putsch a decade later.  Now Guaido is seeking a widespread army uprising against Maduro, who has overseen a 50 percent collapse in the economy and shortages of food and medicine that have led more than 3 million Venezuelans to leave the country since he took office in 2013.   Although the young opposition leader was accompanied at a rally in Caracas on Tuesday by several dozen armed troops, it did not immediately appear that he had won much support from the country’s 200,000-strong armed forces, and 25 of the soldiers with him later sought refuge in the Brazilian embassy.  Since declaring himself interim president in January, Guaido has repeatedly made overtures to the military, offering an amnesty from prosecutions if they join him, with only marginal success.   Several hundred soldiers have defected and left the country for Brazil or Colombia in recent weeks but not in numbers high enough to threaten Maduro’s grip.   One risk is that a military split leads to prolonged violence among different armed factions.  Maduro’s offer of negotiations with Guaido, moderated by the Vatican, Mexico or Uruguay, has been rejected by the opposition, which says previous rounds of talks allowed the government to stall for time without making any real concessions.   While some 50 nations, including the United States, have declared support for Guaido, Maduro still has powerful backers, notably Russia and China. Others allies include Cuba, Iran and Turkey.   U.S. national security advisor John Bolton has called on Russia to drop its support for Maduro, which includes military advisers. While some believe Moscow could negotiate an exit and safe passage out of Venezuela for the president, there are few signs Putin is willing to give up on the government that gives him most geo-political clout in the Americas.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN on Tuesday that Maduro was prepared to leave Venezuela on Tuesday morning but reversed his plan after Russia said he should stay.  Bolton said on Tuesday the opposition had won commitments from leading members of Maduro’s administration that the president had to go, but there was no public sign of high-level splits within the government that could lead to a transition.  U.S.-BACKED MILITARY OPS  Erik Prince - the founder of private security firm Blackwater and a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump - has been pushing a plan to deploy a private army to help topple Maduro, sources told Reuters.  Prince’s pitch will only add to speculation that the United States, while unlikely to invade Venezuela to bring down Maduro, might resort to irregular military action, such as the kind of intelligence service-backed covert operations used by Washington a number of times in 20th-century Latin America.   A person familiar with the Trump administration’s thinking said the White House would not support such a plan.  Although some former Venezuelan security officials opposed to Maduro are now based in Colombia and have claimed involvement in a drone attack on the president last year, there is little evidence that such operations are being prepared at the moment.

849,849,25-06-19 00:00,2019,6,25,John Miller,Fund supermarket Allfunds bulks up with Credit Suisse deal,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Spain’s Allfunds Group is buying Credit Suisse’s business-to-business investment fund platform InvestLab for an undisclosed sum as the investment services industry consolidates to reap the benefits of scale.   Credit Suisse will take a stake of up to 18% in the combined business, the two companies said on Tuesday. It will also receive an undisclosed cash payment.   The Swiss bank said the transaction would result in a 0.5% increase in return on tangible equity (RoTE) this year, which Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said suggested the sale price “had to be relatively high”.   Even so, the analysts said the deal to combine what essentially are digital fund supermarkets would have little impact on the operating business at Credit Suisse.  “This transaction is really a sideshow” for Credit Suisse, Zuercher Kantonalbank’s Javier Lodeiro said, adding the gross margin for the combined Allfunds-Investlab business from assets under custody was probably “extremely thin”.  Allfunds calls itself the world’s largest institutional fund distribution network and said the combination with Credit Suisse InvestLab would offer 78,000 investment products to financial institutions across more than 45 countries, with assets under management topping 500 billion euros ($570 billion).  Credit Suisse is exiting control amid consolidation in a technology-driven business area where scale has grown more important, creating opportunities for Allfunds to bulk up.  Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and private equity investor Hellman & Friedman bought Allfunds in 2017 from Intesa Sanpaolo Group, Santander Group, General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus.    “Going forward, Credit Suisse will utilize the combined business platform to distribute mutual funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds),” the Swiss bank said in a statement.  InvestLab has about two dozen employees, who will retain their jobs with the transaction, a spokesman said.   “The combination will allow Allfunds to accelerate and expand its investment into the development of new services and solutions to the benefit of the funds eco-system, comprising of asset managers, fund distributors and other intermediaries,” Allfunds said.   “With this arrangement, Allfunds continues its global expansion into new territories while consolidating business ambitions in Asia and Central Europe,” Allfunds added, saying Switzerland would become a key business hub following the deal, which is due to close in early 2020.   InvestLab offers distributors access to over 46,000 products from more than 170 providers worldwide, with assets under management topping 140 billion Swiss francs ($144 billion).

850,850,15-02-19 21:49,2019,2,15,Harry Cheadle,Trump's Phony Emergency Pushed America a Little Closer Toward a Real Crisis,"Or maybe right-wingers are leery of Trump going down this path because it's clear where it leads. If the situation on the border is a ""crisis"" at a time when unauthorized crossings are relatively low, literally anything can be a crisis. And the politics of constant crisis will mean even more gamesmanship, more partisan aggression, more rule-bending and norm-breaking, and—in a worst-case scenario—fewer guardrails on the country sliding into actual authoritarianism.  Trump's declaration sparked an uproar from the intellectual branch of the conservative movement, which—at least since the George W. Bush era—has often despaired at the expansion of presidential power. Several writers fretted that Democrats will quickly use this emerging precedent to aggressively pursue their own priorities once they retake the White House. Noah Rothman called it the ""crossing of the Rubicon,"" while Jonah Goldberg predicted it would be a ""long-term gift to progressives."" Both noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already mused about declaring a state of emergency over gun violence. The darkest right-wing fantasy probably involves something like President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declaring unilaterally in 2030 that airplanes are now banned as part of the Green New Deal Five-Year Plan. But concern over executive branch overreach seems largely confined to the pundit class. In practice, presidents of both parties, including Barack Obama and Bush, have expanded the powers of the office whenever they could, and Congress has largely let that happen as its own power eroded. Trump's declaration of emergency isn't a break from tradition but the continuation of a long, downward slide into who knows what.  There's always the risk of sounding hyperbolic when talking about that slide. Trump's state of emergency will face a legal challenge, and even if he triumphs there, it doesn't create an easy path for Comrade Ocasio-Cortez to snap her fingers Thanos-like and usher in a new socialist age. The $8 billion Trump is looking to divert from other sources toward a wall is peanuts compared to the $32 trillion Bernie Sanders's Medicare for all proposal might cost over a decade, or the even heftier price tag some have put on the Green New Deal The problem isn't the nuts and bolts of the declaration, but the rationale behind it. Trump's entire presidential campaign, from the primaries to his eventual razor-thin win, was aflame with apocalyptic rhetoric and drastic, often patently unconstitutional proposals. He called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, gleefully embraced calls to jail his opponent, and praised torture. He hasn't acted on all those impulses (though his ""travel ban"" clearly grew out of his Islamophobic rhetoric), but he remains fond of extremism in defense of just about anything—on Friday, during his announcement of the state of emergency, he went into a tangent praising China using the death penalty for drug dealers. Those statements are shocking because normal politicians aren't so crude, but in truth Republicans have for decades been campaigning and governing—and sometimes shutting down the government—as if the end of the world were just around the corner. Trump's declaration of emergency is a natural outgrowth of the philosophy that every lever of power can be used with no limit and that the ends always justify the means—even when the end is a hideous monument to racism. The GOP has treated politics as an emergency for decades, and in an emergency, glass gets broken, rules are ignored, any evil can be excused as necessary. Conservative Republicans spent the Obama years derailing compromises on immigration, attempting to block the Affordable Care Act rather than working in good faith with Democrats, and doing whatever they could to obstruct the president's agenda, up to and including denying him a Supreme Court appointment. After Trump's election, they refused to include Democrats in conversations around repealing the ACA and rushed through an error-ridden tax cut bill. Meanwhile, Republicans have benefitted from gerrymandering, struck down key portions of the Voting Rights Act, and moved to consolidate their power in states like North Carolina in extremely aggressive, sometimes legally dubious, ways. This encourages a counter-reaction from Democrats. If Trump's priorities are emergencies, his opposition has to use similar language or risk looking complacent, disinterested, or just bland. He's created a space where the Democratic base is talking about packing the Supreme Court, adding new states to elect Democratic senators, and abolishing the filibuster rules that make it impossible to pass laws without 60 seats in the Senate. If Democrats retake power in 2020, what arguments will their leadership have not to consider those moves, especially with climate change posing a far greater threat than illegal immigration?  You can imagine a kind of whipsaw effect that essentially ends American democracy as we know it: Democrats, in response to Trump, use extreme measures to advance their priorities. Then Republicans win an election and embrace even more extreme measures, and on and on until one party or the other decides to institute laws that make it impossible for the opposition to retake power. That's the who-knows-what that is at the very bottom of the slide we seem to be heading toward. As political scientist Yascha Mounk just wrote in Slate, ""Trump lacks the vision or the discipline of most of the authoritarian populists who have successfully bent their countries’ institutions to their will."" The danger may not be the current president but who comes after him. The way out of this bind is trickier to envision. Neither party's base seems to like compromise much in a hyper-ideological era with no unifying sources of facts. But without compromise you can't pass legislation (at least in this current system), giving rise to a situation where the president makes policy and the judiciary doesn't do much besides occasionally tell them ""no."" The silver lining, if there is one, is that as Trump just demonstrated, whether we're in an emergency is largely a matter of terminology. It's easy to use the language of crisis, to say that swarms of refugees are swamping the southern border or that America is on the brink of socialism or sliding into the sea or teetering on the edge of a never-before-seen catastrophe. It's harder to identify which one of those things are real, urgent problems and solve them through a regular political process that inevitably involves some compromise. Unfortunately, the president always takes the easy way out.  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

That could bring the company’s number of factories up to a total of five. “Later this year, we expect to finalize locations for Gigafactories 3, 4 and possibly 5 (Gigafactory 2 is the Tesla solar plant in New York),” Musk wrote. Tesla needs to increase its factory capacity to handle both battery and car manufacturing. The company received close to 400,000 preorders after unveiling its mass-market Model 3 vehicle last March, and fourth-quarter orders for its existing Model S and X vehicles increased 49 percent year over year, Musk wrote. Tesla plans to invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures before Model 3 production begins in July. Meanwhile, Tesla missed yet another production goal in 2016. The company expected to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 cars by the end of the year, but only delivered 76,230. Tesla attributed its miss to shifting to a new set of “2.0” sensors for its self-driving Autopilot feature. The company still produced 77 percent more cars in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in Q4 2015. This was Tesla’s first earnings report since its merger with SolarCity — an all-stock exchange valued at $2.8 billion — closed in November. Between the deal close on Nov. 21 and the end of the quarter, solar operations added $77 million in cash but $85 million in operating expenses. Yet Musk maintained the company is on track to generate $500 million in cash from its energy generation and storage business by 2019. That includes both its solar business in addition to revenue from Powerwall, its battery for homes, and Powerpack, its energy-storage product for businesses. Overall, Tesla beat Wall Street estimates for revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016, generating $2.28 billion in revenue, up 88 percent year over year, versus expectations of $2.16 billion. Shares increased about 2 percent in after-hours trading. On the call with analysts and reporters, Musk also announced that the company’s CFO was stepping down after a little more than a year. The company’s former CFO, Deepak Ahuja, will be coming out of retirement to replace him.

852,852,06-08-16 18:00,2016,8,6,Leif Johnson,Playing Early Copies of 'No Man's Sky' Is a Waste of Time,"All across the internet, players are managing to get their hands on early copies of the ridiculously hyped space exploration game No Man's Sky and posting videos of what they've seen. For many, as should only be natural for a game that's been burdened with so many expectations, the final product hasn't lived up to the dream. But in that regard, the damage has been done (and the fact that Sony is forcing news sites to remove footage via DMCA requests isn't exactly helping). But if one of those early copies manages to make its way to your door, you might be better off just waiting to play it with everyone else on the proper release date of August 9. If you're of a sentimental bent, consider the plea of poor Hello Games chief Sean Murray, who sent out a tragic tweet on July 29 after Reddit user Daymeeuhn posted over 30 minutes of footage on DailyMotion. He really, really doesn't want you to play it (or watch footage), you guys. ""We've spent years filling No Man's Sky with surprises,"" Murray said then. ""You've spent years waiting. Please don't spoil it for yourself :("" Yet there's a reason beyond pure spoilers. As Murray said in another tweet just last night: ""If you are reviewing/playing our game without our update, on a leaked copy, then please don't. It's not what players will experience."" Murray appears to be referring a Day One patch that could change much about the footage we've seen so far. Much of the uproar over Daymeeuhn's footage focused on the embarrassing number of bugs and glitches he showed or reported, such as sea creatures spawning vertically in the ground, missing or glitched upgrades, or the simple fact that Daymeeuhn was able to reach the center of the universe in only a couple days' time. Murray earlier told GameSpot it would take players ""hundreds of hours"" to reach that point if they did nothing else. Murray tweeted last Tuesday that he and his team were still at the office working on the patch at 5:00 a.m. after a month of preparing a patch that will bring ""Lots of new features, balancing and content."" What that means isn't exactly clear, but it'll almost certainly contain a decent amount of bug fixes. But here's the biggie: No Man's Sky is chiefly about exploration, about finding one in a ""quintillion"" planets and naming it all your own for other players to see while investigating their sometimes unique flora and fauna. Any planets you name so far are going away on Sunday, as Hello Games' Harry Denholm tweeted yesterday after Kotaku informed its readers that there was a planet named for it out there among the procedurally generated nebulae.  It's a good thing, too, as for a few hours No Man's Sky's launch should live up to that Star Trek-inspired dream of going where no one has gone before. ""Where no one has gone before except for some unscrupulous YouTubers"" just doesn't have the same bang.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7z9y/no-mans-sky-early-copies,Tech by VICE,Vice
853,853,21-06-19 00:00,2019,6,21,"Erwin Seba, Jessica Resnick-Ault",Explainer: Philadelphia refinery blast puts new spotlight on toxic chemical,"(Reuters) - Massive explosions that engulfed a Philadelphia refinery in flames on Friday have renewed concerns about the oil industry’s use of a highly toxic chemical to make high-octane gasoline at plants in densely populated areas.  Aerial video of the scene at Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc’s refinery, the largest in the northeast, on local television showed significant damage and the massive complex nearly engulfed in flames.  One of the explosions took place in a hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit - a chemical processing unit that has been involved in three near-misses of releases into cities in California, Texas and Wisconsin, according to safety officials.  Hydrofluoric acid (HF) can form a toxic cloud at room temperature while exposure can lead to severe health problems and even death.  Around the Philadelphia refinery, air quality had not yet been cited as a problem. There are about 300,000 people who live within three miles (5 km) of the facility.  There have been campaigns by residents who live near refineries, environmental groups and the country’s largest industrial labor union to end the use of HF in units that produce octane-boosting components for gasoline.  Fifty, or more than a third, of 135 U.S. refineries operate HF alkylation units, according to the Chemical Safety Board (CSB), which investigates industrial fires and explosions.  In April, the CSB called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to revisit a study on HF’s use and the potential to replace it with another process after hearing from worried residents during its probe of a 2018 refinery fire.  “Refinery workers and surrounding community residents are rightly concerned about the adequacy of the risk management for the use of hazardous chemicals like HF,” the board said in that letter, which grew out of the CSB’s probes of fires at refineries in Wisconsin, California and Texas.  The United Steelworkers union (USW), whose members work at major refineries, launched a campaign in 2010 to end the oil industry’s use of HF. In 2013, the USW found 26 million people in the United States were at risk of HF exposure from a refinery accident.   “We would like the industry to invest in finding intrinsically safer alternatives,” said Michael Wright, the USW’s director of health, safety and environment.   The oil industry has rejected calls to convert HF alkylation units to sulfuric acid, which does not form a low-hanging cloud that can drift into neighborhoods, saying the cost would be too high and alternatives not well developed.  HF has been used for about 70 years in refinery operations, according to Diana Cronan, spokeswoman for the trade group American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. About 2% of the HF used in the United States goes toward refining, she said.  “Typically, refiners with limited land availability have hydrofluoric acid” units, she said.   Sulfuric acid reactors can be two to three times as large as HF, Cronan added, making them less attractive to manufacturers.  But HF is risky because it forms dense vapor clouds low to the ground that can easily move into the communities around refineries. Since it destroys nerve tissue, burns may be initially painless. It can also cause cardiac arrest in higher concentrations.  Most of the 27,000 residents of Superior, Wisconsin, were evacuated in 2018 due to the risk of a release of HF following an explosion at Husky Energy Inc’s refinery, according to news reports at the time.  Husky has said it expects to resume partial operations at the site in late 2020.    A 2015 explosion at a Los Angeles-area refinery, then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, raised the risk that a storage tank containing HF could have been ruptured, according to the CSB.  The USW campaign began following a 2009 explosion on an HF alkylation unit at the Citgo Petroleum Corp refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, that the CSB found likely released up to 4,000 lbs (1,814 kg) of HF. Much more than that was contained by water spray cannons around the burning unit.  Before the Corpus Christi fire burned out, the water supply system was nearly exhausted and hoses bringing additional supplies ruptured but were quickly replaced or repaired, the CSB found.

What happened?,"Rival fantasy sports sites DraftKings and FanDuel announced a long-expected merger on Friday. It’s a deal that makes a lot of sense on paper: The two companies offer near-identical products, are fighting the same regulatory battles and can now spend time and resources building one business together instead of trying to tear each other’s businesses apart. But it’s not a secret in the industry that DraftKings CEO Jason Robins and FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles — not to mention their investors — don’t get along either publicly or privately. At least, they didn’t get along for the better part of the past two years. Now Robins is CEO of the new joint entity and Eccles is chairman, which means the two will be working together closely. Is this relationship going to work? “I think what I’ve said publicly about Jason is probably no worse than what I’ve said about my fantasy football buddies,” Eccles joked to Recode Friday in a joint interview with Robins. “We’re both entrepreneurs, we’ve both had visions of transforming this industry, so I think often when you’re a competitor you lose sight of that.” Okay. Robins? “To steal a sports analogy, you might have two players on opposite sides of the field that are very much friends and know each other well off the field,” Robins said. “I think Nigel and I always got along. We felt like we could always go grab a beer together, go grab dinner, and we’ve done that many many times.” Sounds like the hatchet has been buried, at least publicly. But while Robins has long called for a merger between the two sites, Eccles repeatedly said publicly that he wasn’t interested. He told my colleague Peter Kafka twice this year, as recently as May, that he didn’t see the need for a tie-up. Ultimately, the two companies realized they were actually fighting the same opponent: Regulators labeling their pay-to-play fantasy businesses as illegal gambling sites. “We pretty quickly realized that the biggest threats to our respective companies came from outside the industry,” Eccles said of his change of heart. “That allowed us to spend time together and [we] started to talk about the future of the industry and where we wanted to take our companies. What we realized was we had really shared visions.” A few logistical updates on the merger: This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2016/11/18/13677620/draftkings-fanduel-merger-jason-robins-nigel-eccles,,Vox

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads  The Forbes Pigment Collection at the Harvard Art Museums is an evolving archive of synthetic and natural pigments — each year brings additions representing innovations in color. One of the newest acquisitions is a sample of Vantablack, a superblack material which absorbs 99.965% of light. Senior Conservation Scientist Narayan Khandekar discusses the sample in the video above from Harvard University. Back in 2014, when Hyperallergic reported on the opening of the Straus Center for Conservation at the Harvard Art Museums, which made the pigment library freshly visible through glass, Khandekar said that the collection “was put together by Edward Forbes in an attempt to understand the material nature of works of art, and that approach to understanding art had not been taken before.” He added that it “was the beginning of the scientific approach for conservation in the United States.” Colleen Walsh at the Harvard Gazette reported that the Harvard sample of Vantablack is on a piece of crumpled aluminum, yet when seen through a protective box, the black appears like a flat void. It’s important to point out that while Vantablack is part of the Forbes Pigment Collection, it’s not accurate to call it a pigment. Its developer, Surrey NanoSystems, describes it as a “super-black coating that holds the world record as the darkest man-made substance,” noting that it was initially created for “satellite-borne blackbody calibration systems.” Claims have been made about even blacker materials, but it’s pretty darn dark, composed of vertical tubes that trap and deflect light and must be grown in situ. And it may have a role in art — although at this moment, the role is limited. Earlier this year, Claire Voon reported for Hyperallergic that Anish Kapoor had acquired the rights to Vantablack’s exclusive usage in art. Sadly, he has not chosen to coat his mirrored “Cloud Gate” with it in order to reflect the dystopic national mood (that was just an April Fool’s joke). Now at Harvard, nestled among the roughly 2,500 rare and historic colors like lapis lazuli and arsenic-based greens, Vantablack will at least be on hand for students who want to research this darkest of synthetic materials. Perhaps in some future setting, they will consider its influence on art.",https://hyperallergic.com/342566/vantablack-harvard-art-museums/,,Hyperallergic
856,856,18-04-18 00:00,2018,4,18,Timothy Gardner,EPA's Pruitt under spending probe; senators urge his ouster,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House budget office said on Wednesday it was probing whether a $43,000 soundproof phone booth installed for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt violated the law, while dozens of Democratic senators called for him to resign over allegations of ethics lapses.    Pruitt has been under fire for potential ethics lapses, including flying first class, excessive spending on security, and the rental of a room in a Washington condominium owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist.   The Office of Management and Budget is reviewing whether spending on the booth installed in Pruitt’s office broke a law prohibiting federal agencies from incurring expenses in excess of available funds, known as the Anti-Deficiency Act.    “We take the anti-deficiency statue very, very seriously and if (it’s) been broken, we’ll follow the rules,” Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers in a House hearing. “We will enforce the law, and we’ll do so in a transparent fashion.”    An OMB spokeswoman said the probe had already begun and her agency was working with the EPA on it.   The EPA’s approval of the phone booth violated both the anti-deficiency law and another requiring agencies to notify Congress when they obligate more than $5,000 in federal funds to make improvements in an office of a presidential appointee, the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, said on Monday.   Pruitt has said the phone booth is necessary for him to conduct official business. When asked about the OMB’s probe, Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, said his agency disagreed that spending on the booth required notification to Congress and said the agency is addressing the GAO’s concern.  President Donald Trump said this month that Pruitt, who has carried out his policy of slashing regulations on the fossil fuel industry, “has done a fantastic job.” Trump added that he will look into the allegations of ethical lapses.  Mulvaney said the anti-deficiency law is technically a criminal statute, but he did not know if anybody had ever been charged criminally with violating it.   Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized Pruitt over the allegations. On Wednesday, 38 Democratic U.S. senators and an independent who votes with them in the 100- member chamber introduced a resolution calling for Pruitt to resign.   Pruitt has “completely violated the trust of the American people and the standards of his office, with a list of ethical transgressions that grows longer by the day,” Senator Tom Udall said.  The Senate is controlled by Pruitt’s fellow Republicans. Although Republicans can defeat the resolution, it is symbolically important because it represents the most senators ever to call for a cabinet member’s ouster in such a petition, its sponsors said.  More than 130 U.S. representatives signed a companion resolution in the 435-seat House of Representatives.

860,860,03-08-16 15:00,2016,8,3,Libby Nelson,The first modern Olympic Games included one winner who'd never tried his sport before,"As the Olympics are about to get underway with the opening ceremony on Friday night, it's worth remembering how much they've changed. The first modern Olympic Games — which started 120 years ago —included something more commonly associated with entitled children than ancient Greeks: a participation trophy. All 250 participants went home with a bronze medal. That's not the only way the first modern Olympics, which revived a 1,500-year-old ancient Greek tradition, differed from today's glitzy, highly produced, occasionally corruption-soaked spectacle. Although the first modern Olympics were unrecognizable in many ways — there were no women, no national teams, and only nine sporting events — the story of the runup to the first modern Olympics sounds awfully familiar: The host country was in political turmoil, and hosting the event turned out to be much, much more expensive than anyone had anticipated. And just like today, some of the athletes had some incredible stories. In 1896, the American participants were a thrown-together group. There were no trials, very little time to prepare, and a team chosen based on, essentially, who could afford to get there. The first American Olympians were 14 men, mostly from the Boston area and from Princeton. The mother of one of the Princeton athletes paid for their travel. Two athletes had to drop out of Harvard in order to compete, because they weren't given permission to miss class in order for the Olympics. But the Americans ended up dominating the competition, winning 11 first-place honors — which were silver medals, because gold medals wouldn't be given out for another eight years. The Greeks had the second most victories. Athletes competed in 43 events in nine sports: swimming, gymnastics, track, cycling, wrestling, weightlifting, fencing, shooting, and tennis Robert Garrett, who won the discus event, had never used a real discus until he started participating in the competition. He'd had a blacksmith make him a practice version based on ancient Greek records; it turned out to be a foot wide and 30 pounds in weight, making it impossible to throw and more than 25 pounds heavier than the real thing. Garrett didn't find out what a discus really was until he got to Greece and saw the 8-inch, 4.4-pound discs the Greek athletes were practicing with. But he entered the competition anyway, and stunned the spectators and the other athletes — all of them Greek — by winning. Thomas Custis, one of the American athletes, described the win in 1924 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Technology Review: His first two attempts… were laughable, as the discus, instead of sailing parallel to the ground, turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts, he, himself, joining in the general merriment. ""On his third and last throw, however, he succeeded in getting the discus away perfectly and, to the chagrin of the Greek champion who had made three perfect throws in the most graceful manner possible, it was found that Garrett's throw exceeded by some two feet the best throw of any other man. I think no one was more surprised than Robert Garrett himself. But the Greeks got their own dramatic moment at the marathon, an event created for the 1896 Olympics (although distances weren't as precise). According to Custis, 30 athletes started but only seven finished — and the winner, in two hours and 58 minutes, was a Greek water carrier named Spyridon ""Spyros"" Louis: All contests then in progress were temporarily stopped to await the arrival of the winner. In the course of a few minutes a tremendous cheering was heard outside the gate of the Stadium, and a man in the dress of a Greek peasant ran up the steps and onto the track, making his way towards the King's throne, in front of which had been placed the finish line. His appearance showed the tremendous effort that he had made, and the fearful ordeal he had undergone. He was covered with dust and grime, the sandals that he wore on his feet were in rags, and his drawn face showed the strain he had suffered. His name was ""Loues"""" and he was a Greek donkey driver from the little town of Marousi. As soon as the people were able to recognize him, the cheering and clapping of hands that broke forth was deafening. Hundreds of pigeons which had been kept concealed until then were set free, with Greek flags tied to their feet, hats were thrown in the air, the Crown Prince walked onto the track and congratulated Loues, and all the pent up enthusiasm that the Greeks had been saving up during the past six months for this very event, broke loose with a vengeance. Louis became a national hero and will soon be featured on a Greek €2 coin — an even bigger deal than the honor for most modern Olympic champions, a Wheaties box.",https://www.vox.com/2016/4/6/11372204/first-modern-olympic-games,,Vox

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank is “insulated from short-term political pressures,” as policymakers wrestle with whether to cut rates.  The comments came after St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said he does not think the U.S. central bank needs to cut interest rates by a half-percentage point at its next meeting in July.  Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,423.26 per ounce as of 2:36 p.m. EDT (1836 GMT). Prices had touched a high of $1,438.63 in the session, a level last seen in May 2013, and were set for a sixth straight sessions of gains.  U.S. gold futures were little changed on settlement at $1,418.7.  “The whole gold move (higher) was on the back of the Fed’s signal to cut rates by 50 basis points in the last FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.  “Now, Bullard and Powell’s comments are going against that and Trump’s wishes. It is probable that gold might continue paring gains to until the G20 meeting.”  The comments lifted the dollar and pressured gold, prompting bullion to turn negative briefly, after it had rallied more than 1% earlier in the session on the back of expectations of monetary easing by the Fed and a subdued dollar.  Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, and gold had gained nearly $100 in value since the Fed’s statement last week that hinted at monetary easing.  Meanwhile, tensions between Iran and the United States lifted demand for safe-haven gold. Investors also watched for further cues on trade negotiations between Washington and China at the G20 summit.  “People have been buying what they feel could be an additional haven on more upcoming volatility caused by global economic pullback, the tinder box of the Middle East with Iran, and the G20, which may not bring the (trade) deal with China that everybody is expecting,” said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management.  Indicating investor interest in gold, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.37% on Monday, after posting their biggest percentage gain in nearly 11 years on Friday.  Among other precious metals, platinum declined 0.71% to $804.25 per ounce, while silver dipped 0.5% to $15.36. Palladium slipped 0.5% to $1,527.01 after hitting its highest level since March 26 at $1,551, earlier in the session.  Reporting by Karthika Suresh Namboothiri and Diptendu Lahiri

865,865,18-12-18 12:00,2018,12,18,Sarah Kliff,"Emergency room bills: what I learned from reading 1,182 ER bills ","For the past 15 months, I’ve asked Vox readers to submit emergency room bills to our database. I’ve read lots of those medical bills — 1,182 of them, to be exact. My initial goal was to get a sense of how unpredictable and costly ER billing is across the country. There are millions of emergency room visits every year, making it one of the more frequent ways we interact with our health care system — and a good window into the health costs squeezing consumers today. I started my project focused on one specific charge: the facility fee. I found this charge for walking through an emergency room’s doors could be as low as $533 or well over $3,000, depending on which hospital a patient visited and how severe her case was. I also learned that the price of this charge had skyrocketed in recent years, increasing much faster than other medical prices for no clear reason. But given the volume and diversity of bills I received, I’ve learned so much more. I’ve read emergency room bills from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. I’ve looked at bills from big cities and from rural areas, from patients who are babies and patients who are elderly. I’ve even submitted one of my own emergency room bills for an unexpected visit this past summer. Some of the patients I read about come in for the reasons you’d expect: a car accident, pains that could indicate appendicitis or a heart attack, or because the ER was the only place open that night or weekend. Some come in for reasons you’d never expect. Like the little girl who swallowed a coin to hide it from her sister, the 12-year-old boy who was hit by a home run ball at a professional baseball game (who, incidentally, was given a $60 ibuprofen at the local children’s hospital), and the adult who ate an entire bag of chocolate candy … without realizing it was edible marijuana. Rest assured, they are all fine! In so many ways, patients find themselves in a vulnerable position during these encounters with the health care system. The result is often high — and unpredictable — bills. Hospitals are not transparent about the cost of their services, their prices vary wildly from one ER to another, and it’s hard to tell which doctors are covered by insurance (even if the hospital itself is covered). In many cases, patients can’t be certain what they owe until they receive a bill in the mail, sometimes weeks or months later. I’ve also learned that there is a lot of interest in fixing these types of situations. Since we started this project, multiple senators have introduced bills to prevent surprise emergency room bills — including one directly inspired by our project. I’ll stop collecting emergency room bills on December 31. But before I do that, I wanted to share the five key things I’ve learned in my year-long stint as a medical bills collector. One bill that left an impression on me came from a woman seen in the emergency room the day after her wedding. Her eye was irritated from the fake eyelashes she’d worn the night before, and she worried that her cornea might have been scratched. The providers checked out her eye, squeezed in some eyedrops, and sent her home. She later got a bill that charged $238 for those eyedrops, a generic drug called ofloxacin. According to GoodRX, a website that tracks drug prices, an entire vial of this drug can be purchased at a retail pharmacy for between $15 and $50. This is something that I saw over and over again reading emergency room bills: high prices for items that a patient could have picked up at a drugstore. I see this a lot, for example, with pregnancy tests. They happen in emergency rooms for good reason: Doctors often need to know whether a woman is pregnant to determine her course of care. But the prices I’ve seen for pregnancy tests are really high. The bills in our database include a $236 pregnancy test delivered in Texas, a $147 pregnancy test in Illinois, and a $111 test in California. The highest price I saw? A $465 pregnancy test at a Georgia emergency room. For that amount, you could buy 84 First Response tests on Amazon. Or look at the price of a common antibiotic ointment called bacitracin (you might know it better by its brand name, Neosporin). The bills in our database show that one hospital in Tennessee charged a patient a pretty reasonable $1 for bacitracin — while another hospital in Seattle charged $76 for the exact same ointment. Since prices aren’t made public, it was impossible for these (or any) patients to know whether they were at a hospital that charges $1 for a squirt of antibiotic ointment or one that charges 76 times that amount. These bills submitted to our database were in situations where there was not a life-threatening emergency, where a provider presumably could have sent the patient to a place where their drug is available cheaper, often over the counter. But that doesn’t seem to happen. Perhaps emergency room providers don’t know the price of the care they provide, either. Instead, patients are getting drugstore items in the emergency room at a significant markup — and paying higher bills as a result. On January 28, 34-year-old Scott Kohan woke up in an emergency room in downtown Austin, Texas, with his jaw broken in two places, the result of a violent attack the night before. Witnesses called 911, which dispatched an ambulance that brought him to the hospital while he was unconscious. Kohan, who submitted his bill to our database, ended up needing emergency jaw surgery. The hospital where he was seen was in network; he Googled this on his phone right after regaining consciousness. But the jaw surgeon who saw him wasn’t. Kohan ended up with a $7,924 bill from the surgeon, which was only reversed after I wrote about his bill in May. Kohan’s case is something I see regularly in our database: patients who end up with big bills because they went to an in-network hospital but were seen by an out-of-network doctor. Here’s how that happens: When doctors and hospitals join a given health insurance plan’s network, they agree to specific rates for their services, including everything from a routine physical to a complex surgery. Doctors typically end up out of network when they can’t come to that agreement — when they think the insurance plan is offering rates that are too low but the insurer argues that the doctor’s prices are simply too high. Unless states have laws regulating out-of-network billing — and most don’t — patients often end up stuck in the middle of these contract disputes. Academic research has shown that most of these types of bills actually originate from a small number of hospitals. These bills “aren’t randomly sprinkled throughout the nation’s hospitals,” one New York Times article from July 2017 noted. “They come mostly from a select group of E.R. doctors at particular hospitals. At about 15 percent of the hospitals, out-of-network rates were over 80 percent, the study found.” These surprise bills appear to be especially common in Texas, where Kohan lives. As many as 34 percent of emergency room visits lead to out-of-network bills in Texas — way above the national average of 20 percent. And, much like the bills with high prices, these bills are really hard to prevent. Out-of-network doctors won’t often mention that they don’t accept the patient’s insurance; they might not even know. And patients often have little choice about where to receive their care — like Kohan, who needed emergency jaw surgery due to his attack. Before I started reporting this project, I knew from my decade as a health care reporter that America has sky-high medical prices. But what I didn’t know was that patients can face steep bills even if they don’t see a doctor or have their ailment treated. They can decline treatment and still end up with a hefty fee. I learned about this from a bill sent to me by Jessica Pell. She told me about going to an emergency room in New Jersey after she fell and cut her ear. She was given an ice pack but no other treatment. She never received a diagnosis. But she did get a bill for $5,751. “It’s for the ice pack and the bandage,” Pell said of the fee. “That is the only tangible thing they could bill me for.” After I saw Pell’s bill, I started looking through our database and finding similar bills from other patients. They all ended up with significant medical bills, in the hundreds or thousands of dollars. These fees were often on top of additional fees from another health care provider where they ultimately did receive treatment. This is all due to the key fee I’ve been investigating this year: the ER facility fee. This is the fee that ERs charge for walking in the door and seeking care, something akin to a cover charge at a bar. Hospital executives often argue that these fees help them keep the lights on and doors open for whatever emergency might come in, anything from a stubbed toe to a stroke patient. But experts who study emergency billing question how these fees are set and charged, noting that they are seemingly arbitrary, varying widely from one hospital to another. A Vox analysis of these fees, published last year, shows that the prices rose 89 percent between 2009 and 2015 — rising twice as fast as overall health care prices. “It is having a dramatic effect on what people spend in a hospital setting,” says Niall Brennan, the executive director of the Health Care Cost Institute, which provided the data for that analysis. “And as we know, that has a trickle-down effect on premiums and benefits.” Since I started working on this project, one of the questions I get most frequently is: How do I avoid a surprise ER bill? Or how can I get my ER bill lowered? I wish I had a good answer, but I don’t. Patients are usually at the mercy of the hospital when it comes to ER billing. I have talked to some patients who have successfully negotiated down their emergency room bills. Most of those people applied for financial aid, requested a prompt pay discount, or found an error on their bill. Some especially savvy patients have even had luck arguing that their facility fee charge was coded incorrectly — that the hospital used a billing code that should be reserved for really intense, complex visits when their visit was actually pretty simple. I’ve noticed that these patients tend to have a doctor in their family who can help them make this type of argument. Most patients who have successfully negotiated down a bill tell me it wasn’t easy. Erin Floyd from Florida told me about her experience reducing two of her daughter’s bills — one by 90 percent and one by 45 percent — through a combination of financial aid and prompt care discounts. On the one hand, she was happy to have the bills lowered. In total, she ended up saving $4,369. On the other hand, the whole process was exhausting. There were lots of phone calls and faxes involved. “I spent at least three hours on the phone working on this,” she says. “I was scanning, faxing, emailing, all while I was at work.” Over email, she described it as an “incredibly stressful and long process.” And then there are, as Slate has noted, patients who have had their bills reversed after journalists wrote about them. Our project, for example, has resulted in $45,107 in medical bills being reversed after Vox began inquiring about those charges. But for all of investigative journalism’s merits, reporters writing about medical bills isn’t a great solution for the health care system’s woes. What stands out to me is that in all these cases, it’s essentially the hospital that gets to decide whether it wants to negotiate or reverse a bill. And if a hospital says no? If it won’t change the facility fee code, or doesn’t offer a prompt payment discount? The patient is essentially stuck. The hospital has the trump card: It can send the bill to a collection agency, a move that could devastate a patient’s credit. In those situations, there isn’t anything a patient can do to stop them. As more journalists write about ER bills, there is a growing outcry on Capitol Hill — and more senators on both sides of the aisle who want to do something about it. There are now two proposals in Congress that would make the types of bills I write about a thing of the past. One comes from Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and another from a bipartisan group of senators including Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO). While the two bills aim to do the same thing (prevent surprise bills in the emergency room), they take different policy approaches. The Cassidy-McCaskill proposal essentially bars out-of-network providers from billing patients directly. Instead, they would have to seek payment from the health insurer, who would be required to pay a price similar to local market rates. (I’ve written in greater detail about how this works.) Will either of these bills become law? It’s hard to tell. On the one hand, the safest bet with Congress is often inaction. But this issue seems to be gaining momentum. Just this week, for example, a large coalition of health plans and consumer advocates put out a statement supporting federal action on the issue. What’s more, there is bipartisan interest in working on this — making it the rare issue that just might bring Democrats and Republicans together on health care.

Police officers who heard the gunfire descended on North 15th Street and East Wilder Avenue, where, about 200 yards away from a bus stop, cops found the body of Anthony Taino Naiboa on the sidewalk. A week later, Tampa Police officials don't have any serious leads or a clear motive in Naiboa's killing. But they believe the person who shot the 20-year-old autistic man also murdered 22-year-old Benjamin Mitchell and 32-year-old Monica Hoffa, two people who lost their lives earlier this month in the same vicinity. Mitchell was shot on October 9 around 9 PM while waiting for a bus. Hoffa's body was found four days later in a vacant lot about half a mile from where the two men were killed, after she disappeared two nights earlier.  ""When you look at the time frame, the proximity, that there is no apparent motive, that the victims are alone at the time, it's clear to me that they are all linked,"" interim Tampa police chief Brian Dugan told reporters in a press conference last Friday. The three homicides have fueled speculation that a serial killer might be prowling for victims in Southeast Seminole Heights, prompting police to provide escorts for children and the distribution of light bulbs to illuminate front porches in the neighborhood. The red beret–wearing Guardian Angels are even patrolling sidewalks.  Still, at the same press conference, Dugan was cryptic when asked if the murders were the work of a serial killer. ""We can call it what we want,"" he said. ""If that brings attention to it, that's fine."" Three days later, at a community meeting attended by 400 people, Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn promised the perpetrator would be caught, but stopped short of using the term ""serial killer."" ""We need you to call us and let us know what's going on,"" Buckhorn said. ""That's how we're gonna catch this guy. And we will hunt this son of a bitch down until we find him!"" Sherry Genovar-Simons, a Southeast Seminole Heights homeowner for 25 years, said there is a heightened sense of awareness in her neighborhood. Still, she's not exactly terrified. ""Obviously, we are not dumb enough to go out at night by ourselves,"" she said. ""I am not going to walk down the streets with my dogs at eight o'clock or nine o'clock in the evening like I usually do. But I am also not going to sit in my house and quake.""  Florida certainly has a long and sordid history with serial killers. In January 1978, Ted Bundy—who by then was responsible for dozens of murders in at least six states—broke into a Florida State University sorority house, where he attacked four young women, bludgeoning two of them to death. A few weeks later, Bundy abducted his final target, a 12-year-old girl named Kimberly Leach, whom he raped and beat to death. Soon after, Bundy was arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced to death for the three Florida murders. He was executed in January 1989.  Eleven months later, Aileen Wournos began a year-long campaign of terror across the Sunshine State during which she murdered at least six men. She was arrested in January 1991 and subsequently confessed to the killings, which were allegedly targeted at men who sexually assaulted her. She was executed by lethal injection in 2002, ten years after her conviction. Historically, though, Southeast Seminole Heights has not been a magnet for violent crimes, according to Genovar-Simmons, who served as president of the neighborhood civic association four years ago. ""Most of the crime that I am aware of are crimes of opportunity like people breaking into cars or an unlocked home,"" she said. ""We have never had any big crime sprees. I could go out to my car at two o'clock in the morning and never had any fear.""  Homicide experts canvassed by VICE said the three murders in Southeast Seminole Heights this month do bear some characteristics pointing to a serial killer. But they suggested the perp might be more accurately described as a spree killer—the distinction being that the latter snuffs out two or more victims at multiple locations with almost no break between the crimes.  Most fundamentally, Scott Bonn, a criminology professor at Drew University who authored the 2014 book,  Why We Love Serial Killers, said the fact Naiboa, Mitchell and Hoffa rode the bus and were killed within a one-mile radius of each other amounted to a ""rather uncanny pattern."" ""This may be a mission killer,"" Bonn said, adding, ""He or she could be trying to terrorize the community. That may the goal. It could be an individual who feels disenfranchised in some way and is sending out a message that says, 'The world will recognize me,' by committing these murders.""  Nelson Andreu, who worked six serial-murder cases during 20-plus years as a Miami Police homicide detective, wondered if Tampa cops had concluded the bullets used in the three Seminole Heights murders came from the same gun. ""If they have recovered projectiles or casings that match, then the police can say without any doubt that it is the same killer,"" Andreu said. ""Some killers want you to know that they are serial in nature.""  Andreu, who is now chief of the West Miami Police Department, believes the Tampa Police Department has done a good job of informing the public about the danger posed to the community. ""They are using a lot of manpower and community outreach to thwart this suspect before he or she strikes again,' he told me. Rather than notorious serial killers like Bundy, Bonn, and Andreu both cited the Washington, DC, sniper attacks of 2002 when trying to make sense of the Tampa situation. Over a period of about three weeks, John Allen Muhammad and teenager Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people and critically injured three others across Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.  ""It has the earmarks of a spree killing,"" Bonn offered of the Tampa saga. ""It is happening in a very short time frame, and there is no cooling off period between the murders. Serial killers tend to have protracted cooling-off periods."" Andreu suggested serial killings usually have some sort of sexual undertone to them. ""There is a deviancy of some sort at play,"" he told me. ""In Tampa, that is missing. The killer is just walking up and shooting people. It reminds me of the two guys who were just picking off people in DC."" As the New York Times reported, some other experts think the days in between these incidents amount to enough of a cooling-off period to apply the serial killer label, assuming the three killings were the work of the same person. During the community meeting on Monday, Tampa's Chief Dugan told the standing-room only crowd at Edison Elementary School that they had to dispel any preconceived notions of what a serial killer might look or act like. ""When I think of a serial killer, I think of Ted Bundy,"" Dugan said. ""But here is the problem. It may not be a white person and it may not be a male. How do we know there is not two step brothers living in a house and they are doing it together? Let's not let labels and stereotypes box in our vision and miss what is right in front of us."" Mayor Buckhorn has been a bit less careful with his language. ""Bring his head to me, all right?"" he ordered police officers Wednesday in a video aired by NBC News. ""Let's go get it done."" On Thursday, police released a new video showing what they described as a person of interest (rather than a suspect) brandishing what appeared to be a phone and, later, running in the area on the night Mitchell was shot. For her part, Genovar-Simons said she didn't want to speculate about whether the suspect is indeed a serial killer. ""The police seem to think it might be,"" she said. ""Usually, we don't have murders, especially three so close at one time. There is definitely something strange about it.""

871,871,20-01-17 21:00,2017,1,20,Zack Beauchamp,Trump’s inaugural address showed that he’s serious about his radical foreign policy,"Anyone expecting Donald Trump to give a conciliatory, open-minded inaugural address was sorely disappointed. America’s 45th president began his term with a dark, fire-breathing speech assailing America’s governing elite and pledging to rededicate Washington to “the people.” His rhetoric about the rest of the world was equally, if not more, aggressive: Trump questioned America’s historical commitment to free trade and argued that defending longstanding allies wasn’t necessarily in the best interests of the US. “For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military,” he said. “From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.” This vision is, as Trump himself said, a break with a decades-old bipartisan consensus on how Washington should interact with the rest of the world. It’s also exactly what he promised on the campaign trail. Trump has a bit of a reputation as a flip-flopper. But he’s been remarkably consistent on his core view of the world — that all of international relations is transactional and should be motivated solely by assessments of what's better, financially, for the US. That has led to some of his more controversial policy pronouncements, from threatening to withdraw US troops from Japan and South Korea unless the countries pay more the costs of those deployments to hinting that he’d ignore the NATO treaty and only defend members of the alliance who’d spent more on their militaries. Trump may not act on his ideas; his picks for the Pentagon, State Department, United Nations, and CIA are notably more hawkish and committed to NATO and other traditional alliances. Still, this speech, and everything Trump has said before, is a declaration of intent to radically revise America’s role in the world. Throughout the campaign, Trump came back to the same two-word description for his foreign policy view: America first. “America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,” he said in a foreign policy address way back in April. Trump repeated this phrase, almost ritually, during his inaugural address. It’s a handy mantra for the way he sees the world. The phrase has its origins in a 1930s-vintage pressure group of the same name that opposed America’s entry into World War II. The America Firsters were isolationists, whose overarching belief was that America needed to disconnect from the world in order to preserve its independence and prosperity. Some prominent members, like aviator Charles Lindbergh, actively sympathized with Nazism — a stance that soon discredited the group entirely. Trump has told reporters that he knows this history and that his use of the phrase isn’t intended to signify any connection to the discredited slogan and movement. Still, his basic, overarching vision of US foreign policy idea is strikingly similar to that of many of the America Firsters of yore: He thinks that America’s current close ties to the rest of the world, particularly Europe, are at best a distraction from, and at worst a threat to, the interests of the American public. “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,” he said in the inauguration speech — implying that’s not what happened prior to 2017. This is most obvious when it comes to Trump’s view of trade. In his mind, America’s current economic ties to foreign countries like China and Mexico are harming US workers. He gave a whole speech on this theme back in June. So he made backing away from free trade, and moving toward protectionism, a major part of his inaugural address. “We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs,” he said. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.” You see a similar “America first” theme when it comes to Washington’s military alliances. Throughout the campaign, Trump argued that the United States was doing too much to protect allies capable of defending themselves and openly wondering whether the US gets enough from countries like Japan and South Korea to bother keeping tens of thousands of troops there to defend them. He jarred European allies back in July, meanwhile, by openly speculating that the US might not defend NATO members that Trump felt had “not fulfilled their obligations to us.” Here, Trump’s notion of “America first” becomes clearer. He doesn’t believe, as many international relations scholars do, that these alliances more than pay for themselves by promoting peace and increasing American leverage over other countries. What matters isn’t long-term stability outside the US; it’s whether the United States is being paid enough, in a very clear pecuniary sense, for its military deployments and security commitments. The world is a zero-sum game; the prospect that the US and its allies could both lose doesn’t seem to have crossed his mind. The inaugural address was more of the same. When Trump talked about America’s global commitments, it wasn’t about the vital role America plays in promoting peace and prosperity. It was the amount of money the US wasted on its allies and foreign wars, which he thinks trades off with more important work at home (like keeping out immigrants from Mexico). “We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay,” Trump said. “We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.” These ideas were, unsurprisingly, immensely controversial during the campaign. Since World War II, the United States helped build a global order centered, in large part, on both free and open trade and a series of defensive alliances aimed at preserving peace. Trump has promised to, if not upset this order entirely, at least chip away at it significantly — throwing the globe into truly uncharted waters. This inauguration speech shows that this wasn’t an act or some grand con. This what Trump (and whoever wrote his speech) actually thinks. But a speech is just that: a speech. The trick with Trump, as my colleague Matt Yglesias notes, is not just to listen to what he says — it’s to see what he actually does. And the truth is that, intentions aside, extricating the United States from trade and alliance commitments it set up is a lot more complicated in practice than it sounds on paper. Tearing up free trade agreements like the US pacts with China could very well slow economic growth or even trigger a recession. America’s national security establishment will lobby vigorously against any attempt to weaken NATO or other US military alliances to them. So will some key members of Trump’s own team, like soon-to-be-confirmed Defense Secretary James Mattis. Indeed, you already saw a little bit of walkback from “America first” policies in Trump’s inaugural. At one point, Trump nodded at the vital nature of America’s existing alliances, a clear sign that his team is worried about the heat he’s drawn for his positions on NATO, Japan, and the rest. “We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones,” Trump vowed in the inaugural, a near direct contradiction with his broadside against “[defending] other nations' borders” earlier in the speech. What’s more, Trump has set up some impossible expectations for his radical new foreign policy approach. He promised, among other things, to eliminate jihadism entirely: “[We will] unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth.” I don’t want to spoil anything, but Trump won’t in fact get rid of every militant terrorist group on Earth. He may weaken them more than Obama or Bush did (though I have my doubts on that point), but it is literally impossible for him to destroy each and every single militant Islamist group, or even just all of the major ones. Yet these are the metrics that Trump is setting up for himself. He’s promising a radical revision to American foreign policy and to accomplish all sorts of extraordinary things by doing it. The people who wanted a more toned-down Trump might be disappointed, but the ones who have long liked what they’ve seen from him — who felt like his angry populism is just what America needs — doubtless loved what they heard. Yet they may not love what they eventually see.",https://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/20/14337956/donald-trump-inaugural-address-transcript-foreign-policy,,Vox
872,872,03-05-18 17:20,2018,5,3,Tara Golshan,2018 midterm polls: Republican voters prioritize national security over the economy,"Americans tend to vote first and foremost on the economy — except this year, Republicans have a different top priority: national security. A recent poll from Morning Consult surveying more than 275,000 registered voters across the country from February through April of this year, shows 35 percent of Republican voters see security as their top policy issue going into the 2018 midterm election cycle, closely followed by the economy, which 29 percent of Republican voters listed as their top policy issue. “Senior’s issues,” likely including Social Security and Medicare, as well as health care issues follow. Democrats and independent voters, however, largely still identify the economy as their highest priority when picking their candidate. Notably, security and health care are the second and third priorities for independent voters, while for Democrats, health care is almost as important as the economy (24 percent and 22 percent). Security is fourth behind senior’s issues for Democrats. Here’s the breakdown from Morning Consult: The poll shows a slight divergence from the narrative around the 2016 election, after which many pundits on the right and left wing of the Democratic Party attributed President Donald Trump’s ascension to economic anxiety. But even in the presidential election, security issues were important. According to a report from the Pew Research Center, 90 percent of Trump supporters said the economy was “very important” to their vote in 2016. Eighty-nine percent of Trump voters said the same of the issue of terrorism. But that Republican voters this year are most concerned about security issues, even more so than jobs, is a notable development — especially as the national Republican Party continues to put its new tax law front and center. Trump, too, has claimed credit for the stability of the economy. (As Vox’s Matt Yglesias explained, the economy is not too different from the end of the Obama era. The main difference is that Trump now says it’s good.) His administration’s national and foreign security record is less steady; recent staffing shake-ups did away with traditional Republican figures in favor of more hawkish voices on the right, with appointments like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. Meanwhile, Democrats have prioritized health care in 2018 campaigns and attacked Republicans for giving corporations and the wealthy a massive tax break.",https://www.vox.com/2018/5/3/17314664/2018-midterm-polls-policy-priority-voters,,Vox
873,873,26-06-19 00:00,2019,6,26,,More than half Chinese consumers shun U.S. goods due to trade war: survey,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - More than half Chinese consumers have avoided buying anything made in the United States in support of their country in an escalating trade war, a survey suggests, posing a “significant” risk to U.S. companies.  The poll, conducted by London-based advisory firm Brunswick which surveyed 1,000 Chinese consumers, said 56% of respondents had said they had avoided U.S. products, while 68% said their opinion of American firms had become more negative.   “This poses a significant bottom line risk to U.S. companies as three in four Chinese consumers say they often buy products from American businesses,” Brunswick said on Wednesday.   The world’s two largest economies have been caught up in a bruising trade war which has seen both sides slap tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s exports, hurting businesses and stoking concerns among firms that they could be caught up in the cross-fire.   U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are set to meet for the first time in seven months at this weekend’s G20 summit in Japan, but prospects for progress in the trade talks look slim.  Brunswick also surveyed 1,000 U.S. consumers for their opinions on China. It said that American opinions of Chinese companies were worsening and that 60% of respondents had noticed price increases on household goods since tariffs were increased.

874,874,11-01-19 22:10,2019,1,11,Aditi Shrikant,Uber and Lyft are not as popular in rural America as they are in cities,"When Uber and Lyft released their subscription services last year, each said that its program was a step toward moving America away from being a car-dependent society. “We’ll own cars the way we own horses,” author of The Membership Economy Robbie Kellman Baxter told me. “It’s a folly, it’s a fun thing, but it’s not the way we get around.” Of course, ride-hailing services are fully behind the elimination of car ownership, as that would improve their bottom line, but some gig economy and transportation experts, like Baxter, also believe that eventually all mobility will be subscription-based. Cornell University infrastructure policy program director Richard Geddes has said that trading in car ownership for a subscription model would be more economically viable for many Americans and is probably the way the automotive industry is going. “Car ownership is so inefficient,” he says. “Families are not good at owning cars. They are not good at buying them, not good at selling them, and not good at maintaining them.” However, a Pew Research Center report shows that there is an urban-rural divide among Americans regarding ride-hailing usage. According to Pew’s findings, 19 percent of Americans living in rural America use ride-hailing apps, while in urban and suburban America, those numbers are 45 and 40 percent, respectively. In urban areas, 19 percent of users take Ubers weekly, while in rural areas it’s just 5 percent. The theory is that ride-hailing is a gateway to subscription-based mobility, which, paired with self-driving cars, is supposed to be the transportation of the future. A report by Research and Markets stated that now until 2022, the subscription-based car model will experience a compound annual growth rate of 71.38 percent. This could including booking a car for a specific amount of time, but also plans like Uber’s and Lyft’s. Eventually, perhaps, no one will own a car and AVs will be picking us up at the push of a button. But does the theory still hold up with such dismal user numbers in rural areas, which make up one-fifth of the country’s population? According to a 2015 Verge article, Uber covers about 75 percent of the US, but getting to 100 would mean infiltrating smaller towns and rural areas. In 2017, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Uber has near-statewide coverage in 13 states, and Lyft, in order to fill in the spots that its competitor doesn’t cover, announced that it was now available in 40 states and 94 percent of Americans could access it. However, the LA Times found this wasn’t wholly true. On a Wednesday night in New York’s Finger Lakes region, few cars appeared on the map. And in Corning, New York, the closest Lyft ride was 74 miles away and showed no estimated time of pickup. Technological infrastructure is one of the biggest challenges in rural areas. Uber and Lyft both depend on good cell service, something that can be spotty in small towns. In a 2018 study investigating the rural-urban ride-hailing divide in Pennsylvania, author Rhoda C. Joseph says that expansion of cellular and broadband technology “may have the most significant impact” when it comes to reaching smaller towns. The study also noted that the possession of a credit or debit card is a requirement of all drivers, which could also deter Americans who only use cash. Baxter also says this could be a big reason why rides-hailing apps aren’t thriving in rural areas. “In my work with other apps, when targeting rural areas I saw how unreliable rural broadband is,” she wrote via email. She adds that the routes drivers take in rural areas also don’t foster a need for Uber or Lyft. “Rideshares are most economical when the distance is short and the parking fees high,” she says. “Not likely to be the case for a rural ride.” Uber message boards frequently discuss how small town driving is much less lucrative. One driver in Davis, California, wrote that she earned $18 for more than two hours of work. So not only is expanding to rural areas fiscally precarious for Uber and Lyft, it also may not reap much reward for drivers. Rural-friendly ride-hailing alternatives have emerged in the gaps Lyft and Uber leave. One Nebraska-based ride-hailing service named Liberty Mobility Now tried to satisfy the needs of rural cities in Ohio, Texas, and Nebraska where Uber and Lyft were not yet available. It operated differently than Uber and Lyft: The service had a call center so those who didn’t have access to smart devices could still hail a car. According to NPR, drivers were also encouraged to form relationships with their clients, something that often doesn’t happen in Ubers or Lyfts. In Athens, Ohio, Liberty was the first ride-hailing service the city had. However, the company declared bankruptcy after being sued by an investor for supposedly misrepresenting finances. Suzanne Ashe was once the only Uber driver in Haines, Alaska — population 1,374 — and said she kept getting kicked off the platform because there weren’t enough people asking for rides. She also found that some places weren’t on Uber’s maps, so clients couldn’t enter their destination, and internet could be spotty. For these reasons, Ashe quit Uber and started her own ride-hailing business called Red Cab, named for her 2010 Red Chevy HHR, the only car in her “company.” She charges a flat rate of $10 per ride and $30 per hour. “In order to cater to rural areas, especially areas where there isn’t a saturation of network, then a cab company makes a lot more sense,” she told Chilkat Valley News. Despite the many obstacles, Geddes believes that autonomous, on-demand rides will eventually replace personal car ownership, and says the discrepancy between urban and rural usage mostly has to do with market penetration. “What you’re seeing in the data looks like some symptomatic differentiation, but it’s really just the fact that these services were first introduced in markets that would yield the most profit to the company,” he says. In other words, it’s not the regional differences in credit card and internet access that’s holding back Uber and Lyft in rural areas; it’s the simple fact that ride-hailing apps aren’t available. The aforementioned 2018 study also found that rural areas could be lucrative for Uber and Lyft. In the study, Joseph determined how ready each county in Pennsylvania was to adopt ride-hailing by assigning each one an RSI (ride-sharing index). RSIs were calculated using four variables: median income, population density, unemployment, and licensed drivers. The study proposes that when all these variables are high, a country is more likely to embrace ride-hailing. The study shows that 75 percent of Pennsylvania counties are equipped to support a ride-hailing economy. With 72 percent of Pennsylvania being rural, the data suggests that there is untapped potential in rural areas. However, with shoddy internet and small payouts for drivers, it may be hard for rural communities to embrace ride-hailing the way cities do. Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?

A copy of the truce agreement seen by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ""each side will keep the territory under its control."" Kurdish authorities and media said this meant territory taken from government control would not be returned. Related: Kurds Battle Assad's Forces for Second Day in Syria's Qamishli The agreement said that employees of the Syrian state must not be threatened, deprived of their salaries or recruited into joining ""local protection units that belong to the regime"". Damascus maintains a strong administrative presence and still pays government employee salaries in Qamishli, one of the largest cities in Hasaka province in Syria's far northeast corner adjoining Turkey and Iraq. The agreement said the structure of pro-government forces stationed in Qamishli would be reviewed and Damascus would no longer interfere in local society, but provided no further information elaborating on these measures. Compensation would be paid to civilians who lost relatives or suffered material damage in government shelling, it added. Qamishli sits near Syria's border with Turkey and at the base of Turkey's Taurus Mountains, a great chain that extends cuts through southern Turkey. It is mostly controlled by Kurdish security forces. Pro-Assad government forces still maintain control over a few areas in the city's center, including its airport. But Syrian Kurdish forces dominate wide areas of northern Syria, and have set up their own government there. Syria has become a patchwork of areas controlled by the government, an array of rebel groups, Islamic State militants, and Kurdish militia. Meanwhile, mediators are struggling to keep a nationwide truce in effect. All warring factions are mired in distrust, and suspect one another of breaking the cessation of hostilities deal, which was brokered on February 27. On Friday, Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, estimated that about 400,000 people had been killed over the last five years of civil war.

877,877,04-05-17 20:10,2017,5,4,Callie Beusman,"After Passing 'Cruel and Deadly' Healthcare Bill, the GOP Celebrates with Beer ","The bill, which has been called ""cruel"" and ""horrific,"" would threaten the coverage of over 24 million Americans, eviscerate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, decimate Medicaid expansions, and defund Planned Parenthood. It's now headed to the Senate, where ""it awaits an uncertain fate,"" according to Politico. Many of the provisions of the replacement healthcare bill threaten women's access to basic healthcare, with low-income women and women from marginalized populations particularly burdened. In addition to stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funding, the new healthcare bill would eliminate guaranteed coverage of essential health benefits like maternity and newborn care and mental health care, and allow insurance companies to charge patients higher premiums based on their medical history—which would be particularly harmful to women, as rape, domestic violence, and C-sections are all considered preexisting conditions. Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, called the bill ""cruel and deadly"" in a statement. ""If this bill is signed into law, the suffering will be widespread, needless, and cruel: hospitals will close... families will go bankrupt paying healthcare costs, and women will be charged more than men for coverage that doesn't even guarantee maternity care,"" she said. Advocates from reproductive rights groups decried the legislation as part of a larger, politically-motivated attack on reproductive health, noting that Trump also signed an executive order today that would allow employers to deny contraception coverage to their employees under the guise of religious freedom. ""I am terrified for my patients and for the health of this country,"" said Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, an advocacy fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""As a physician, I know that patients and families suffer when they are unable to obtain comprehensive, compassionate health care. Congress should be ashamed to pass legislation that puts health care out of reach for millions of Americans."" Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, cited the House vote as a particularly egregious example of the GOP's ""commitment to punishing and burdening women."" ""When they undermine and take away the healthcare we need as women, they're clearly saying that women and our ability to plan and care for our families are not their priority,"" she said in a statement. ""Giving money to their rich friends is."" According to accounts from reporters in D.C., it seems that Republicans will celebrate the passage of the bill by drinking cartloads of beer.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvdkvq/after-passing-cruel-and-deadly-healthcare-bill-the-gop-celebrates-with-beer,Identity,Vice
878,878,30-05-18 00:00,2018,5,30,Eileen G'Sell,Bruce LaBruce Misfires with an Awkward Marriage of Punk and Camp,"The provocative auteur’s latest, The Misandrists, attempts a tongue-in-cheek critique of radical feminism. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads “Sisters, we must tell the world to wake up and smell the estrogen!” So says Big Mother (Susanne Sachsse) in an Isabella Rossellini drawl to her dutiful Female Liberation Army acolytes, a ragtag platoon of punks, preps, and pig-tailed femmes training in the Bavarian outback in Bruce LaBruce’s latest film, The Misandrists. Though the movie is (somewhat incongruously) set in 1999, the credo feels very timely. At first glance, the film resembles a rompish battle cry against the crimes of patriarchy, a B-movie bacchanal for the lesbian separatist, and a shameless parody whose excesses are intrinsic to its charm. The problem? Though LaBruce fancies himself a feminist, his vision of radical separatism often feels equal parts Born in Flames and Girls Gone Wild. Calling his latest feature “a critique of any extremist kind of movement — both on the left and right,” the director feigns a take-no-prisoners mindset while kowtowing to cis-gender male visions of non-stop sapphic snogging (his cinematographer, tellingly, is also male). However it critiques ideological extremes, the film’s half-hearted embrace of opposing aesthetic and affective poles convolutes more than it calls to arms. The movie launches promisingly enough, its Pepto-Bismol font curling across the credits in the spirit of Sofia Coppola’s The Beguiled (a film to which LaBruce’s bears striking plot similarities, if you swap the white-gowned maidens for surly lesbians in matching knee-high socks). Accompanying a piano refrain uncannily reminiscent of Jewel’s “Foolish Games”, the cursive opening titles set against the sight of a secluded country estate suggest a tongue planted firmly in cheek (though it is planted upon a great range of orifices over the course of the film). For its first 20 minutes, the film seems a risible — if predictable — send-up of essentialist feminism; the FLA gals close their dinner prayer with “A-(wo)men” and shun all things male with stilted disgust. But as contempt for the patriarchy fills every utterance, the spoof gets as platitudinous as the rhetoric it intends to mock — maybe even more so, as there’s something about the intensity of Shulamith Firestone and Valerie Solanas that is pretty darn enjoyable. “Equal rights. Equal to whom? To the patrimonial male ruling class who has relegated us to the dustbin of history?” As Big Mother drones on at the dinner table, her subjects (including performance artist Kembra Pfahler) seem just as listless as we are. “Are we satisfied now with an equal distribution of injustices? To be granted equality only by agreeing to be equally as exploitative, extraordinate, and corrupt? Equal participation in an iniquitous society is incommensurate with womancipation.” If LaBruce’s point is how monotonous radical feminism can be, I can’t help but wonder if we — in 2018 — really need a 90-minute film to show us that? Tedium can be a productive means of cinematic deviance, but after a soft-lit, slow-motion pillow fight goes on for three full minutes, do we really need a similarly filtered orgy in a later scene? It’s not that none of this is entertaining at first; it’s that it’s only entertaining at first. The Misandrists misfires not because it lampoons grave subject matter, but in how lazily and unevenly it does so. We first learn that the girls of the FLA are “victims of sexual abuse” during a humorous speech from Big Mother (costumed as a nun, no less) to a police officer inquiring about the missing male renegade (Til Schindler) hidden in their cellar. But when hornball Helga (Lina Bembe) presses comrade Isolde (Kita Updike) for dirt about one of their schoolmates, her deadpan explanation of each girl’s history of exploitation is hardly played for laughs. Rather, a close-up of each stares blankly at the camera as we learn of their rapes, assaults, traumatic pregnancies, and sex work. Is this camp or a PSA? Perhaps LaBruce can’t tell the difference. Filmed outside Berlin and funded largely by a Kickstarter campaign, The Misandrists may turn out to be another low-budget cult classic, with LaBruce following the tradition of John Waters, Todd Solondz, and Gregg Araki before him. But in 2018, this supposedly punk-rock take on New Queer Cinema just doesn’t feel that punk, or that new. Where others have deftly mixed their cocktail of camp, cruelty, and crass humor, LaBruce’s tonic feels flat and undershaken. Where art thou, Dawn Wiener, the transcendent Divine, or arguably any character with a pulse? The New York Times’s Teo Bugbee said of the film, “[H]ere is queer cinema: confrontational, pansexual, gender-fluid, racially inclusive, angry and surprisingly romantic.” Granted, its racial (and trans) inclusivity is laudable. But with its nubile, shaven, itty-bitty-tittied female cast, the movie’s portrayal of lesbian desire looms perilously close to hetero-centric schoolgirl porn. Moreover, the movie’s rancor and romance never seem sincere enough to leave a mark. When at last its end credits appear onscreen — black-and-white photos chronicling a history of all-female protest movements, from turn-of-the century suffragettes to Black UCLA alumnae in the 1960s  — the leap in tone feels the cinematic equivalent of trying to spoon after an interminable hand job. For all its money shots and graphic violence, the only thing truly shocking about The Misandrists is how ultimately boring it becomes.  The Misandrists is currently playing at the Village East Cinema (181-189 Second Avenue, East Village, Manhattan) in New York City and opens on June 1 at Landmark’s Nuart Theatre (11272 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California).",https://hyperallergic.com/445157/bruce-labruce-the-misandrists-film-review/,,Hyperallergic
879,879,09-12-17 14:30,2017,12,9,Lewis Gordon,Björk’s Beautiful 'Utopia' Is Hopeful in the Face of Decay,"In a 2003 documentary, there’s a moment where Björk Guðmundsdóttir describes her early memories of singing and songwriting. Björk tells the interviewer that, walking to and from school in Iceland—sometimes in blizzards, sometimes in howling winds—she would map out melodies to the landscape. “You could be all quiet and whispery and sneak down next to the moss and sing a verse,” she said. “And then you could stand up and run to a hill and sing a chorus. You had to do that quite loudly because the weather was strong.” Björk’s work has always worked in conjunction with the nature of a place, never against it. But  Utopia, her latest album, might be the first time she has attempted to create an entirely new ecology, a new system of connections. It is both fiercely political and intimately personal.  The timing couldn’t be more pertinent. On the November 13, more than 15,000 scientists signed a document simply titled “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice,” detailing how deforestation, agricultural production, and the burning of fossil fuels are all continuing to contribute to the irreversible devastation of the biosphere. Another recent report asserted that carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere at record speed last year, while the sixth mass extinction event is already underway. The population groups of billions of species will be wiped out in the process. Collectively, these processes are beginning to be recognized by scientists as the Anthropocene, a newly formulated geological epoch in which the detritus of humanity is observable in the makeup of the world. These processes display, at best, a disinterest in the natural world and, at worst, contempt for anything non-human. Now, though, Björk has returned with a window into a possible future, one where the writing isn’t yet scratched indelibly into the wall.    Utopia opens with gentle birdsong and an unwinding synth scrawl that sounds like an animal darting from the speakers. Björk sings “and just that kiss was all there is” before the song erupts into a soupy, primordial ecstasy. She’s called Utopia her “Tinder album,” a response to her previous record, 2015’s  Vulnicura, documenting her break-up with long-term partner, Matthew Barney. This isn’t inner-city Tinder, though—awkward dates, casual sex and painful small talk—this is Björk Tinder, an emotional openness with everything. The first track, “Arisen My Senses,” sounds like the artist emerging from a particularly long, painful period in her life. Lead single “The Gate” begins with the sound of wind, water, and the cooing of the strange, floating life forms in its video before she sing-song chants, “I care for you, care for you.”  That Björk has infused ecological concerns with such emotion, twinning it with her own rediscovered openness, shouldn’t be surprising. She’s never used nature as window dressing. On her 1997 single “Jóga,” she bellows “emotional landscapes” amidst deep, windswept cellos and beats that threaten to crack open the earth’s crust. It’s a love song but the relationship is as fractious and beautiful as the Icelandic landscape itself. 2001’s  Vespertine, meanwhile, took the clicks of pointillist micro-rhythms—delicate, cellular creations—as the starting point to delve into her own interior, a counterpoint to the expansive, outward-looking  Homogenic released four years prior.   On the surface, it’s  Biophilia that appears closest to  Utopia in outlook. On the former, Björk paired elements of music with naturally occurring phenomena, like arpeggios with lightning or chords with tectonic plates. Ten apps—one for each track and simple enough for children to use—were released, designed to explore each facet of the natural and musical world. It was informed by a deep research period including her attendance at the National Geographic Explorer Convention in 2009. Accompanying videos even included the narration of the twentieth and twenty-first century’s great environmentalist hero, David Attenborough. Then, in the accompanying press shots, she appeared to inhabit the entire cosmos, draped with constellations and clutching the deep past of crystalline rock formations. With  Utopia, though, Björk seems less interested in a grand universalism and more content with forging living, breathing connections.   The pristine masks, designed by James Merry, that have adorned Björk’s face throughout  Utopia’s promotional phase might be the physical manifestation of the album’s concerns. Appearing less like masks and more like biological fusions between herself and other organisms—part plantlife, part anemone—they’re unsettling creations channeling something verging on body horror. The album cover itself takes the transformation further. Her skin and face have changed texture and color—protrusions grow out of her forehead and around the nose—highly sexual (not sexy) armor readied for battle. Tucked in the ribbing of her neck is a sleeping baby animal—impossibly cute. It’s an unflinching declaration of love—a willingness to cleave off part of her own identity for another and, in the process, create something new.  Her 2015 collaboration with eco-philosopher, Timothy Morton—a series of letters—hinted at these ideas. Morton’s work has long advocated a fundamental reevaluation of our relationship to the natural world (indeed, for Morton there is no natural world, only the world). Kicking back against the apocalyptic doom-mongering of mainstream media, his looping, dense prose methodically argues for a state of coexistence with all ecology. In one letter to Björk, he says, “I think that there is a connection in your work between self-care and care for other beings” while in another, trying to figure out an appropriate-ism for Björk (at her request), he sheepishly ventures “pan-eroticisim,” a gleeful mirror to the seedling masks and album artwork.   The single from 1997’s  Homogenic, “All Is Full Love,” is a precursor to much of this thinking, a song of almost impossible generosity. Just as techno-futurism courses through that video, so too does it pump through her and Morton’s work. Their response to ecological crisis isn’t a retreat into primitivism but instead an unflinching, wholesale embrace of technologies. “You think ecologically tuned life means being all efficient and pure,” reads Morton’s 2016 pinned tweet on Twitter. “Wrong. It means you can have a disco in every room of your house.” Björk pins part of her outlook on Iceland’s distinct, historical development. She says the country missed much of the industrialization the rest of Europe experienced and instead careened from its 1944 independence into the full blown “green techno internet age.”  Björk already appears to be done with that era, though. The cybernetic naturalism of previous records has given way to  Utopia’s eco-fantasia and it’s telling what she’s decided to take with her. The chirping of Venezuelan and Icelandic birds will be audible in this future, even if they might not make it much longer in the present. Their inclusion feels aggressively defiant. There’s space, too, for an all-female twelve-piece flute orchestra who give  Utopia its air-light feel and sonic openness. Researching the record, Björk delved into the mythological stories of Africa, South America, Indonesia, and Iceland. In each of those regions she found stories of women who had fled hardship with their children, some of them nabbing flutes in the process. Usually, they’d meet a sticky end at the hands of their male oppressors but this time around, Björk has changed the ending. On the final track she sings, “Imagine a future…. Feel this incredible nurture, soak it in… Watch me form new nests, we’ve made a matriarchal dome.”  It might seem like the corniest thing in the world but Björk holds true to the idea that we can only care for the earth by caring about each other. In the early noughties she said, “I’ve always been 1000% certain that I was an atheist and I’m slowly starting to realise that perhaps I have a religion and it’s nature.” Like other religions, the grace of the natural world touches every aspect of her life—Björk’s ecological concerns find expression in her personal interior. On “Body Memory”, she transcends the grief of her dissolved relationship, partly through finding solace in the environment. “The moss that I’m made of, I redeem myself,” she sings, awakening from the break-up and isolation of  Vulnicura. The openness and love she’s discovered isn’t just confined to humanity, it extends like a mantra into the future. In Björk’s world, there’s no room for the apocalypse or eco-fatalism, just the shimmering promise of something better. It is colossally hopeful.

After Donald Trump himself intervened just a day into his presidency, a government photographer cropped out the empty space where the crowd ended in some pictures of the inauguration, according to public documents obtained by The Guardian.   The president was apparently angered by a photo circulating on Twitter that showed his audience was smaller than the crowd Barack Obama drew in 2009. The photo comparison was shared by the official National Park Service Twitter account. A crowd scientist said the Trump inauguration drew roughly one-third the attendees at Obama’s.   Trump’s anger sent NPS staffers scrambling on Jan. 21, 2017, to meet his demands, following phone calls from both Trump and Spicer asking for better representation of the crowd’s size. It’s not clear whether the original photos were released publicly, or which photographs were edited.   The acting NPS director, Michael Reynolds, called an NPS communications official to say that Trump wanted different pictures from the inauguration. The communications official noted that the images released so far depicted “a lot of empty areas” and said she had the “impression that President Trump wanted to see pictures that appeared to depict more spectators in the crowd.” She added that she “assumed” the photos needed to be cropped, although Reynolds didn’t request that specifically. She contacted an NPS photographer, who later told investigators that he was asked for “any photographs that showed the inauguration crowd size.” He said he was asked to go back to his office and “edit a few more.”   “He said he edited the inauguration photographs to make them look more symmetrical by cropping out the sky and cropping out the bottom where the crowd ended,” investigators for the inspector general said, according to the documents obtained by the Guardian, adding, “He said he did so to show that there had been more of a crowd.” In the administration’s first-ever press briefing following Trump’s inauguration, then-press secretary Sean Spicer angrily referenced blown-up crowd pictures on the screens behind him, claiming the event drew “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration — period” after members of the media reported otherwise.

According to court documents reported on by Postmedia, they then went on to discover that the man who had been billed as having an IQ of 160, with various degrees and working toward a PhD in neuroscience engineering, actually had been diagnosed in 2000 with schizophrenia, narcissistic personality disorder, a drug-induced psychotic disorder and significant grandiose delusions. He had also been hospitalized for mental health reasons and arrested several times while he was a donor, according to published reports. His IQ was actually 130, and he had only recently graduated with a bachelor's degree.  The lawsuit alleges that Xytex did not properly screen Aggeles. ""Xytex had a commercial motive to sell Aggeles's sperm, and it pursued that motive by promoting and selling the sperm of Donor #9623 irrespective of whether or not he was a suitable sperm donor,"" the lawsuit says, according to Postmedia.  In one of the Vancouver cases, the couple claimed they turned to Genesis, which gave them the option of receiving sperm from three companies, one of which was Xytex, according to Postmedia. They had their first child in 2008, and their second and third were born in 2011. Another Vancouver woman claims her child was also born with the same donor. Responding to the Ontario lawsuits in April, Xytex lawyer Ted Lavender told VICE News that the company looked forward to successfully defending itself. ""Pursuing claims in a court of law requires actual evidence and proof,"" he said. ""Making unfounded allegations in the court of public opinion requires no actual proof at all, but merely the word of the very lawyers and litigants who already failed in a court of law.""Xytex is an industry leader and complies with all industry standards in how they safely and carefully help provide the gift of children to families who are otherwise unable have them without this assistance.""",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/gy93z7/more-families-are-suing-a-sperm-bank-after-genius-donor-was-allegedly-a-schizophrenic-ex-con,,Vice News
882,882,21-08-17 23:45,2017,8,21,Kurt Wagner,A new study says more teens than expected are leaving Facebook for Instagram and Snapchat,"Teens are leaving Facebook faster than expected, according to a new study from research firm eMarketer. The study estimates that Facebook’s user base among 12- to 17-year-olds in the U.S. will shrink by 3.4 percent in 2017, the first time eMarketer has predicted a decline in Facebook usage for any age group. The company said that it “reduced its usage estimates” for Facebook, but didn’t originally include what the previous estimates were and did not immediately reply to a request for clarification. The firm also said its estimates for usage among users 18- to 24-years-old “will grow more slowly than previously forecast, too.” Regardless of what they were, a revised slowdown is obviously bad news for Facebook. Update: An eMarketer spokesperson sent along prior growth estimates from Q1. The firm originally expected Facebook’s 12- to 17-year-old audience to grow by 0.7 percent this year. It predicted Facebook’s 18- to 24-year-old user base would grow by 0.8 percent. The good news? Lots of the teens leaving or forgoing Facebook are turning to Instagram instead, which Facebook owns. Snapchat, too, is stealing some of Facebook’s teen audience. In fact, eMarketer believes that Snapchat will be bigger than both Facebook and Instagram in the 12- to 17-year-old and 18- to 24-year-old categories by the end of the year. That would be a first. “Both [Instagram and Snapchat] have found success with this demographic since they are more aligned with how they communicate — that is, using visual content,” eMarketer analyst Oscar Orozco was quoted on the company’s blog. Snapchat will grow by 19.2 percent this year in the 18- to 24-year-old demographic, eMarketer estimates. Instagram is expected to grow its 12- to 17-year-old audience by 8.8 percent. This is not the first time Facebook has been saddled with a “teen problem.” It has been almost four years since Facebook first hinted on a company earnings call that the social giant’s teen audience was decreasing. The news sent its stock down after an otherwise positive earnings report, and people spent years wondering if Facebook had a problem retaining its young users. That whole exercise proved a bit exaggerated. Since those comments were made, Facebook has added more than 800 million monthly users, and its stock has more than tripled. But the concern, of course, is that Facebook will lose out on the next generation of internet users, and with them, a lot of valuable eyeballs for advertisers.

883,883,06-11-17 00:00,2017,11,6,Pete Schroeder,Head of U.S. government financial agency to resign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a U.S. government agency created to monitor financial markets after the 2007-2009 financial crisis will resign from the post at the end of this year.  Richard Berner, director of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), will be leaving that agency on Dec. 31, the Treasury Department announced on Monday. Berner helped create the agency as a Treasury official under President Barack Obama, and has led it since its creation in 2013.  The Treasury did not say who would replace Berner, but his exit gives President Donald Trump another opportunity to shift government watchdogs in a more industry-friendly direction.   Berner helped establish the agency as a Treasury Department official before becoming its first and only director. He is leaving roughly one year before his current term expires in  January 2019.  “After six years of commuting between Washington, D.C., and my home in New York, I have decided that it is time for me to go home to my wife and enjoy time with our grandchildren who have graced our family since I came to D.C.,” Berner said in a statement.  A full-time replacement would need to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.  The agency, created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, was charged with gathering data and analyzing trends across financial markets, in an effort to help sniff out looming threats before they jeopardize the economy. Housed within the Treasury Department, it lends its expertise to regulators tasked with guarding against such sweeping risks.  But the agency has come under pressure from Republicans, who have argued it is redundant and should not be allowed to compel financial institutions to hand over data for analysis. A sweeping rewrite of financial rules passed by the House earlier would have eliminated the agency, but it is not expected to pass the Senate and become law.  And the Trump administration proposed in May slashing its budget by 25 percent and urging a “staffing streamlining ... for maximum efficiency.”   Before Berner’s exit, existing openings across financial regulators already lingered. The Senate has been slow to advance, and Trump slow to nominate, new officials to fill some roles occupied by Obama officials, suggesting it could be some time before a new full-time OFR chief is in place.  Before joining the Obama administration, Berner had spent several years as a Wall Street economist, working as the co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, and chief economist at Mellon Bank. He previously worked on the research staff at the Federal Reserve.

The success of the Switch will depend on Nintendo’s “ability to market a clear use case message to the audience,” Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst with IHS, told VICE News. “Nintendo failed to do this with the Wii U and paid the price.” The new console won’t go on sale until March, and we don’t yet know how much it will cost or what what games will launch with it (though we do know that Mario and Zelda are coming). And we know that Nintendo really needs the Switch to be a hit. While the success of the Pokemon Go mobile game is giving Nintendo at least the perception of relevance (the game is actually owned by Niantic Labs), the Wii U flop allowed its console gaming business to be destroyed by Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox, which have sold 50 million and 30 million units, respectively. It will be interesting to see market reaction to Nintendo’s announcement, but the Tokyo Stock Market was already closed at publication time, so we’ll have to wait until Friday morning to get a full response. On Thursday’s news that Nintendo was going to unveil the Switch, the company’s share price jump as much as 4.5 percent before closing up 3.3 percent at the closing bell. The failure of the Wii U led the company to reassess its business model, and for the first time ever it has started creating games for smartphones. Following the launch of the social game Miitomo, the company and analysts expect big success with the launch of Mario December (20 million people have already signed up for the game before it is even available). It has signed a deal with Japanese mobile gaming company DeNA to produce another three games based on Nintendo characters. However, if the Switch console fails to compete with the PlayStation and the Xbox, the company will have to reassess again. “Another flop in launching new hardware should be a sign that Nintendo is better off providing its rich game-title franchises to smartphones, Sony, and Microsoft,” Serkan Toto, a Tokyo-based game consultant, told the Wall Street Journal.",https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4qew/nintendos-new-console-is-like-if-game-boy-and-wii-u-had-a-baby,,Vice News

886,886,28-09-18 17:30,2018,9,28,Vesla Mae Weaver,The Brett Kavanaugh hearings show who we afford a second chance and who we don’t,"First-person essays and interviews with unique perspectives on complicated issues. “I do not understand why the loutish drunken behavior of a 17-year-old high school boy has anything to tell us about the character of a 53-year-old judge,” said conservative commentator Rod Dreher. “He was an immature high schooler. So were we all,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT). “I wouldn’t disqualify anyone from higher office because of anything they had done as a minor,” said Washington Post opinion writer Megan McArdle. These are arguments of a chorus of voices suggesting that even if the charges of three women who claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted or harassed them have merit, they should still not derail his appointment to the nation’s highest legal and moral authority. (Kavanaugh denies the allegations.) We are a nation of second chances, for some more than others. This is a topic I’ve researched as a scholar of criminal justice, racial inequality, and American democracy. Consider how our system approaches youthful delinquency. If the accusations against Kavanaugh are true, they provide an extreme example of someone ascending to the peak of their professional career, having evaded punishment for serious criminal offenses and predatory behavior toward women. But the extreme example actually rests on a more pervasive phenomenon — namely, the under-enforcement of the criminal law against some groups of offenders. We tend to think the criminal justice system contains few errors of this sort, that those who engage in a pattern of serious lawbreaking come to heel. But there is a large share of Americans who break the law and instead encounter “maximum tolerance.” Studies document that while affluent white youth are just as likely to possess and use drugs as their poorer counterparts, they are much less likely to be locked up. They enjoy not just freedom from police interference of minor transgressions, but what I would term a kind of super freedom — the rational expectation of no adjudication even when they commit serious, violent, assaultive behavior. They live in spaces, attend schools, and play on streets largely walled off from police. Simply put: White affluent youth experience less accountability for criminal offenses compared to their black and brown counterparts and poorer non-whites, and the lessons both groups learn at this formative age carry on into their adult lives. A 2014 study of a New York suburb of affluent whites found that just shy of two-thirds of youth committed an offense that should have triggered an arrest. Yet very few — just 22 percent — were picked up by police, and only a small share of those have experienced formal adjudication for their crimes. In my own forthcoming study using representative longitudinal data of youths, I found that non-Hispanic white youths who committed offenses, ranging from breaking and entering to vehicular theft, to destruction of property and selling drugs, had a very low probability of arrest. In this study, we found that 5 percent of white youth admitted to committing a violent assault; of these, they had better than a coin toss’s odds of not being charged with an offense. Fewer still were convicted or jailed. Conditional on crime, white youth offenders have diminished risk of contact with police, courts, and jails relative to youth of color, and they needed to commit more offenses to get caught up in the system. When it comes to everyday interactions with police, young people of color have it far worse. Due largely to the reach of police into everyday spaces that deal with youth, particularly schools (more than a quarter of which employ uniformed police), following the law offers little protection against police contact or arrest for black and brown teens. Unlike their white counterparts, they are considered suspicious for mundane, noncriminal behaviors — their style of hair or dress, teeth too gold, pants too low. Michael Brown, who was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, was violating a “manner of walking” law in the municipal code. In a large nationally representative study, 45 percent of black boys reported being stopped by police by early adulthood (compared to 23 percent of all kids). The findings of a big black/white gulf were “robust to controls for peer and family circumstances.” Under-enforcement conveys a powerful lesson to youth in their formative years: Even as assailants, white youth they know they are viewed and regarded as upstanding, law-abiding, and good boys who just had a little fun. They imbibe the lesson that our legal system and culture is willing to give them a pass. And because most youth “age out” of criminal offending, this group has probably avoided punishment and adjudication for the rest of their lives. Without criminal or arrest records, they will go on to enjoy entrance to college, obtain promising employment, and earn access to credit all without the worry of being encumbered by their past. The rhetoric on the right around the Kavanaugh allegations represents a large group whose crimes are disconnected from punishment. These “false negatives” say much about our system of justice, especially when paired with the other side of the coin — those who have done nothing wrong but are especially likely to experience being stopped by police, being convicted of an offense, or be jailed. Qualitative accounts of policing black and brown youth underscore that these early encounters give a lasting memory of the state’s potential for violence against your person or community. These youths learn that government sees them as potential assailants deserving of oversight, not kids being kids. As one Los Angeles man recounted in our study of police experiences: The first time the police stopped me I was 11 years old and they stopped me ‘cause I was playing water balloon fights, with my friends, during the summer. And, um, they handcuffed all of us, they paraded us in front of the community, they had the helicopter on us, and this was like a group of 11 year olds. Like, nobody was older than 13. And, like, they had guns on us, like they pointed a gun to my head, and they threatened our lives … afterwards, even though we were kids, like, the entire communities [sic] thought that we were up to something bad. Second chances are less likely too. Those who were arrested were much less likely to be diverted from criminal punishment than white kids, and they faced steeper sanction for identical offense patterns. In contrast to white spaces, police are thoroughly entrenched in the lives of youths of color and the institutional fabric of their neighborhoods. It’s also the case that police and the general public do not see black kids as kids. One study shows that police evaluate black boys as four years older on average than they actually are. Additionally, political leaders often do not see youth as having parents capable of effective discipline. I once sat next to a mainstream criminal justice expert who unblinkingly told me that the US polices black kids more heavily than white ones even though drug offending was similar in both places because “we can’t trust the parents to handle those kids.” It is fascinating to observe how easily we deploy arguments about second chances, regrettable choices that shouldn’t get in the way of one’s ambitions, and formal statutes of limitations in confronting serious criminal offending among a certain class of kids. But when the youth in question are of darker hue and lesser means, we slide into claims of personal responsibility and accountability, term them “superpredators,” and lock them away. Police encounters with young adolescents do not separate the bad from the good; they distinguish the kids growing up without resources and in areas of high surveillance from the rest. Delinquent kids in more affluent places do not avoid police because they are law-abiding, but because our system does not target them. The rhetoric we now see from the mostly white, mostly male GOP leadership is consistent with the lesson that our legal system unofficially but powerfully imparts: that their presumptive innocence will be a shield to them even when they are guilty of grave harm. It’s a refusal to abide by the very rules they set for other populations. We’ve known this for some time and have done little to counteract it. It’s time to call it out.

The dollar rose 0.4% to 108.37 yen, extending its recovery from near six-month low of 106.78 set last Tuesday.  The Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, fell 0.3% to 0.97915 franc to the dollar.

After meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sideline of Group of 20 summit, Trump said he would hold back on tariffs and that China will buy more farm products.  Trump also said the U.S. Commerce Department would study in the next few days whether to take Huawei off the list of firms banned from buying components and technology from U.S. companies without government approval.

888,888,26-07-18 02:26,2018,7,26,Umair Irfan,Wildfires have killed more than 70 in Greece and ignited in the Arctic,"It’s so hot, even parts of the Arctic are on fire. Temperatures this month reached 86 degrees Fahrenheit well inside the Arctic Circle in Sweden, where the worst fires the country has seen in decades are now burning. More than 50 fires have ignited across the country, forcing evacuations. Finland and Norway are also fighting flames. “This is a serious situation and the risk for forest fires is extremely high in the whole country,” Jakob Wernerman, operative head of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, told the Associated Press. So far, no deaths from wildfires have been reported in Scandinavia, but Greece hasn’t been so fortunate. The country has declared a state of emergency as raging forest fires have killed at least 81 people and injured more than 190. “There are no words to describe the feelings of all of us, these times,” said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during a televised address Tuesday. “The country is going through a tragedy.” The government suspects arsonists may be behind the fires. But there’s also been intense heat across Europe this summer, and climate scientists say we can expect more of this extreme weather with global warming. #NOAA20 satellite captured the devastating fires around #Athens #Greece last night which have already caused significant loss of life and severe damage to the area. Winds over 50 mph contributed to the rapid spread of the deadly fires. pic.twitter.com/otHw6Wzt6L High temperatures forced the Acropolis to close for several hours this week. The Greek government can close public attractions when temperatures reach 96.8°F, according to the Associated Press. Greece’s intense heat has helped dry out shrubs and trees, making them more likely to ignite. The heat and drought pattern is similar to that playing out much further north in Latvia and Sweden. Parts of Italy are also on fire. Earlier this year, enormous fires scorched Siberia. Sweden is facing forest fires.We have helped mobilise two firefighting planes from Italy and two from France via #EUCivProThis is solidarity in a Europe that protects. #rescEU #EUProtectsFootage by @emergenzavvf pic.twitter.com/uzfGnEpene Across Europe, fire risks remain high in the coming weeks, according to the European Forest Fire Information System: While warm temperatures and dry conditions crop up sporadically throughout Europe during the summer, it’s highly unusual that so many places are experiencing such hot, dry conditions for so long at the same time: The big difference between the heatwaves of 1976 and 2018.June 1976: the UK was one of the warmest places relative to normal across the globe, with most areas cooler than average.June 2018: the UK was just another warm blob in a mostly warmer than normal world.#GlobalHeatwave. pic.twitter.com/eIsj7glEiE A corollary is that summers also spark wildfires in Europe on a regular basis, but rarely in so many places at the same time. As for the rest of the world, heat this summer has already proved deadly in countries including Japan, Pakistan, and Canada. Despite thousands of miles and an ocean in-between, many of the same trends behind the ongoing wildfires in Colorado, Oregon, and California are at play in Europe. As in the United States, Europeans are also building in increasingly fire-prone regions. Humans are also igniting most of these conflagrations. As the climate changes, the fire season is getting longer, now stretching from June through October in Europe. We saw this play out late last year as Hurricane Ophelia sent stiff winds through Portugal and Spain, driving wildfires that killed more than 100 people. The European Environment Agency reported that “an expansion of the fire-prone area and longer fire seasons are projected across Europe.” Very saddened by the tragic forest fires in Greece. Europe will stand by our Greek friends in these difficult times. Help is on its way from several EU countries. Several European countries are now chipping in to help put out the fires. Sweden is getting assistance from France, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, and Italy, who are contributing fire trucks, firefighters, soldiers, and water-bombing aircraft. The European Union is also mobilizing support staff and equipment to fight fires in Greece under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.",https://www.vox.com/2018/7/24/17607722/wildfires-greece-sweden-arctic-circle-heat-wave,,Vox
889,889,05-07-19 00:00,2019,7,5,,Guards commander says Iran should seize UK oil tanker if Iranian vessel not released: Tweet,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran should seize a British oil tanker if an Iranian tanker detained off Gibraltar earlier this week is not released immediately, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said in a tweet on Friday.  British Royal Marines seized the supertanker Grace 1 on Thursday for trying to take oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions, a dramatic step that drew Tehran’s fury and could escalate its confrontation with the West.  “If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities duty to seize a British oil tanker,” said Revolutionary Guards Major General Mohsen Rezai, who is also secretary of Iran’s Expediency Council, a powerful state body.  “Islamic Iran in its 40-year history has never initiated hostilities in any battles but has also never hesitated in responding to bullies,” Rezai said on his Twitter account.   Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Thursday that the Iranian oil tanker was carrying crude oil from Iran, according to the state news agency IRNA.  The Grace 1 was impounded off Gibraltar, a British territory on the southern tip of Spain, after sailing around Africa, the long route from the Middle East to the mouth of the Mediterranean.   While the European Union has banned oil shipments to war-torn Syria, a close ally of Iran, since 2011, it had never seized a tanker at sea. Unlike the United States, Europe does not have broad sanctions against Iran.

890,890,02-07-19 00:00,2019,7,2,,Trump announces nominees to fill two vacant Fed seats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the names of two nominees to fill vacant posts on the Federal Reserve Board, after two of his earlier choices withdrew from consideration in the face of criticism.  Trump said on Twitter he intends to nominate Christopher Waller, an executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Judy Shelton, the U.S. director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Both nominees must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Before joining the Fed Bank in St. Louis as research director in 2009, Waller was an economics professor at the University of Notre Dame.  Shelton, who served as an economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has advocated a return to the gold standard.  Trump has been critical of the Fed, and Chairman Jerome Powell in particular, for raising interest rates.  Trump says he wants lower rates to better compete with China and has accused Powell, whom he appointed to lead the central bank in early 2018, of doing a “bad job.”  Trump’s earlier choices for the Fed seats, economic commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Herman Cain, withdrew from consideration.  Cain pulled out in mid-April after lawmakers expressed discomfort with the sexual harassment allegations that cut short his presidential bid in 2012. Cain has denied those allegations.

891,891,02-05-16 02:03,2016,5,2,Jason Del Rey,Amazon looks unstoppable. Here are five things that could slow it down.,"Amazon just pulled off its biggest quarterly profit in company history — for the second quarter in a row — and more people should be talking about it. Amazon is on its longest profitability streak in four years. And it’s doing so while its core retail business in North America is still growing more than twice as fast as the U.S. e-commerce industry on the whole. Translation: It is eating up a ton of market share and increasingly looking pretty much unstoppable along the way. Which leaves us with a question: Who or what can slow the company down? Here are five ideas. The $99 membership program is the single most important piece of Amazon today. Prime members shop more frequently and spend more than non-Prime members do, and also price-compare less. There are currently at least 46 million Prime members worldwide and possibly a lot more. Paid membership totals grew 51 percent last year, which is still fast. But, for the first time, Amazon has added a monthly payment option for Prime, hinting that it sees a need to reach new members in the U.S. not willing or able to pay $99 a year upfront. On last week’s earnings call, an Amazon executive called the upfront $99 fee “a hurdle for many people,” and said the monthly option is meant in part to appeal to new “demographic groups.” Still, growth is currently strong and Amazon has not yet launched the service in new markets like India and Mexico. Plus, it keeps adding value to what started out as just a shipping program: Music streaming, video streaming and same-day delivery options are some of the additional perks included in Prime memberships. Amazon only launched in India in 2013, but it is already challenging homegrown competitor Flipkart, which is nine years old, as the top destination for online shopping. Jeff Bezos has promised to invest billions into the company’s operations in India to make sure it succeeds in what will someday be one of the world’s biggest e-commerce markets. And it better. Amazon has underperformed in the only nation more populous than India: China. So if it wants to be a global power for decades to come, it has to get India right. It won’t be easy; federal regulations prohibit Amazon from storing and selling its own inventory in the country, meaning it has to operate much differently in India from how it does in the U.S. and several other countries. Amazon’s cloud computing unit will soon be a $10 billion business and has recorded operating profit margins that most analysts didn’t think were possible. But the unit has had to engage in pricing battles with competitors before and may face them again. Microsoft continues to invest big in cloud services; Google’s hire of VMware co-founder Diane Greene should re-energize the search giants’ efforts. While Prime is the most critical part of Amazon today, AWS may hold that spot in a distant tomorrow. Amazon has to continue to protect this future. The Amazon Echo has been the surprise consumer electronics hit of the last few years, but the real star is the Alexa AI-powered personal assistant behind it. That technology has made it clear that the idea of “voice search” is a big one, and Amazon is currently set up to be a key gatekeeper to that new world. Others will vie for that role, however. Apple, Google and Microsoft are all making big plays in the area, so Amazon will have its work cut out not to squander its early lead. One thread of negative news that Amazon can’t shake is that it is a grueling place to work. From stories about warehouse workers collapsing on the job and dying to office workers crying at their desks, the Amazon workplace does not give off warm and cuddly vibes. Eventually, you would think these narratives would have an effect on recruiting, but there are no obvious signs of that yet. You might also think shoppers would rebel at some point, too. And yet, Amazon grows in popularity among shoppers every year. Amazon customers may cringe when they read one of these articles, but few stop shopping there as a result. What would need to happen to change that? Apparently something much, much worse.

893,893,21-03-18 12:00,2018,3,21,Jennifer Billock,I Worry That Everything I Eat Is Going to Give Me Food Poisoning,"In my mid-twenties, I had a spectacular case of food poisoning. I was coming home late from work one night and picked up a salad at Wendy’s for dinner. In the midst of an otherwise delicious meal, I bit into an absolutely foul cherry tomato. I spent the next ten minutes spitting and rinsing my mouth of the rancid juice, with a glimmer of a thought about how I might get sick. The next day was a nightmare. By 10 am, I was curled into the fetal position on the bathroom floor at work, crying, and vomiting nonstop. It continued into the next morning, when I was finally able to stomach some crackers without getting violently ill. I can’t remember another time I was quite so sick—and both my body and my brain decided to remember it too. From that episode of food poisoning emerged a vast and severe anxiety of being sick after I eat. In my efforts to avoid it, I’ve become paranoid about every piece of food I see. I examine berries one by one to make sure they aren’t soft or dented. If they are, they’re thrown away. Bananas with brown spots will rot on the shelf because I’m afraid to eat them. If something tastes weird from a new ingredient, I instantly assume something in the dish was spoiled and I’m going to be sick.  I sometimes even trick myself into feeling ill the next day. I even count the hours between when I ate and when I feel like I’ll be alright—because I know it was 15 hours between that tomato and that illness. So if I make it past those 15, I should be good to go. I refuse to eat leftovers older than 48 hours. I’ve become so obsessed that it’s even cost me jobs. Once, I called in sick so often—because I thought I was about to be ill from food—that my employers decided I had a condition and let me go. I didn’t realize it was an issue. I thought I was just doing right by myself, aiming to stay on the good side of healthy consumption. My husband was the first to help me realize I might have an actual problem. We got closer when we started living together, and in his continual efforts to support me, he pointed out a few things: I’ve been throwing a lot away. I’m convinced I’m sick after every meal. I’m irrationally controlling over when leftovers get eaten. More from Tonic: Before this, I never thought about it much. I assumed it was normal behavior—the type I’d seen growing up with a dad who is often paranoid about food safety. It’s never been uncommon to hear, “Put that away or it’ll grow bacteria!” after just an hour of food being on the counter. “There is a clear correlation of increased diagnoses of anxiety, OCD, and eating disorders in children if a parent is showing symptoms,” says Edie Stark, a New York-based psychotherapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. “The environment we grow up [in?] absolutely has an effect on how we cope.” This is not to say my dad caused the problem—even if I had a bit of a head start from childhood. Things didn’t escalate to their current level until I’d moved out on my own, and they exploded into a full-blown phobia after that bout with the rotten cherry tomato.   Six months ago, I began therapy for my food issues, and I have an official diagnosis: control-based anxiety and borderline OCD specific to food quality. And I’m now working on how to navigate this. I’ve since learned that OCD tendencies can be inherited through genetics, which my own therapist says is likely the case with me, compounded by a few bad experiences that interacted with my anxiety about being unable to control when exactly food will spoil. We’re working on retraining my brain to be concerned at a rational level rather than assuming anything and everything is spoiled and will turn my life into the bathroom scene from Bridesmaids.  In one way, that means eating food that looks a bit off to me by consuming it in a different way, like throwing soft blueberries into a smoothie instead of discarding them. It also means pushing my personal boundaries of how long leftovers can last—I’m slowly moving from two days maximum to up to five days. And if I feel nauseous after eating, I need to sit and think about the actual reason I’m feeling sick instead of pinning it on food poisoning right away. Maybe I ate too much? Maybe the combination of foods just didn’t go well together? Maybe I didn’t eat  enough? It’s a lot of introspection and a healthy dose of going outside my comfort zone, and it appears to be working so far. It’s also an anxiety-producing nightmare; I have to force myself to do these things because my body physically tries to resist. But last week I ate something turned a funny orange color by an unusual spice, and I was totally fine. Before, I wouldn’t have eaten at all. “So if you have to wash your hands and your utensils before eating and have to eat off of a certain plate with only meals that came from McDonalds, we would start by stopping you from washing your hands right before eating,” she says. “Maybe we’d start with you washing them three minutes before eating. Or five. Or ten. Once fears subside, we’d move up the hierarchy to something else scary.” She adds that while it may sound terrifying, and it is anxiety provoking, it’s controlled to prevent anxiety from spiraling out of control. “We’d never actually poison you...and you  should be afraid of people who would be willing to poison you. The goal is to relegate the fear to normal proportions.” But even though I know my diagnosis now, and I’m undergoing treatment, the guilt I feel at the hands of this problem is nearly insurmountable. So many people in the world are starving and here I am, throwing out an ugly strawberry because I feel like it looked at me wrong. It’s the definition of privilege. I spend more than I should on groceries because it’s okay for me to just toss away something with a dent. Every ounce of me is screaming, “JUST EAT IT. People are broke. People are hungry. You aren’t. What’s your problem?!” But my brain tells me to throw everything out. It makes me so angry with myself. Fitzpatrick notes that even though I’m feeling this guilt, it’s important to remind myself that a mental illness is causing my suffering—it’s not me being fussy or spoiled. “This isn’t simply, ‘Oooh, that looks like a wonky mushroom, I’ll push it to the side,’” she says, “or ‘I’ll throw out the milk since it smells a little off,’ but is really like a five alarm fire going off under what are really everyday, necessary situations.” I do try to mitigate the guilt and self-hate in a few different ways. It starts at home; if I know my husband or someone in my family will eat whatever I don’t want, I pass it on to them. With my husband and brothers, it’s easiest. I just tell them I won’t eat something and to take it if they want it. With my parents, it’s a bit more complicated. I haven’t figured out why it’s harder for me to share my diagnosis or stress with them. But it seems like our homes are a never-ending revolving door of Tupperware. I bring food over and quietly leave it in their fridge in hopes that someone will eat it. If they do, I get the washed container back the next time I’m there. Nothing said when I drop it off, nothing asked when I get the Tupperware back. Outside my family, I try to compensate for my problems with food-focused charity work. If I’m checking out at a store and am prompted to donate a buck or two to starving children (or even pets), I always say yes. I feel like it’s the least I can do, since in my mind, I’m part of the problem. But, inevitably, I’m always left with the same inner conflict. I’m helping these charities out of a feeling of both disgust for myself and an attempt to make myself feel better. Does it still count as altruistic if it’s self-serving? And that brings on the guilt all over again.  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of Tonic delivered to your inbox weekly.

895,895,18-09-17 15:59,2017,9,18,Tanza Loudenback,How to use Sallie Krawcheck's Ellevest investing platform for women," Investing — when done right — is one of the best ways to make your money work for you, and it's critical for retiring comfortably. But the uncertainty and risk that comes with the markets is very often a major deterrent, especially for women, who invest at a much lower rate than men in the US. To combat this, former Wall Street executive Sallie Krawcheck launched Ellevest in 2016, a digital investing platform that puts female investors' money in low-cost ETFs based on a pick-and-choose set of goals, like starting a business, buying a home, having children, and retiring comfortably. This week, the startup announced a new $34.6 million round of funding, led by Rethink Impact, the largest US venture capital impact fund with a gender focus. Jenny Abramson, the VC firm's founder and managing partner, will join Ellevest's board. Tennis superstar Venus Williams, who is a champion of equal pay and opportunity for women both on and off the court, was among Ellevest's first investors. Women tend to be less concerned with beating the market — the focus of much of the modern investment industry — and more interested in assuring that their money won't disappear completely, according to Sallie Krawcheck, who is also the founder of Ellevate, a global network for professional women. Just 28% of women are willing to take on high risk to get a good return on their investment, compared to 45% of men, according to a 2015 report by BlackRock. Beyond helping women prioritize financial goals, Ellevest takes into account the established facts of how women's financial experiences differ from men's: longer lifespans, different salary arcs, and the possibility of extended time off from work. This specificity alone differentiates the platform from an emerging crop of startup robo-advisors, including Betterment and Wealthfront. Business Insider took a test drive of Ellevest's new software. Below, check out the simple (and surprisingly fun) process of setting up an account and creating an investment plan via Ellevest's website (the platform is currently available on mobile devices, but not yet in the app store). (Note: Business Insider used a hypothetical situation and figures for this demonstration.)

There are 3 things to understand about investing if you want to make money in the stock market",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-sallie-krawchecks-ellevest-investing-platform-for-women-2017-1,,Business Insider
896,896,15-06-19 00:00,2019,6,15,Gregory Volk,Ragnar Kjartansson’s Panorama of Love and Death,"The artist’s Death Is Elsewhere conveys an understanding that humans — relatively recent additions to a 4.5-billion-year-old planet — will come and go. The planet will remain. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson’s nine-channel video installation The Visitors (2012), drew throngs of rapt viewers during its extended run at Luhring Augustine Gallery in 2013. Many viewers took in the entire 64 minutes of the work; that’s most unusual for such a lengthy video. Quite a number (I was one of them) did so repeatedly. I visited five times, and extolled the work in an Art in America review. After my text was written and sent, I visited again. I took one step into the gallery and burst into tears. That was surprising. I’ve since learned that something similar happened with very many others. The Visitors is, to put things simply, one of the best and most moving contemporary artworks that I’ve encountered anywhere, at any time, in any medium. This is art that really, really matters. It can make you feel at once joyful and mournful and leave you shaken and changed. Now Kjartansson’s new seven-channel, 77-minute long video installation Death Is Elsewhere (2019) is having its world premiere at the Metropolitan Museum, as part of the Met’s escalating focus on contemporary art. While there are some similarities with The Visitors — notably, musician friends performing the same song in a lengthy video shot in one take — this new work is not at all a sequel. It is set in a very different location, namely Iceland, and has different themes. For me, this is one of the most compelling, do-not-miss-it artworks in New York of the season. In the court of the Met’s Robert Lehman Wing, seven large video screens are arranged in a circle with gaps between them. You can hear the work from afar, and you are lured by its music. (Before he became an art star, Kjartansson was the front man in the Icelandic electro-pop, post-punk band Trabant, which makes his deep engagement with music and musicians a natural fit.) The video features two sets of identical twins: Kristín Anna and Gyða Valtýsdóttir, both founding members of the seminal, atmospheric Icelandic band múm, and both riveting performers and singers in The Visitors (Gyða on cello, the ethereal Kristín Anna on accordion and acoustic guitar) and Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the renowned alt-rock band The National. The Dessner twins have collaborated with Kjartansson before. In his A Lot of Sorrow (2013-14), a concert at MoMA PS1 that was later turned into a video, The National played their tremendous song “Sorrow” over and over, for six hours in a row, 108 times in total. Sorrow was pervasive. It was in the honey; it was in the milk (if you know the song). So too were joy and exhilaration. Death Is Elsewhere was shot at 2am in South Iceland around the time of the summer solstice. It’s set on a grassy field, adjacent to a looming lava escarpment. Kristín Anna has paired off with Bryce, and Gyða with Aaron, slowly parading in a circle, singing in absolutely beautiful voices as the men strum acoustic guitars. With the two couples on opposite sides of the circle (and on opposite sides of the installation), Kjartansson films them as a slow, minimalist carousel far out in nature, going around and around, not getting anywhere in particular. Seven video cameras, all facing outward, were used to create, in effect, a panoramic view. Each camera was accompanied by three microphones, capturing the sound as it traveled. It’s hypnotic to watch them move from screen to screen: troubadours on the loose, minstrel poets wandering through the landscape, couples in love strolling through a meadow. The two couples become mirror images of each other; that they are two sets of identical twins makes things even more mirrored. The repetitive song, essentially a love song (although it has a dire refrain) with lyrics culled from several sources, including Alexander Dumbadze’s book Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere (2013), which tells the story an artist lost at sea, is entrancing. It seems timeless or unstuck in time, a contemporary song that could be from, say, 600 years ago, and it insinuates itself deeply into your psyche. You may find yourself singing and humming it for hours and days after. Here is an excerpt: In the dark In the dark My love My love By the stream By the stream My love My love Death is elsewhere Very effective is how the seven screens function as landscape “paintings” — moving, sonic paintings sans paint. The landscape displayed on each screen is stark yet lush, with the dark volcanic mountain, thick, swaying grass, and an eventful, cloudy sky glowing orange and yellow on the horizon. The images recall Dutch and Flemish 17th-century paintings, and in a happy coincidence Dutch painter Jacob van Ruisdael’s “Wheat Field” (ca. 1670), showing a flat, tawny and soft green landscape, is nearby, in the Met’s exhibition In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at the Met. Kjartansson’s video images also recall various 19th-century Romantic paintings, for instance by John Constable and Caspar David Friedrich. There are, however, no 17th-century Icelandic landscape paintings, and no 19th-century Icelandic Romantic paintings either. The country was too poor and remote, and too hobbled by Danish colonial rule and oppression, to develop its own visual art. Now, centuries later, using video, Kjartansson has slyly insinuated Iceland into the history of painting; he’s made 21st-century, new media, Icelandic versions that evoke famous art historical genres. And Iceland is at the core of this work. The landscape frames the walking singers; their elemental song — with its lyrics evoking the wind, and the dark, and the stream, and sleep — responds to the elemental surroundings. But that’s when things get surprising. Judging by the sky and the light, you may well think that these singing couples are ambling about at dusk or just a bit after dawn. Actually, they are walking in the middle of the night, in Iceland’s extreme summer conditions when it never gets dark. That looming, dark, and powerful lava escarpment in the video is quintessentially Icelandic, as anyone who has been to this part of the country readily knows. It is actually the remnant of the Laki volcanic fissure eruption of 1783-84 that destroyed nearby villages, contaminated the soil far and wide, and decimated crops, leading to a famine that eventually killed 25 percent of Iceland’s human population and more than 50 percent of its livestock. That eruption also wreaked havoc elsewhere, as far away as Syria and the Sahara, spreading poisonous haze and drastically affecting the global climate. Thousands died in England. There was famine in France, which led to social and political upheaval; it is likely that the eruption in Iceland was at least partly responsible for the French Revolution. The “death is elsewhere” refrain in the song suddenly assumes dramatic historical connotations. Kjartansson’s work is also especially relevant right now, given climate change and environmental mayhem. Death Is Elsewhere, like many of Kjartansson’s works, is frankly romantic and emotional, but also ironic and quite comical. These thoughtful, sensitive couples in their lovely Icelandic landscape are taking an absurd walk in a small, circumscribed circle, and doing so for a very long time. They are also frolicking at the epicenter of what was once a whopping ecological disaster, one which not only could, but at some point will, happen again. It is best to absorb the video for its whole duration, despite its length; surrender to the flow and let it work its slow magic. As the singing couples move around and around, you notice ever-changing details: the distinctive movements and gestures of the performers, the emotions that play over their faces; the complex, unscripted and unspoken, communication occurring between them, registered by touches and gazes, glances and smiles; the slight alterations of the song over time, as the performers change their intonations and emphasis. This is all mesmerizing. At the end of the video there is a breathtaking moment. All four singers just disappear, as if they have faded into the ether, dissolved into the vastness of the world and time. In their startling absence you hear the wind and the rustling grass, and you see the grass swaying. You see and absorb the landscape, minus humans. You are alone with Iceland, or rather with a video of it. We are left with the understanding that humans — relatively recent additions to a 4.5-billion-year-old planet — will come and go; the planet will remain. Then the singers reappear and their song commences and the cycle renews: life into death and death into life, in humankind and in nature. While working on Death Is Elsewhere, and no doubt many other projects as well, the much-in-demand Kjartansson was also developing his Reykjavik-based record label with the hilarious title Bel-Air Glamour Records — hilarious because for most of its 1,100-plus-year history, the remote, rugged, often poverty-stricken, staggeringly beautiful country of Iceland had nothing whatsoever to do with glamour. This record label seems to be not at all a normal one, as you divine here. While Bel-Air Glamour has released work by the musical genius Kjartan Sveinsson (formerly a member of the Icelandic mega-band Sigur Rós, and a performer, on piano, bass, and vocals in The Visitors) and by Kjartansson himself, a driving purpose behind the label, as Kjartansson revealed to me in an email, was to produce the first solo album with instruments and vocals by one of the twins in Death Is Elsewhere, Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir (previously Bel-Air released her experimental a cappella album Howl).  That album, I Must Be the Devil, is out now. It is thrilling and transportive and includes songs from 2005 to 2017 — private reflections, really — involving crisis, hope, whimsy, desolation, acceptance, and joy (among other emotions) in response to a life that can be messy and turbulent but also full of grace. But first, I have a confession: I am not a music critic and there are many, including many Hyperallergic readers, who are much more versed in contemporary music than I am. So I will write not as an expert but as an avid listener, and really as an ardent fan. Ever since I first encountered Kristín Anna years ago when she played with múm, (going by the stage name Kría Brekkan) I have been enthralled by her total musicianship: her rugged-crystal, high-pitched voice, at times wispy and at times fierce, quickly moving from a whisper to a shriek; the delightful, sometimes tumultuous sounds of her instrumentation; the potent (yet often mysterious) emotions that she ushers not just into her songs, but into a single word in the song, and oftentimes a single note. For me, Kristín Anna has long been not entertainment, but nutrition. I go to her music (and I do this a lot) for strange wisdom. This is a brilliant, soulful artist bringing complex life into complex music and frankly I am grateful. The nine songs on the album are piano-based ballads fleshed out by an all-star, mostly Icelandic cast: Gyða Valtýsdóttir on cello; Kjartan Sveinsson on bass and other instruments, including glockenspiel and vibraphone; María Huld Markan Sigfúsdóttir, Hildur Ársælsdóttir, and Edda Rún Ólafsdóttir (all three from the wonderful band amiina) on violin and viola; acclaimed composer Guðmundur Steinn Gunnarsson on guitar. Enormous talent is operating here. The songs (in English) are confessional and intimate, but strangely large, almost mythic. You sense that they arose from deeply felt experiences of longing and loss, homesickness, wounded friendship, love, and alienation. Nature is a constant: ocean waves and forest trees, the moon and wind, the sky and lightning. Each song doesn’t really tell a story, but instead hints at one obliquely, often through inventive language (“sky above a palace joy/we beneath in un-ballast loving”). “Forever Love” is an impassioned plea for a lasting love, but also, one suspects, an ironic acknowledgement that it often doesn’t. Together with director Allan Sigurðsson, Kjartansson made the music video, which alternates between Kristín Anna at home, in some shots visibly pregnant, and also outdoors, torching a rickety construction in a stunning setting next to a glacial river. “Girl,” the last song on the album, an amazing nine-minute meditation on a fractured friendship, encapsulates a world of feeling: passion, regret, sadness, curiosity, respect. The entire album is polished and exquisite but also charged through and through with raw, honest feeling. The music can be orchestral and full, or airy and ambient, frequently in the same song. It is often melancholic, but seeded with buoyant passages and, at times, ecstatic flourishes. Kristín Anna’s piano is intoxicating. It’s as if she’s using it to summon invisible spirits of the earth and air while exploring the intricate nuances of her thoughts and emotions. And then there is her remarkable voice, so fresh and distinctive, but also somehow ancient, as if from a thousand years ago. Ragnar Kjartansson’s exhibition at the Met opened on a Thursday. On the following Sunday at The Kitchen, there was a concert by Kristín Anna on piano and vocals, accompanied by her sister Gyða on cello; the concert celebrated the release of I Must Be the Devil, which was performed in full. Kjartansson was the hilarious MC and opening act, on vocals and acoustic guitar. To counteract, as he told the audience, the devil in the title of Kristín Anna’s album, he sang three Christian country songs by the Louvin Brothers, Charlie and Ira, including “The Christian Life,” pointing out that the Christianity-promoting Ira was a hard drinking, brawling, despicable person prone to vicious bar fights and domestic abuse. Kjartansson also disclosed that performing in The Kitchen had been his impossible dream back in art school in Reykjavik years ago. Now that he was in The Kitchen, he wanted to take full advantage of the opportunity, and so performed a ludicrous, yet again hilarious, piece of body art by stripping off his shirt and rhythmically flapping his slightly flabby male breasts. The audience went nuts. Then the two sisters came on stage, in their glittering gold gowns. It’s great to hear Kristín Anna’s songs on the album, but a different matter altogether to experience them live. She doesn’t just sing her songs, she lives them. She doesn’t just sing with her voice but with her whole body, from her larynx to her sinews, veins, and nerves, and especially from her heart. Each song felt like a voyage filled with cascading, layered emotions. Each was utterly transfixing. It’s easy to see the connection between Kjartansson and Kristín Anna. For all his irony and antics, Kjartansson uncommonly and unabashedly deals in core human matters, in “heartly matters,” which is the title of one of Kristín Anna’s songs. Among these are love, friendship, sorrow, hopefulness, pain, joy, death, and our relationship with nature and the cosmos. Kristín Anna does too, in droves; it’s what helps make her music so meaningful and exceptional. Here are the lovely opening lines to the first song on her album, also the opening lines to what was a magical concert: the oceanwave rocks my kneeshells that is why i am laughing i do find leaving sad…. And you can listen to the song here. Ragnar Kjartansson: Death Is Elsewhere continues at the Metropolitan Museum (1000 5th Ave, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through September 2.

897,897,16-02-19 00:00,2019,2,16,,China-U.S. trade talks 'making a final sprint': state media,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Saturday expressed cautious optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, a day after President Xi Jinping said a week of discussions had produced “step-by-step” progress.  Xi made the comments at a meeting on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing, after a week of senior- and deputy-level talks.  The People’s Daily, the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary that Xi’s meeting with U.S. negotiators had affirmed progress made in previous talks and “injected new impetus into the next stage of the development of Sino-U.S. trade relations.”  The talks “have made important progress” for the next round of negotiations in Washington next week, the paper said in its domestic edition.  “It is hoped that the two sides will maintain the good momentum of the current consultations and strive to reach an agreement within the set time limit,” it said.  U.S. duties on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if there is no deal by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights.  In its overseas edition, the People’s Daily said “zero-sum thinking and games where you lose and I win can only create losses for both. Only on a basis of mutual respect and equal treatment, through dialogue and consultation, can we find a solution acceptable to both sides.”  An English-language editorial in the Global Times, which is published by the People’s Daily, said news that China had consulted on the text of a memorandum of understanding “shows the two sides have made unprecedented progress.”  “The MOU and next week’s talks both show that the seemingly endless China-U.S. trade negotiations, like a marathon, are making a final sprint,” it said.  The newspapers cautioned that any agreement would have to be in the interests of both the United States and China.  “There are still obstacles to be overcome, and no one should underestimate how daunting a task the two sides face trying to resolve all the differences that have long existed between them in one clean sweep,” the official English-language China Daily said in an editorial.

899,899,13-05-19 00:00,2019,5,13,,Trump says U.S. farmers to get $15 billion in aid amid China trade war,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration was planning to provide about $15 billion in aid to help U.S. farmers whose products may be targeted with tariffs by China in a deepening trade war.  “We’re going to take the highest year, the biggest purchase that China has ever made with our farmers, which is about $15 billion, and do something reciprocal to our farmers so our farmers can do well,” Trump told reporters at the White House.  He did not provide more details on what kind of an aid package it would be.  American farmers, a key constituency of Trump, have been among the hardest hit in the trade war. Soybeans are the most valuable U.S. farm export, and shipments to China dropped to a 16-year low in 2018. Sales of U.S. soybeans elsewhere failed to make up for the loss. U.S. soybean futures fell to their lowest in a decade on Monday.   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Friday that Trump had asked him to create a plan to help American farmers cope with the heavy impact of the U.S.-China trade war on agriculture.  A new aid program would be the second round of assistance for farmers, after the Department of Agriculture’s $12 billion plan last year to compensate for lower prices for farm goods and lost sales stemming from trade disputes with China and other nations.  “Out of the billions of dollars that we’re taking (in on tariffs on Chinese imports), a small portion of that will be going to our farmers, because China will be retaliating, probably to a certain extent, against our farmers,” Trump said.  The tariffs are not paid by the Chinese government or by firms located in China. They are paid by importers of Chinese goods, usually American companies or the U.S.-registered units of foreign companies.  On Monday, China said it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas, striking back in its trade war with Washington after Trump warned it not to.  Last year, Beijing imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural goods, including soybeans, grain sorghum and pork as retribution for U.S. levies.  While farmers have largely remained supportive of Trump, many have called for an imminent end to the trade dispute, which propelled farm debt to the highest levels in decades and worsened credit conditions for the rural economy.   Trump’s pledge on Friday to buy American farm products that China normally imports and distribute them to poor countries drew criticism from Canada.  “Dumping products in developing countries is not the way we do things,” Canadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau told reporters on a conference call from the G20 meeting in Japan, adding such efforts required multilateral coordination.  “It seems easy, but it is complicated to do it the right way,” Bibeau said. “Obviously, it may create some distortion in the market and this is what we want to avoid.”  Reporting by Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Writing by Tim Ahmann and Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-agriculture/trump-says-u-s-farmers-to-get-15-billion-in-aid-amid-china-trade-war-idUSKCN1SJ22Z,Business News,Reuters
900,900,30-03-18 16:00,2018,3,30,Michael Richards,This Is What It's Like to be Diagnosed With Autism as an Adult,"“He is wired differently to you and me, this child of mine. He doesn’t like loud noises, or dark spaces, or strangers touching his head”. These are the first lines from a poem a mother penned about her son 11-year-old son who has Asperger’s syndrome. Sophie Billington goes on to explain how her son Tristan’s brain works differently: “He can see in an instant the pattern, the layout, the solution to a puzzle”, but that “the world judges” and “sees only the outbursts and over-reactions."" It seems the poem struck a chord, going viral after being posted on Facebook. Although autism is predominantly diagnosed in childhood, increasing numbers of adults are finding out that they too have autism. This issue, of later life diagnosis, was brought to light recently after nature photographer and TV presenter, Chris Packham, went public with his experiences. About one percent of the adult population has been diagnosed as on the autism spectrum, with more people diagnosed with autism than ever before. And yet, generally, the focus on who has autism is still mostly on infants, children and young adults. This is despite the fact that autism can be defined as a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by differences in social communication and interaction with people and wider society, making it very much a label for people of all ages. More from Tonic: There are currently about 3.5 million Americans and 700,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with autism in some form or another. But of course, there may well be many more who meet the criteria of autism but have not been diagnosed. For these people, they will not have received the care, benefits, support or advice that people with a diagnosis are given. Instead, the judgements made about their behavior may well have led to marginalization, anxiety and insecurity and self-doubt about who they are and how they fit into society. Mental illness can also be more common for people on the autism spectrum, with higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression. These issues may well have developed from experiences of bullying, at home or the workplace, and from being seen as “being a bit odd”. Then there is also the issue that since 2013, definitions of autism have changed. Now, Asperger’s Syndrome—one of several previously separate sub-types of autism—is no longer diagnosed separately, but amalgamated into “Autism Spectrum Disorders."" This may make some adults feel alienated and unsure about what their diagnosis actually means, as well as what support they may receive. For some adults who are diagnosed later in life, it is likely they have already found ways to cope and be resilient in the face of discrimination and stereotyping. But this is not always the case. Some adults with autism still face daily and lifelong battles to cope in their day-to-day lives. They may also find things like getting a job, meeting new people and having personal relationships really difficult. The UK-based NHS website highlights that it might be a positive step to be diagnosed with autism as an adult—presumably because you may receive support, care, and benefits. To what extent a person will actually receive this additional help is another issue. And given the increasing rates with which children and young people are being diagnosed with autism, it is likely that adults who are diagnosed later on, are going to struggle to access the support they really need. Even when adults do get referred for an assessment for autism they are likely to face lengthy waits and processes—with clinical language being used that can be misunderstood. It can also tend to focus on the deficit rather than the skills of autism, such as creativity, expertise and talents. In this way, then, people who come to an autism diagnosis later in life are likely to continue to experience mental health issues, alongside the stigma, prejudice and discrimination associated with people with learning disabilities. There are of course many different viewpoints to understanding autism, whether they be from a purely medical perspective, or from a social perspective that takes into account cultural and political factors. But rather than seeing autism just as a deficit or something that is “not normal” we need to see it as a way to think about how different people are. Because after all, it is through difference that we learn more, achieve more, and add more substance to day-to-day life in society.

901,901,20-09-17 03:35,2017,9,20,Dylan Scott,Jimmy Kimmel: new Obamacare repeal bill flunks the Jimmy Kimmel Test,"Jimmy Kimmel became an unlikely figure in the Republican health care debate a few months ago when he reached an accord of sorts with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), setting standards that any bill to repeal and replace Obamacare should meet. On Tuesday, Kimmel slammed Cassidy, the author of the GOP’s last-ditch plan to overhaul US health care, for failing to meet those standards in his own legislation. “This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face,” Kimmel said in his opening monologue, which was posted online shortly before his show aired. Back in May, Kimmel interviewed Cassidy about the GOP’s health care plans after the late-night host had been outspoken about his newborn son’s open-heart surgery. He and Cassidy discussed what became called the “Jimmy Kimmel test.” Cassidy has used that term repeatedly throughout the past few months of the health care debate. Kimmel defined it like this: “No family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.” The host ticked through related requirements that he said Cassidy had set for his own health care plan: “The new bill does none of those things,” Kimmel said on Tuesday night. “Not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test, he failed the Bill Cassidy test.” “He wasn’t very honest,” the host said to open his monologue. “It seemed like he was being honest. He got a lot of credit and attention for coming off like a rare reasonable voice in the Republican Party when it came to health care.” The bill produced by Cassidy and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), which Republican leaders are trying to build support for and put on the Senate floor next week, is widely expected to result in fewer people having health coverage. Insurers would also be permitted, if individual states choose to allow it, to charge people higher premiums based on their medical history, as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported. The net effect on premiums is not expected to be known before the Senate would vote, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it would not have enough time to fully analyze the bill. But some people could see higher premiums, if prices based on health status are once again allowed. Finally, by allowing states to waive Obamacare’s rules for which essential health benefits insurance plans must cover, annual or lifetime limits could be reintroduced for services that states decide are not mandatory “With this [bill], your child with a preexisting condition will get the care he needs, if and only if his father is Jimmy Kimmel,” Kimmel said Tuesday. “Otherwise you might be screwed.” Asked for a response to Kimmel’s comments, Cassidy focused on the looming September 30 deadline for Senate Republicans to pass a health care bill. ""We have a September 30 deadline on our promise. Let’s finish the job,” he said in a statement provided by his office. “We must because there is a mother and father whose child will have insurance because of Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson. There is someone whose pre-existing condition will be addressed because of GCHJ.” “I dedicated my medical career to care for such as these,” Cassidy said. “This is why GCHJ must pass.""",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16337466/jimmy-kimmel-test-bill-cassidy-graham,,Vox

Abu Ahmed, a local salt farmer who was also at the protest was shot in the leg. ""People from all walks of life were at the rally protesting the coal-fired power plants,"" he said. ""As we approached the school, police opened fire without any provocation. They fired gunshots like they were trying to kill birds."" Ali Nabi is a former member of Gandamara Union Council, the smallest rural administrative and local government units in Bangladesh. He says the police fired as many as 700 rounds. Several witnesses said that the police were accompanied by armed ""goons"" working for a Chittagong business tycoon who has bought up land where the power plants are proposed to be built. Police claim 11 officers were injured by the protestors and told AFP they have filed cases against around 3,200 people for vandalism and assault. Related: Coal and Solar Energy Are Neck-and-Neck in the Developing World The coal plants will produce 1,224 megawatts of electricity and are financed by Chinese firms SEPCOIII Electric Power and HTG, which will pick up $1.75 billion of the plants' estimated cost of $2.4 billion. The plants are supposed to ease the frequent power cuts of the industrial city of Chittagong, but activists who oppose the project say it will also force the eviction of several thousand people and require demolition of temples and schools. Shaiful Huq of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources and Ports said several of the group's student activists helped to organize the protest. ""Four of our students got hurt, two of them are seriously injured with bullet wounds,"" Huq said. ""This has not stopped them. People are trying to reorganize right now in the affected villages and there is no way they will allow any company to come in and do this."" Bangladesh is investing heavily in large-scale energy projects. In December, the country signed a deal with Russia to build two nuclear power plants with a combined capacity of 2,400 megawatts — an investment totaling $12.65 billion. The first plant is expected to begin operating by 2022 and the second a year later. The country currently produces a total of only 8,000 megawatts of electricity and the per capita power consumption averages about 300 kilowatt hours (kWh), compared to 13,000 kWh in the United States. Around 40 percent of the population is without any access to electricity, according to the Ministry of Power. Natural gas generates two-thirds of today's power, but as demand is growing fast the government is aiming to reach 36,000 megawatts by 2030 through power plant construction. A majority of that electricity will be coal-fired. And it's the coal projects that are attracting most of the public outrage. Related: People in Bangladesh Are Cleaning Up A Huge Oil Spill With Their Bare Hands The violence in Gandamara came less than a month after environmental organizations led a 200-mile march from Dhaka to the Sundarbans, the world's biggest mangrove forest, in protest of the government's plans to build two coal-power plants just 14 kilometers from the UNESCO World Heritage-listed forest. Those power plants will generate a combined output of 1,885 MW. The Sundarbans is an important habitat for endangered species like the Bengal tigers and the only two remaining freshwater dolphin species in Asia: the Irrawaddy river dolphin and the Ganges river dolphin. A planned coal mine in northern Bangladesh, in Phulbari, has been on hold for eight years. According to local activists, villagers opposed to the project have been continuously harassed by police. At a 2008 rally in Phulbari, three protestors were killed and around 200 injured protesting against the mine which would require the eviction of over 50 villages in the area. In January 2015, the government fast-tracked the approval of another coal-power plant in Matabari, just south of Gandamara. These new power plants and the increased access to electricity are important steps on Bangladesh's path toward development. However, as one of the nations in the world most vulnerable to climate change, environmental organizations fear the rush to boost electricity through the use of fossil fuels could be devastating. ""These projects will deteriorate the whole situation"", says Shaiful Huq. ""We need electricity, but not at the cost of our important wild natural heritage or our precious coastal areas. The government should pursue more sustainable alternatives for meeting the energy needs of this country."" Activists and residents in Gandamara are gearing up for more protests.

905,905,30-06-18 00:00,2018,6,30,,U.S. government says it will detain migrant children with parents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said in a court filing on Friday that it has the right to detain children and parents caught crossing the U.S. border illegally for the duration of their immigration proceedings.  A 1997 court settlement known as the Flores agreement has generally been interpreted to require the Department of Homeland Security to release illegal immigrant children from custody after 20 days.  But Justice Department lawyers said in the filing in U.S. District Court in California on Friday that they now have no choice but to hold children for as long as it takes to resolve their immigration cases, because of a preliminary injunction issued on Tuesday in a separate immigration case.   That case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in San Diego, challenged the recent government policy of separating families in order to detain parents for as long as necessary under President Donald Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policy.   Since that policy was implemented in May, families have been routinely separated after apprehension. Some 2,000 separated children are currently under government care.  An executive order issued by Trump this month reversed the policy, and the subsequent injunction in San Diego ordered the government to immediately stop separating parents and children and said families must be reunited in 30 days or less.  To comply with the injunction, the government said Friday it “will not separate families but detain families together during the pendency of immigration proceedings.” Cases can sometimes take months or years to resolve.  Under previous administrations, parents and children were often released to pursue immigration claims at liberty in the United States. Trump has decried that so-called catch-and-release policy, and vowed to detain immigration violators.

907,907,24-02-19 17:30,2019,2,24,Cheryl Wischhover,The Oscars red carpet is one big makeup ad,"Lady Gaga famously wore no makeup to her audition for A Star Is Born, but you can safely guess that she’ll be wearing plenty of it to the Oscars. Gaga is nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her turn in the film, and she and her longtime makeup artist Sarah Tanno love a statement look. Another safe bet will be that the makeup will be come from Marc Jacobs Beauty — or at least the products that you hear about. Tanno is a “Marc Jacobs Beauty Global Artistry Ambassador.” This means that the brand pays her to use and publicize its products. (There are several other high profile makeup artists who hold this title as well, including Adele’s makeup artist, Michael Ashton.) She gives interviews with detailed product breakdowns and tags the brand frequently on her Instagram, where she has 195,000 followers. She’s done this consistently on her feed all during awards season. Ultimately, the red carpet is an ad — for the studios, for the celebrities, for the “who are you wearing” gowns that, sorry, you’ll probably never wear, and, yep, for the foundation and eyeshadow you might actually splurge on. As Connie Wang pointed out at Refinery29, the red carpet is “a money-making marketing event that benefits the fashion industry and the celebrities that profit from the whole spectacle.” Gorgeous @ladygaga attends @sagawards in @dior And @tiffanyandco Jewelry. Styled by @sandraamador.xx & @tomeerebout Beautiful hair by @fredericaspiras Biba is a brave and intigent soul made from the purest of traits. That was the inspiration for our chic Biba glam moment #sagawards I wanted the texture to look like a glaze on the eyes. I used @marcjacobsbeauty Flamboyant Eye-Conic eyeshadow palette to achieve this. Eleganza shade all over the lids and swept under the outer corner of eyes. A touch of loose gold glitter was placed in center and corner of eyes to tie into the Tiffany’s jewelry. I next used Blaquer Highliner Gel Crayon to tight line and blend out to a smoked liner. Finished with Velvet Noir Mascara to top and bottom lashes. I used a pump of Dew Drops in “Dew You?” mixes in with Shameless foundation to get that glossy skin look. Set with Finish Line coconut setting powder. Omega bronzer to add warmth around the face and cheekbones. To get the perfect vampy pout I started by lining the lips with (P)outliner in Currant Mood heavily then blended Blow lipstick into it and a pop of Dashing in the center to brighten. #sarahtannomakeup #marcjacobsbeauty #marcfam #biba #darklips #vamp #ladygaga A post shared by Sarah Nicole Tanno (@sarahtannomakeup) on Jan 27, 2019 at 4:45pm PST In Hollywood, it’s an open secret that celebrities get paid a lot of money to wear certain fashion or jewelry brands and that stylists get paid to put them on their clients. Ditto beauty, even though you’ll never hear Giuliana Rancic ask, “What eyeshadow is that?” (We came close to this reality for nail polish with the short-lived, much-maligned “Mani Cam.”) But thanks to “get the look” beauty breakdowns from People, InStyle, and Us Magazine, and behind-the-scenes Instagram stories from the artists documenting every brushstroke, brands that sell beauty products are getting plenty of attention. These lucrative deals raise difficult-to-parse questions about sponsored content and the need for Federal Trade Commission disclosures. But perhaps even more importantly, everyone involved — from the stars to the makeup artists to the brands — has a vested interest in maintaining the illusion that celebs appear on red carpets as exquisite, fully formed goddesses, without the taint of commercial gain. Celebrities have long been the benefactors of lucrative beauty contracts, but now more and more makeup and hair care companies are negotiating arrangements with the so-called “glam squads” behind the famous faces. Artists have had brand deals in the past, like makeup artist and author of the classic Making Faces, Kevyn Aucoin, who worked with Shiseido in the 1990s. But they are becoming more common and visible than ever thanks to Instagram and the rise of influencer culture. A brand ambassadorship is an opportunity for the pros behind the scenes to make extra income and earn some publicity for their artistry. And they’re not the only ones benefiting. Very few people involved in the deals are willing to talk frankly about this practice. I reached out to several agencies that represent makeup artists, celebrity branding agencies, brands (including Marc Jacobs Beauty), and publicists. Many either didn’t respond or declined to be interviewed. A few who did wanted to remain anonymous. One boutique agency that brokers celebrity brand deals wrote to me, “This isn’t anything we’d like to discuss.” After awards shows, you’ve probably seen “get the look” makeup and hair breakdowns on lifestyle sites and tabloids like US Weekly. The featured products get there in a variety of ways. Sometimes a product gets attention because a celebrity uses it and genuinely loves it. At the 2014 Oscars ceremony, during a bit in which host Ellen Degeneres went around collecting tips for a pizza delivery man, Lupita Nyong’o pulled a Clarins lip balm out of her purse and dropped it in Ellen’s hat. The moment went viral and, as per a giddy press release sent out by the brand, the lip balm nearly sold out across the country overnight. A month later, Clarins competitor Lancôme signed Nyong’o to a lucrative multi-year beauty contract, which she still has. Which brings us to the second kind of beauty brand endorsement, likely most familiar to consumers: the celebrity brand deal. When her makeup artist Nick Barose gives interviews about Nyong’o’s looks, he uses all Lancôme products because she’s their brand ambassador. It’s similar to when a celebrity signs a long-term deal with a fashion brand, like Jennifer Lawrence and Dior. You won’t see her on a red carpet in a non-Dior outfit or without a face full of Dior makeup.

Take Gal Gadot and her makeup artist Sabrina Bedrani. In an Allure story about 2018’s Oscars beauty looks, it notes that Bedrani used all Revlon products on Gadot. Not a surprise, because Gadot was named a Revlon beauty ambassador just a few months prior to the Oscars. But Bedrani is herself a Dior makeup ambassador; her client’s beauty deal (of course) preempts her own. The up-and-coming generation of makeup artists and hair stylists have amassed healthy social media followings in their own right, and brands know that they can be a good avenue to showcase product on celebrities without paying the celebs directly. Makeup artists and hair stylists are less expensive than stars, who can command seven figures or more for brand ambassadorships. “[Brands are] actually treating stylists and artists like influencers. We’re looking at the influencer behind the influencer being just as important nowadays. It’s not just about on-screen talent anymore,” says Stacy Jones, the CEO of Hollywood Branded, an entertainment marketing agency. And celebrities often know their glam squads are getting paid by brands. “Stylists and makeup artists often have a very close relationship with their [clients]. Most of the time it’s the celebrity going along and supporting that stylist.” As a result, more artist brand ambassador deals are being made, and brands are actively promoting the artists. According to a 2017 Marc Jacobs Beauty press release announcing the new artistry ambassadorships with Tanno and the others on the brand’s roster, “These artists will be leveraged across every platform where they will share their skill set with clients and media alike.” How the deals actually happen and how much money changes hands is pretty opaque. How much an artist gets paid depends on a variety of factors, according to Jones, including the size of the artist, the length of the deal, the star or stars involved, and agreements around the number and content of social media posts and press interviews. Plus, factor in the relative “importance” of whatever red carpet they’re working. The partnerships can be longer term, like Tanno’s, or one-time deals for a specific show. “[The rate] could start at $7,500 and go up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for these partnerships,” says Jones. One-time deals for red carpet events have been a time-honored tradition, occurring regularly ever since magazines and tabloids have covered event fashion. But they’ve increased in the past 10 years as the immediacy of digital media has allowed brands to communicate with readers and consumers quickly, often in real time. Jones calls this situation more “opportunistic” than strategic, noting that brands now want to develop stronger and longer-term relationships with artists, especially if they have an attractive roster of popular celebs. But the one-offs can be a lucrative side hustle. She said an artist working at a “good show” with multiple celebrities could pull in $25,000 from a brand, and that doesn’t count the fee the artist charges the celebrities for services. The lower rate would likely be for a smaller-scale red carpet event — think the People’s Choice Awards — which is consistent with what one industry source familiar with the process of brands “sponsoring a look” said. “We once paid a makeup artist $6,000. They then would give the look breakdown and do any corresponding interviews for it,” the industry source said. The “look” includes only products from the brand paying the artist. According to another industry source familiar with one-time deals, agencies that represent makeup artists and hair stylists start “shopping [them] around a few weeks before the awards.” In one email reviewed by Vox, an agency representative wrote to a brand representative soliciting sponsorship for an artist who would be working with an A-list actress and presenter for an upcoming awards ceremony. “Would love to work with you for the ‘get the look,’” the email read. This means that the artist would use all products from the sponsoring brand and be prepared to discuss them with media. During the event or the next morning, beauty editors will find dozens of emails from brands in their inboxes explaining exactly which products were used on which celebrities and offering interviews with artists and hair stylists. (I’ve received these emails in my past role as a digital beauty editor.) Oftentimes brand emails will already include quotes directly from artists. These become the perennially popular “get the look” stories. Readers genuinely want to know what celebs are wearing, meaning that sites get traffic and possibly affiliate revenue. Brands get awareness, sales, and the kind of glow that can only come from a celebrity. Celebrities get their faces splashed across the internet. “It’s to the benefit of the celebrity to get press, talking about their flawless makeup look. It all goes into the entire package and story and PR angle of a celebrity,” says Jones. The celebrities who end up with these products on their faces sometimes have input into these deals but may not be paid. “The [artist’s] agency usually won’t approach brands without them being okayed by the celebrity’s PR, in my experience, but it’s really between the brands and agency,” said one of the industry sources. This is consistent with a 2017 Business of Fashion report, which noted that often “the stylist is getting paid and the celebrity isn’t, especially with beauty deals.” Brands want the consumer to think that the celebrity loves a product because it was on their face. And it works. At the 2018 Grammy awards, Glossier teased a new product release that Beyonce’s makeup artist Sir John used on her at the Grammys. In an Instagram post after the show, the brand wrote, “Beyoncé wears ___ in ___ (coming soon).” Sir John said in a Glossier press release, “I was lucky enough to be one of the first people to try a new and exciting product from Glossier. Stay tuned to hear more but I LOVED using it on Bey all weekend.” Headlines like, “Beyoncé Loves This Millennial Favorite Makeup Brand” appeared online. Beyoncé wears ___ in ___ (coming soon)✨ , Boy Brow in Brown, Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream, and Perfecting Skin Tint in Dark + Deep ✨ @sirjohnofficial A post shared by Glossier (@glossier) on Jan 28, 2018 at 7:37pm PST A few weeks later at the Oscars, the product was revealed to be a new type of eyeshadow. Several actresses — all with different makeup artists — wore the eyeshadow to the Academy Awards. It wasn’t a coincidence that the makeup artists all stumbled on this wonderful shadow and decided to use it for the Oscars red carpet. As I reported at Racked at the time, Glossier savvily used the event to debut its new product; it was covered everywhere. And it’s not obvious (Glossier did not answer questions about the situation at the time) who — the artists, Beyoncé, the actresses, everyone — was paid. There are instances where makeup artists and celebrities will rave about products they really, truly love. But the existence of genuine, non-paid endorsements makes it that much harder to tell when one is paid. When you flip through Instagram or a slideshow on a website after a red carpet event, it’s not at all apparent. Publicists never explicitly write in press releases, “This artist was paid/sponsored by us.” The resulting stories rarely, if ever, mention the partnerships. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the government agency responsible for monitoring advertising. Its endorsement guidelines attempt to clarify how this should be done on social media when posting about products. In the fall of 2017 it sent warning letters to celebrities and influencers about properly disclosing “material connections” to brands. A material connection means that a brand is paying or giving free product to an artist or celebrity. It implies a business relationship. The second important part is whether viewers, followers, customers, or readers would expect there to be that connection, according to Amy Mudge, an attorney specializing in regulatory law at Washington, DC, firm BakerHostetler. If there’s a material connection that consumers wouldn’t expect to exist, it should be clearly disclosed. But does paid red carpet product use and the press releases I get count as advertising? “There is not a bright line answer here,” says Mudge. “If there is no disclosure, the brand would need to feel comfortable that the press release designed to elicit press would not be deemed advertising. The words used to convey a connection between the brand and the artist would need to be understood to the intended audience, beauty editors.” Mudge acknowledges that disclosure is tricky on a red carpet when celebs, say, name drop their gown’s designer. “You can’t pin a sign on the dress,” she says. Since specific makeup is rarely discussed in a red carpet interview, it’s most applicable when a brand or artist break down the products on their social media. Mudge says the brands have responsibility for ensuring compliance. “If the brand is paying someone to use their products, the brand should tell their endorsers, ‘You’ve got to include clear and conspicuous disclosure.’” While consumers are more savvy, brands and artists can’t assume that most award show viewers are so naturally cynical — or understand so much about the hush-hush world of red carpet monetization, or keep up with the many brand partnerships being announced — that disclosures aren’t necessary. The FTC guidelines allow for some ambiguity: not insisting on only words like “ad” and “sponsored,” and allowing phrases like “ambassador” and “partner” when used prominently next to the brand name. According to Mudge, “The FTC has broadened its worldview.” But Mudge says it’s not enough to put “X brand ambassador” only in an Instagram profile. “Posts are viral. People can come and look at a single post and might not look at an influencer’s entire body of work,” she explains. As Julie Zerbo wrote at The Fashion Law back in 2017, while discussing the disclosure ramifications of red carpet fashion sponsorships, “Would that group of people understand that [the stylist or celebrity] was compensated – either by way of cash or some other perk?...Probably not. Given the lack of uniformity, consumers do not have a set-in-stone rule, so to speak, to go on when viewing red carpet coverage or viewing subsequent coverage.’” The same goes for beauty. Mudge says, “People may understand that [someone] is a commercial makeup artist and this is her commercial feed and she is being paid. But ultimately, if the FTC came knocking, it’s going to be the brand’s and the influencer’s responsibility to demonstrate to the FTC, ‘Don’t worry about it, no one’s confused here, everyone understands that we’re all working together.’” Speaking of cynicism, this all assumes that the products that are being hyped are the ones that were actually used. One of the industry sources said, “They never actually use your product! Well, hopefully [they do], but usually a makeup artist uses what they were planning to anyway.” This lines up with behavior I sometimes witnessed backstage at fashion shows. A makeup brand would sponsor the show, but the artists would be using some products that weren’t from that brand. So, this awards season, if you see and admire your favorite actress wearing a beautiful lipstick, be wary. Brands pay a lot to get you to “get the look.” Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?

908,908,10-02-17 13:30,2017,2,10,Matthew Yglesias,Americans’ respect for police officers surged last year,"Over the past few years, Black Lives Matter activists have prompted an unprecedented level of media and political scrutiny on questions related to police misconduct. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign very openly sounded these themes — first to rally people of color to her standard in the primary campaign against Bernie Sanders, and then on an ongoing basis in her losing general election campaign — in a way that was strikingly different from her husband’s “tough on crime” politics. Under the circumstances, many people may not be aware that 2016 was also a year in which Gallup found a huge surge in pro-police sentiment among the mass public. Activists, of course, would never frame a movement for more rigorous oversight of misconduct as expressing a lack of respect for police. And there is no doubt a huge number of Americans who would both tell you that they have enormous respect for the police in their local community and also respect the concerns that have been raised about the conduct of some police officers. But the trend line here is striking and unmistakable — rising scrutiny of police departments happened alongside an impressive awakening of pro-police sentiment. And, strikingly, while the level of respect for police is higher among whites than non-whites, the change is visible across ethnic groups. Indeed, in percentage terms non-whites actually expressed a larger surge of respect for police officers. Combine this with the apparent rise in the rate of murder and violent crime (albeit still to levels that are lower than what we saw five or ten years ago) and it’s relatively easy to see why Donald Trump thinks emphasizing his disposition to support law enforcement officers is smart politics.",https://www.vox.com/2017/2/10/14563556/police-respect-poll,,Vox
909,909,03-05-19 15:30,2019,5,3,Gaby Del Valle,Styrofoam ban: Maine bans polystyrene ,"Maine just became the first state to ban Styrofoam food containers. The bill, which was signed into law on Tuesday and goes into effect in January 2021, prohibits convenience stores, restaurants, grocery stores, farm stands, and coffee shops from using containers made of polystyrene, which is more commonly referred to as Styrofoam. “Polystyrene cannot be recycled like a lot of other products, so while that cup of coffee may be finished, the Styrofoam cup it was in is not,” Maine Gov. Janet Mills told CNN affiliate WMTW in a statement. “In fact, it will be around for decades to come and eventually it will break down into particles, polluting our environment, hurting our wildlife, and even detrimentally impacting our economy.” Foam food containers made of polystyrene are among the 10 most commonly littered items in the US, and more than 256 million pieces of disposable Styrofoam products are used every year in Maine, according to the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Maine’s Styrofoam ban is part of a larger wave of cities and states trying to cut down on pollution — and possibly stave off the worst effects of climate change — by implementing regulations that affect consumers. California, Hawaii, and New York have all passed legislation banning single-use plastic bags, though New York’s law doesn’t go into effect until 2020. A number of American cities, including Boston and Chicago, have also banned single-use plastic bags, while others have begun charging consumers for them. Plastic straw bans were also a hot topic last year, with several cities passing plastic straw ordinances. The European Union, meanwhile, finalized an agreement to reduce consumption of all single-use plastics, including Styrofoam, by 2021. But some people think Styrofoam bans are more trouble than they’re worth. In a piece for JSTOR Daily, writer Katherine Martinelli spoke to recycling and manufacturing experts who say Styrofoam has advantages over other packaging products. Trevor Zink, an assistant professor of management at the Institute of Business Ethics and Sustainability at Loyola Marymount University, told Martinelli that polystyrene is so light, it has “lower production and transportation impacts than other products.” “Foam is one of the more high utility polymers — very low cost, tremendous value, easy to manufacture — it’s the polymer of choice for things like shipping, food, electronics, etc.,” Joe Vaillancourt, CEO of the Oregon-based chemical recycling company Agilyx, which breaks plastic waste into hydrocarbon products, told Miller. But Styrofoam is harder to recycle than other plastics because the waste system wasn’t designed to handle it. Styrofoam is only recyclable in some parts of the country — Maine isn’t one of them — and isn’t accepted by most materials recovery facilities, according to American Disposal Services. Even in cities and states where Styrofoam is recyclable, it’s often so contaminated by food or drink that it won’t be accepted by most recycling facilities, meaning it often ends up in landfills, where it doesn’t biodegrade. Given the difficulty of recycling Styrofoam, it makes sense that Maine would decide to outright ban it instead — but this is just the first step in reducing our dependence on single-use plastics.

910,910,11-01-19 16:40,2019,1,11,Alex Abad-Santos,Netflix’s Sex Education review: a sweet and raunchy charmer of a series,"2019 has barely begun, but a contender for the year’s best show about sex and love has already emerged. In spite of its too-clever-by-half title and under the guise of a raunchy premise, Netflix’s Sex Education — the tale of a dorky teenage boy named Otis Milburn and his sex-positive, overenthusiastic sex therapist mom — has executed a thoughtful and charming debut season. A lot of that is due to star Gillian Anderson’s bombastic performance as the aforementioned unapologetically sex-positive mom. But what sets Sex Education apart from other shows that concern themselves with adolescence, sex, and love is its tenderness. Instead of perpetually treating the sex lives of teens as a childish joke, the show’s directors, Kate Herron and Ben Taylor, tend to them with kindness. That isn’t to say that Sex Education somehow avoids silliness or gross-out humor, because there are at least two instances of handjob pantomimes and a fellatio-related vomit anecdote in the first couple of episodes alone. But there’s no sneering at teenage ideas of lust or love, or at feeling rejected or insecure. Nor is it cruel. Sex Education takes all those emotions seriously and doesn’t discount them just because they happen in the brains, loins, and hearts of 17-year-olds. And in doing so, the show becomes something familiar, sweet, and relatable — even if your teenage years are decades in the past. On paper, the humor of Sex Education isn’t that far-fetched. Otis (Asa Butterfield) is the son of a sex therapist (Anderson) who really has no boundaries when it comes to talking about masturbation, vaginas, penises, performance anxiety, sex, drugs, and everything in between. Within that narrative frame, you might expect the show to hit the familiar cringe beats of uncomfortable “birds and bees” talks and the dark horror of knowing your parent or parents are having sex for enjoyment. And it certainly does, at times. Anderson is seemingly having the time of her life playing a platinum-haired, no-holds-barred sex therapist. She gets to say dastardly things like “man milk” and is described by one of Sex Education’s other characters as a “sexy witch.” How many takes Butterfield might have required to not burst into laughter at Agent Scully chattering about “man milk” is a mystery we may never know, but he’s equally charming — albeit in a stiffer, more vulnerable way. But Sex Education doesn’t linger long in that mode, as it soon steers away from mother-son awkwardness into something more earnest. Because while being the son of a sex therapist has thrown a curve into Otis’s sexual development — thinking about one of your parents every time you masturbate or have sex can do that to a person — Otis has actually listened to everything his mom has had to say about sex and intimacy. So he becomes his school’s sex shrink, for better or worse. Otis is someone his peers can talk to when they can’t go to their parents. This leads into a different kind of comedy about the fear of sex, yes, but also about the anxiety of relationships and self-worth. In one episode, for example, he asks one of his “clients” to explore their insecurities about their body and where they come from. And this unique relationship with his fellow high school students reveals all the things he can’t say to his own mother. He can’t exactly tell her that he wants to find a romantic relationship deeper than her various one-night stands, nor can she ever know that her endearing effort to be sex-positive has actually had a negative effect on Otis’s sexual development. Pop culture has given us plenty of stories about how zany sex-crazed teenagers can be, but Sex Education is one of the rare works that go beyond that trope to give depth and validation to teenage insecurities and emotions that coexist with raging hormones and mythic sex drives. In telling stories about teenage sex anxieties, Sex Education is cleverly relatable. Teens are supposed to be silly and clumsy about life, since they’re experiencing everything adult — freedom, love, heartbreak, shattering disappointment, core-shaking joy — for the first time. Sex Education understands that for humans, and young humans especially, a lot of these experiences are rooted in sex and romance. Being rejected by someone you find desirable hurts in a special kind of way. Embarrassing yourself in front of someone you want to impress burns differently than more run-of-the-mill public shame. A relationship becomes different once sex enters the equation. The genius of Sex Education is that it knows the biggest difference between adults and teens is that adults are a lot more aware of their own unavoidable silly clumsiness. And whether you’re watching as a teen or an adult, laughing at teens being thrown into fraught romantic and anxiety-inducing situations is a way (an easier way, perhaps?) for us to also laugh at ourselves. The first season of Sex Education is now streaming on Netflix.",https://www.vox.com/2019/1/11/18176920/netflix-sex-education-review,,Vox
911,911,20-06-16 00:00,2016,6,20,Yeganeh Torbati,"In separate speeches Obama, Biden, Carter target Trump policies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, his vice president and defense secretary took aim on Monday at policies of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump they said would alienate Muslims globally along with U.S. allies and neighbors.  In a speech focusing on national security at a think tank in Washington, Vice President Joe Biden said Trump’s calls to bar the entry of Muslims and to profile Muslim Americans reflected the politics of fear and intolerance.  “There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world” Biden said. “Some of the rhetoric I’m hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion.”     Biden’s attacks on Trump as an isolationist, and others by Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter represent an unusually early and vigorous assault on an opposing party’s presidential nominee. The election is on Nov. 8.  Referring to Trump’s vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden said that the most complex threats do not respect borders and a wall would destroy much of the progress the Obama administration had made with U.S. neighbors.  “If we build walls and disrespect our neighbors, we will quickly see all this progress evaporating, replaced by a return of anti-Americanism, a corrosive rift throughout our hemisphere,” Biden said.  Obama, who last week assailed Trump for what he called a “dangerous” mindset and “loose talk and sloppiness” in defining the country’s enemies, on Monday criticized  Trump’s anti-trade policies in a speech at a U.S. Commerce Department conference.  “This is not just about jobs and trade, it’s not just about hard, cold cash. It’s also about building relationships across borders,” Obama told the 2,400 people from 70 countries at the conference to attract foreign investment.  Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports and demanded a change in a U.S. trade policy he says allows other countries to shut out U.S imports, devalue their currencies and unfairly target U.S. industries.  Speaking at the same event as Biden, Carter said a critical part of U.S. leadership is its “longtime network of allies and partners in every corner of the world.”  “Our allies around the world have stood with us - and fought with us - time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL,” he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Carter did not mention Trump, who has called NATO “obsolete” and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China.While Obama, Carter and other top officials generally have refrained from attacking Trump by name, Obama administration spokesmen have not denied that such remarks are directed at the presumptive Republican candidate.

912,912,27-03-18 00:00,2018,3,27,Elena Goukassian,A Graphic Novel that Basks in the Aura of Film,"Herman by Trade reads just like a storyboard for a film — perfectly fitting for a tale of a humble street cleaner caught up in the frustrating process of open auditions for a movie. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads There’s something magically unique about a graphic novel that integrates the aesthetics of the story its about to tell long before the reader even reaches the beginnings of a plot line. Herman by Trade, Toronto-based artist Chris W. Kim’s first graphic novel, reads just like a storyboard for a film from its very first panel — perfectly fitting for a tale of a humble street cleaner caught up in the frustrating process of open auditions for a movie. The first four pages of panels set the scene. A wide-angle shot of a metropolitan waterfront. A boat passes by. Ducks swim in the boat’s wake. The water crashes on the boardwalk, where a man walks his dog. Eventually, a mysterious cloaked figure walks by, and from the opposite direction, Herman drives his garbage-collecting golf cart along the boardwalk. The reader soon finds that Herman is much more than just a cleaner. He’s a master of disguise, able to transform his appearance into a variety of different people and characters. He goes home after work one day, metamorphosing into a tall shadowy man in a cloak, and decides to join the long line at a movie theater for a popular film about street performers. The movie, Gare, is celebrating its 20th anniversary, and when it ends, the genius director appears onstage to the lively standing ovation of an audience dressed up for the occasion. The director declares that she’ll be holding open auditions for a new film on the waterfront. Intrigued, Herman decides to audition … as does everyone else in the theater and a large portion of the rest of the city. When Herman finally makes it to the audition tent after waiting in line for days — already rejected once and losing his job in the process — he shows off his skills as a chameleon. The director first hires him to act as the “connective tissue between each performer,” morphing from one person to the next as they walk along the waterfront, but she soon discovers he can just play all the parts. It’d be easier to shoot the film in a single shot anyway. Needless to say, the rest of the performers are less than thrilled. Throughout the book, the aura of film continues to seep in, not only through the careful framing of panels, but also in the way Kim handles the dialogue. The artist’s use of expressive speech bubbles is nothing short of amazing. Speech bubbles overlap to show people talking at the same time. They disappear into the background and become illegible (inaudible) as characters recede into the distance.

On one hand, he’s extremely talented, yet dismissed as a simple cleaner. Then again, at the behest of the surly auteur, Herman actively steals the identities and talents of the rest of the actors on set. By the end of the book, it seems Herman may have just dropped into the universe of the story in order to teach the people of the waterfront a valuable lesson about community and individuality. But even that is left ambiguous. In the last six-panel page of Herman by Trade, the reader watches from an alley as people walk by. Businessmen. Families. Policeman. Students.

Mevlüt Cavusoglu was flying to Rotterdam in the Netherlands after a rally he had been due to speak at had been cancelled. The rally's aim was to garner support for a ""Yes"" vote in the Turkish referendum which would grant the president sweeping new powers. Speaking in Istanbul, Erdogan responded by proposing retaliatory measures. Al Jazeera quoted him as saying: ""You can stop our foreign minister's plane all you want, let's see how your planes will come to Turkey from now on."" ""They do not know politics or international diplomacy. These Nazi remnants, they are fascists."" The mayor of Rotterdam says the rally was cancelled due to ""risks to public order and security."" Austria, Germany, and Switzerland have also banned Turkish officials from attending similar gatherings aimed at winning the support of Turkish expats eligible to cast a ballot in the referendum. The Dutch government said they had been working with their Turkish counterparts to find a way of hosting Cavusoglu's visit, but in a statement posted to Facebook, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: ""Before these talks were completed, Turkish authorities publicly threatened sanctions. That makes the search for a reasonable solution impossible."" ""These meetings should not contribute to tension in our society, and everyone who wants to organise a meeting should adhere to instructions of the authorities so that public order and safety can be guaranteed."" ""The Turkish government that rules in this matter does not want to respect that,"" he said. Before his trip, Cavusoglu had said sanctions against the Netherlands ""would be heavy"" if they cancelled his flight permit, saying ""I am a foreign minister and I can go wherever I want."" If Erdogan and his government win the April 16 referendum, an executive presidency would replace the existing parliamentary system of government and the office of the prime minister would be abolished. Turkish officials have been attempting to win the votes of Turks living throughout the EU — including 1.4 million living in Germany — by holding rallies in a number of countries.",https://www.businessinsider.com/turkeys-president-erdogan-the-dutch-government-are-nazi-remnants-2017-3,,Business Insider
914,914,04-10-17 00:00,2017,10,4,"Jonathan Allen, Alex Dobuzinskis",Las Vegas gunman 'doted' on girlfriend but may have kept secrets,"(Reuters) - At the casino in Reno, Nevada, where they met several years ago, Stephen Paddock was a “big fish” and Marilou Danley a petite hostess.  “They were adorable,” Paddock’s younger brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters this week. “He loved her. I mean he doted on her.”  The brother was not surprised, then, by news reports that wealthy retiree Stephen Paddock may have sent $100,000 to the Philippines to be collected by Danley.  She was traveling there when her live-in boyfriend carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, gunning down 58 people at a Las Vegas concert on Sunday night before killing himself.  Danley, 62, returned to the United States on Tuesday and was being interviewed by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in Los Angeles. Authorities have called her a “person of interest.”  Two officials briefed on the case said that as of midday Wednesday, there was no indication she was aware of Paddock’s plans.  Danley said in a statement read by her attorney Matt Lombard in front of the FBI’s office in Los Angeles that she had no advance warning of the attack and that Paddock had sent her out of the country, telling her the money was to purchase a home in the Philippines for her family.   Eric Paddock also said Danley might not be able to give investigators any clues.  “Mary Lou (sic) is absolutely the closest person to Steve,” the brother told Reuters in a series of text messages elaborating on their relationship. “My fear is that he manipulated around her, and she’s not going to know any more than anyone else does.”  Danley has not been charged in the case and told her family she has a “clean conscience” following the Las Vegas attack, her brother said in an interview with ABC News in the Philippines.  The portrait emerging of her stands in stark contrast to that of Paddock.  While he had few friends and kept to himself, Danley is warm and outgoing, according to media interviews with family, neighbors and friends.  Danley was born in the Philippines and moved to Australia where she married and became an Australian citizen, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin, an Australian newspaper.  She was married for more than 20 years to her second husband, Geary Danley, and the couple moved to Nevada when they retired, the New York Times reported.  A voicemail recording for Sheila Darcey, Marilou Danley’s daughter, directed reporters to her mother’s attorney.      “She is a good and gentle person, and I know she has to be devastated by what has happened,” Dionne Waltrip, the daughter of Geary Danley and Marilou’s former stepdaughter, told KHOG-TV in Arkansas.  Marilou Danley described herself on her now-disabled Facebook as a “proud mom and grandma who lives life to the fullest.” Her account was full of photos with family members and trips overseas.  She was working as a hostess at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nevada’s third-largest city, when she met Paddock, a wealthy gambler, according to his brother.   The casino said in a statement only that she stopped working there “several years ago.”   Paddock bought the newly constructed two-story house on Babbling Brook Court, a cul-de-sac on the edge of the small city of Mesquite in January 2015, state property records show.  Danley and her then-husband Geary Danley filed a joint petition for divorce in Reno a month later, according to court records.  She was sympathetic in dealing with Paddock’s allergy-driven quirks, Eric Paddock told Reuters.  Paddock often wore brown cloth gardening gloves to prevent rashes from contact with cleaning chemical residues, the brother wrote.   He was also allergic to many pills and was unable to renew his pilot’s license — he had flown planes since he was a teenager — because he could not take the pills needed to reduce his blood pressure.   At casinos where he was a regular, he was such a valued customer that staff obliged his requests to wash his room’s carpet with plain water.   “The reason Mary Lou looks so plain in that picture they keep posting of her is because for him she would not wear perfumes or hair sprays or anything with scents in it because it affected him,” Eric Paddock wrote, referring to a passport-style photo of Danley that has been widely circulated by news outlets.

916,916,17-09-18 00:00,2018,9,17,Danielle Wu,How Capitalist Power Compensates for Racial Oppression in Crazy Rich Asians,"Obscene wealth, and its spectacular power to compensate for racial loss, is the central protagonist we are invited to cheer on in Crazy Rich Asians. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads When was the last time a generic romantic comedy faced such scrutiny? I am chagrined to pen any self-serious, heavy-handed opinion that treats Crazy Rich Asians as anything other than the lighthearted joyride it attempts to be. Indeed, a critique at this point might only signify misplaced expectation. The hypocrisies and contradictions are obvious: these “crazy rich Asians” are celebrated as harbingers of racial progress while producers bank on the hope that audiences will forget how capitalism has always been inextricably linked to racial oppression. However, it feels naive to expect authenticity or sincerity from Hollywood when it has always manufactured fictions that seduce us into abandoning our realities. Instead, I ask how Asiatic bodies are afforded such sudden visibility. Is the film really so different from an industry recently outed as one of the most repressive, white, sexist, and exploitative machines via the #MeToo movement? Or, is it more likely that the film too, despite its all-Asian cast and Asian director Jon M. Chu, is still vulnerable to the same racial and gendered logic that warranted its production? Crazy Rich Asians begins in 1995, when madame Eleanor Sung, played by the elegantly fearsome Michelle Yeoh, glides into a posh hotel and prepares to flip tables as if on an episode of Undercover Boss. Her furs are dripping from the raging storm outside, but we surmise that she can afford to toss them anyway, and her two children track mud across the gleaming marble floor. The (racist) concierge tries to turn them away; but no, they’ll be sorry, because: Eleanor has money! Obscene wealth, and its spectacular power to compensate for racial loss, is the central protagonist we are invited to cheer on in Crazy Rich Asians.  Fast forward to 2018, and Eleanor’s son Nick Young, played by Henry Golding, has grown distant from his wealthy family. Young’s extravagant endowments are slowly unveiled to an unsuspecting girlfriend Rachel Chu, played by Constance Wu, once they travel together to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore. Between then and now, has-beens and soon-to-be’s, cultural wholeness and successful assimilation correlate directly with dollar signs. The bachelor parties would make a Baz Luhrmann remake of The Titanic blush. If McMansions embarrass us in their failed ambition, then try the McAcropolises in Crazy Rich Asians. Throughout these grandiose scenes, no one is more othered or shocked from the spectacle than the most “foreign” Asian subject who just arrived from America: Rachel Chu.  Greed is easy to dismiss, and yes, there is predictably plenty in a film called Crazy Rich Asians. Yet, there has been little examination of what excessive capital promises racially denigrated subjects. In her book The Melancholy of Race, Anne Anlin Cheng writes about melancholia as a metaphor for the process of racialization in America and asks, “How to bury the remnants of denigration and disgust created in the name of progress and the formation of an ‘American identity’?” Apparently, with any major credit card. In a manic gesture that attempts to reverse discrimination through inversion, the film attempts to compensate for the racialization of Asians like Eleanor Young through the performance of overabundance. The primitivist stereotypes of Asia, such as dirty streets and dog meat made popular by films like Mondo Cane (1962), are transformed instead into decorative and ornamental glamor: million-dollar gems and ravenous spending habits.  Like many “Asian” Hollywood films, Crazy Rich Asians relies almost entirely on the bodies of Asian women in order to resolve the anxieties between Eastern and Western identity. Eleanor finds beef with her son’s American-raised, low-income girlfriend Rachel, activating the old (read: tired), binary schisms between seemingly polar opposites that never mix well. Here we are invited to feel fear for a miscegenous relationship: a regressive, traditional, despotic East and a progressive, modern, free-spirited West. Rachel’s illegality and pennilessness (almost equatable with Chinese-lessness throughout the film) is outed by a catty network of primarily women. The film’s humor relies on the fundamental irony that wholesome Asian beauties like Rachel can be othered in a place that, by Orientalist logic, should be welcoming. The character Peik Lin, embodying the long tradition of simultaneous Black and Orientalist minstrelsy, pokes fun at Rachel’s inward whiteness in saying, “she’s gonna think you’re a banana — yellow on the outside, white on the inside.” Although the banana metaphor identifies Rachel’s interior as foreign, her outer foreignness is just as palpable. Whiteness is continuously mapped onto her body as one that is severely lacking: in ornamentation, vibrancy, luxury, surgical injection, and implants. From recent cinematic tradition such as Blade Runner and Ex Machina all the way back to the 18th-century exhibition of the first Asian woman in the United States, Afong Moy’s “tiny lotus feet,” Asiatic femininity is repeatedly “proven” and theatrically revealed through extreme artifice. Naturally, Rachel embarks on a quest to prove her racial wholeness through artificial attachment. This forced peacocking is achieved through sartorial transformation, such as her mother’s insistence that she wear a red dress for its auspicious symbolism (as opposed to a later dress disturbingly characterized as a “slutty ebola virus” and thus, unfit), to witty scenes involving mahjong, where Rachel outsmarts her future mother-in-law by beating her in a so-called “intrinsically Asian” game, in which knowing the rules is a form of authenticating her ethnicity.  This compensatory behavior might be taken simply as materialist consumption if not for its racialized connotations. I am reminded of The New Yorker’s “Crying in H Mart,” a powerful article written recently by Michelle Zauner (aka Japanese Breakfast), in which she reckons with how shopping in an ethnic grocery store becomes one of the only viable options in white American society in which to connect with her Korean mother. As in “Crying in H-Mart,” in Crazy Rich Asians the process of being reunified with cultural commodities is only a balm for a deep melancholia. This is perhaps why its storyline — despite all the valid circulating critiques of how it is shallow and uninventive, even racist and colorist — might not even matter for some viewers who are eager to have racial loss compensated. At the end of the film, we see again how this logic is deployed. Eleanor gives Rachel her own wedding ring, which promises not just a moneyed future, but also forgiveness, approval, and cultural belonging. The film itself, like this shiny well-intentioned gemstone, is a glitzy offering that asks for a redemption that perhaps will never be reconciled. Crazy Rich Asians is screening at theaters nationwide. ",https://hyperallergic.com/460504/how-capitalist-power-compensates-for-racial-oppression-in-crazy-rich-asians/,,Hyperallergic

That $35 includes unlimited mobile data for your TV viewing, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's digital conference. The service will debut in November. DirecTV Now will be a package of live TV delivered over the internet wherever you are — no cable box or satellite dish necessary. It will target the 20 million people in the US who don't have pay TV, but the company plans for it to be the primary TV platform by 2020, according to Bloomberg. DirecTV Now's $35 price point undercuts the early industry norms for live-streaming TV. The market leader Sling TV charges $20 for ""25+"" channels, and its highest package has about 50 channels for $40. Sony's PlayStation Vue charges $54.99 for about 100 channels, and its lowest package gives you ""60+"" channels for $39.99 a month. Other competitors including Hulu and YouTube are reportedly readying their own packages for streaming live TV but have yet to name a price. DirecTV Now seems to be blowing them all out of the water on price, though the full catalog of channels has yet to be announced. It will have channels from Time Warner, NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, and others. AT&T can afford the low price point because it didn't have to create and service legacy equipment like satellite dishes, Stephenson said. As is the norm for ""over-the-top"" services like Netflix or Sling TV, DirecTV Now also won't lock you into an annual contract. Pay TV as an app DirecTV Now won't break the mold of pay TV; it will simply make the delivery more fluid and improve on price. ""It's pay TV as an app,"" AT&T's senior vice president of strategy and business development, Tony Goncalves, told Business Insider in a recent interview. AT&T sees itself as an ""aggregator of aggregators,"" and its strength will be in the breadth of content it provides (more than 100 channels), as well as in a pain-free technical experience. As a user of Sling TV, I have had many tech issues, and that element should be factored in prominently. Stephenson also said DirecTV Now would eventually be bolstered by AT&T's 5G network. He presented 5G as an alternative to broadband moving forward. Time Warner This announcement comes on the heels of AT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. The deal, if it goes through, would link AT&T's ""pipes"" — wireless, broadband, and satellite — to Time Warner's media properties, which include HBO, CNN, and Warner Brothers.

920,920,12-10-16 15:10,2016,10,12,German Lopez,The DEA won’t ban kratom after all,"Just last month, the federal government was moving to ban a drug that you’ve probably never heard of: kratom. But in an unprecedented move, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has changed its mind — the agency plans to publish a proposed rule on Thursday that will instead solicit public feedback on what to do with the drug. The move is not totally surprising. Shortly after the DEA posted its initial declaration that it will ban kratom, it admitted that it had received an unusual amount of public backlash. ""That was eye-opening for me personally,"" DEA spokesperson Melvin Patterson told the Washington Post. ""I want the kratom community to know that the DEA does hear them. Our goal is to make sure this is available to all of them."" But the take-back is unusual for the DEA. Throughout America’s war on drugs, the DEA has leaned on the aggressive — usually moving quite quickly to ban drugs when it perceives any chance of public risk. In the case of kratom, the DEA will instead solicit feedback until December 1 to give the public and interested parties time to speak up about whether kratom should be banned or otherwise regulated. The DEA previously explained that its initial move to ban the drug was largely an act of caution. As it stands, we simply don’t have much research on kratom — not its recreational use, nor its medical use. The DEA, in an abundance of caution after reports of rising use recently, moved to ban the drug for two years while it figured out how kratom works and the proper permanent regulatory classification for it. The move, however, angered pain patients, some of whom were already getting the drug over online retailers. As the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, some pain patients have turned to alternatives to opioids to ease their pain without as big of a risk of addiction and overdose. One of those alternatives is kratom, which appears to have — although, again, we don’t know for sure, since the research is scarce — fewer deadly risks than opioids, yet can still relieve people’s pain. This is the issue at hand: The DEA said there’s not enough evidence to legally allow widespread public consumption. But people who have used the drug for years say a ban would leave them out to dry, forced to suffer in pain, illegally buy kratom, or turn to more dangerous drugs, like opioid painkillers, for relief. Before we get into all of that, though, it’s important to understand kratom — a drug that is relatively new to Americans, but has a long history in Southeast Asia. Kratom has been used in Southeast Asia for centuries, in part acting as an energy boost much like coffee does for Americans and coca leaves do for many people in northwest parts of South America. The Transnational Institute, a research and advocacy group, reported in 2011 that kratom ""is chewed in teashops, at certain ceremonies (though this practice is fading), and other informal social events, as well as while engaging in manual labor and in the comfort of one’s own home. Eating kratom is a tradition that has been practiced for centuries in southern Thailand and up to 70 percent of the male population in some districts use kratom daily. Indeed, many people in southern Thailand consider chewing kratom similar to drinking coffee."" The best overview of kratom’s effects comes from a 2015 study published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study noted that there wasn’t rigorous scientific research on kratom’s effects on humans. So it instead analyzed hundreds of anecdotal accounts from Erowid, a popular website for drug users and researchers, to gauge its effects. The study found several positive effects (from most to least common): euphoria, relaxation, enhanced sociability, increased energy, pain relief, sensory enhancement, and warmth or tingling. It also found some negative effects (from most to least common): nausea and stomachaches, withdrawal (from addiction), chills and sweats, dizziness and unsteadiness, vomiting, hangovers, and itching. Reviewing other research, the study found no good evidence that kratom alone has caused deadly overdoses. According to the study, the pain relief element has become particularly promising for pain patients who want to seek alternatives to highly addictive, potentially deadly opioid painkillers. The study also found that kratom may aid with easing withdrawal from opioid addiction. The Transnational Institute, in its 2011 report, noted these benefits have been known in other parts of the world for a long time: Many studies report that the effect of kratom on the body reduces pain from withdrawal symptoms and helps manage detoxification. Interviews with [Thai] community members and leaders indicated that many people have been using kratom to wean themselves off heroin, yaba, and even alcohol and tobacco dependence. Indeed, 60 years ago, when kratom became a controlled substance in Thailand, its potential for management of opiate dependence had been widely recognised. But how do the positives and negatives of kratom compare to opioid painkillers and other drugs? Chris Ingraham, who’s done a lot of great reporting on kratom at the Washington Post, scoured Erowid for positive and negative anecdotal accounts for several drugs and how they compared to the positive and negative accounts for kratom. He put them all together in this chart, which suggests that kratom is less risky than marijuana and the opioid painkiller oxycodone: Now, this isn’t a scientific ranking, since it’s based on the anecdotal accounts of drug users on Erowid who are most likely using these drugs for recreational purposes. Still, the ranking suggests kratom is relatively safe. So why did the DEA move to ban it? The DEA’s initial decision to ban kratom came as the drug had slowly gained some popularity in the US. With that popularity came more negative reports of kratom abuse: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of calls involving kratom to US poison centers ""increased tenfold from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015."" And the DEA has tracked 15 deaths linked to kratom between 2014 and 2016 — although none of those deaths were directly attributed to kratom, since people often use it with other drugs. Given these concerns, the DEA at first concluded that it needed to ban kratom to ""avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety."" So it moved to classify kratom as schedule 1 — meaning the agency would consider kratom to have high potential for abuse and no recognized medical value, and banning its sales and production. (As of now, kratom is on the DEA’s list of ""drugs of concern,"" meaning the agency is keeping an eye on the drug but not officially banning it.) But the biggest issue for the DEA seemed to be that we just don’t know enough about kratom. Generally, in the US, drugs are regulated to ensure their safety and effectiveness. The DEA’s mission is in large part to ensure that drugs are not being abused recreationally, but also to ensure that drugs that are often abused recreationally are available for use as medicine if there’s research to support medical use. It typically does this by locking drugs into different schedules that measure potential for abuse and medical value. The rub here is the research: Large-scale clinical trials — the kinds the Food and Drug Administration requires for traditional medicines — are typically necessary to prove illicit drugs have medical value. Once these trials show that, for example, kratom can be used safely and effectively as medicine, it can be classified as schedule 2, 3, 4, or 5, the schedules of drugs that have high to low levels of abuse and some medical value. (Schedule 1 is the only classification for drugs that have no recognized medical value, which is how you end up with marijuana and heroin in the same schedule 1 category.) This research could help answer some of the big questions surrounding kratom: How well does it relieve pain, and how well does that pain relief hold up as long-term users build tolerance? Can kratom cause deadly overdoses by itself? How addictive is it? What are the short-term and long-term effects, good or bad, we don’t know about? Does kratom affect most people in the same way, or can it only benefit a certain segment of the population? Until that research is done, kratom doesn’t have enough evidence, based on the scheduling system, to support its medical efficacy and safety. So the DEA wanted to classify it as schedule 1 as researchers studied the drug. But sometimes the process doesn’t work. We see this with marijuana: Patients have reported that pot helps them with varying medical conditions for at least decades. Yet the government has been slow to allow and fund research in large part due to its view, made official by marijuana’s schedule 1 classification, that pot has no medical value. The result is we have some studies that show it can relieve pain and can potentially substitute far deadlier opioid painkillers for some pain patients — but we don’t have research large and rigorous enough to get marijuana officially approved as medicine by the DEA. There’s already a dearth of research on kratom. With the federal government’s ban, there was a very real concern that the research on kratom could remain stagnant — just like it has for marijuana. The DEA didn’t seem to think this would happen. Patterson, the agency’s spokesperson, told the Post that he doesn’t ""see it being schedule 2 [or higher] because that would be a drug that’s highly addictive."" He added, ""Kratom’s at a point where it needs to be recognized as medicine. I think that we are going to find out that probably it does."" Still, the DEA’s move terrified kratom users. The American Kratom Association described the DEA’s proposed ban in very grim terms: TAKE ACTION TO SAVE KRATOM NOW!!! We are now facing our darkest hour. The DEA has filed a notice of intent to schedule and ban kratom by September 30th, 2016. Countless people depend on this safe and effective herbal remedy related to coffee that was sacred to the Buddhists, who have used it safely for thousands of years. Many of you depend on this healing leaf for your general well-being, pain and suffering, depression, anxiety, PTSD, opioid dependency, and more. There was good reason for the sense of urgency: As the opioid epidemic kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, many people are scared they’re going to lose a relatively safe alternative to opioid painkillers if the kratom ban takes effect. The DEA apparently took those concerns seriously enough to withdraw its proposed ban — at least until it gets public feedback. The timing of the DEA’s move was particularly concerning to kratom advocates because the country is currently mired in a huge public health crisis — the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic — that kratom could help fight. Here’s the quick summary of the opioid epidemic: In the 1990s, doctors were under enormous pressure to treat pain as a serious medical issue — with good reason, as roughly one-third of Americans suffer from chronic pain, according to a 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine. As pharmaceutical companies pushed the drugs through an aggressive, dangerously misleading marketing campaign, doctors prescribed excessive numbers of opioid painkillers — getting a lot of people hooked on the drugs and letting excess painkillers flood the black market. Opioid painkiller overdoses steadily increased, reaching epidemic levels by the 2010s. Over time, these opioid users developed a tolerance and sought a better high. They turned to heroin, which has long been cheaper, more potent, and — especially after the government crackdown on painkillers to fight addiction — more available than opioid painkillers. As a result, heroin deaths rose. (A 2015 analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that people who are addicted to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.) With heavy emphasis on the fact the research on kratom is by no means conclusive, it seems kratom could help mitigate this epidemic by substituting opioid painkillers for some pain patients. Since kratom doesn’t appear to cause deadly overdoses frequently or at all while opioid painkillers do, replacing opioids with kratom could prove a public health gain. And since kratom doesn’t appear to cause the kind of addiction that leads to heroin use, it could also stop people from getting on a pathway to a much more dangerous, deadlier drug. But if the DEA shut down legal supplies of kratom, pain patients would no longer be able to legally access the drug. If that forced them to turn to opioid painkillers or, worse, heroin, that could be a horrible outcome for public health. The DEA had good reason under the current legal framework to act in this way — as noted above, there’s just not enough research to determine kratom’s full medical efficacy and safety. But kratom’s potential and the ongoing threat of the opioid epidemic suggest that the current legal framework is perhaps too inflexible for a world with bigger, more pressing public health crises than a drug that’s not even proven to be unsafe. The DEA, for its part, now seems to recognize that — so it will let the public speak before it takes further action on the drug.",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12941112/kratom-dea-ban,,Vox
921,921,23-03-17 00:00,2017,3,23,"Lawrence Hurley, Andrew Chung",Top Senate Democrat promises fight to block Trump high court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. Senate Democrat on Thursday pledged to pursue a procedural hurdle to try to block the confirmation of Republican President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, a move that could provoke a nasty partisan fight and change the way the Senate does business.  Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate, leaving Democrats with an uphill battle to prevent Gorsuch’s confirmation. But Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation’s highest court.  Trump has called on Senate Republicans to change the long-standing rules in order to allow a simple majority vote on confirmation if Democrats mount a filibuster. If eventually confirmed as expected, the federal appeals court judge from Colorado would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court, fulfilling one of Trump’s top campaign promises.  As the Judiciary Committee completed its fourth and final day of Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing, the spotlight turned to whether he gains the support of vulnerable Democratic senators facing re-election in 2018. The support of eight Democrats would short-circuit a filibuster.  “After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court,” Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor, a day after Gorsuch finished marathon Judiciary Committee testimony.   “He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be ‘no,’ and I urge my colleagues to do the same.”  White House spokesman Sean Spicer called Schumer’s remarks “truly disappointing” and urged him to abandon the filibuster threat, saying it was the type of partisanship Americans have grown tired of. Spicer said Trump, in light of Schumer’s comments, would discuss Senate confirmation strategy with Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  Conservative activists have said they have identified 10 possible “yes” votes for Gorsuch among Democrats seeking 2018 re-election in states Trump won in the 2016 presidential  election.  Democratic Senator Bob Casey, up for re-election in 2018 in one of those states, Pennsylvania, announced he would vote against Gorsuch and support a filibuster.  “I don’t believe that Judge Gorsuch, his judicial approach, would ensure fairness for workers and families in Pennsylvania,” Casey said, expressing “serious concerns about Judge Gorsuch’s rigid and restrictive judicial philosophy.”  Casey said he was unaware of any discussions among Democrats about a deal to advance Gorsuch’s nomination in return for a guarantee from Republicans that the next Supreme Court nomination would need 60 votes to proceed to a Senate confirmation vote.  Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, facing re-election in Wisconsin next year, also opposes the nomination, a spokesman said. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Florida’s Bill Nelson, Democrats facing voters next year, remain undecided on Gorsuch, their spokesmen told Reuters.  Several Judiciary Committee Democrats, including its top Democrat Dianne Feinstein, declined to comment on whether they would support a filibuster.  Another vote potentially up for grabs is that of Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado. He is not up for re-election next year and his state voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He introduced Gorsuch to the Judiciary Committee on Monday, but did not commit to supporting confirmation, promising an “open mind.”  Schumer said if Gorsuch cannot attract 60 votes, “the answer isn’t to change the rules. It’s to change the nominee.” Schumer said Gorsuch failed to convince him he would be “an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint from executive overreach” or that he would be a neutral justice “free from the biases of politics and ideology.”  Democratic committee members on Tuesday and Wednesday pressed Gorsuch on rulings he participated in that they said showed a inclination to decide in favor of corporate interests and against what they called “the little guy.” Democrats  expressed frustration about his refusal to answer questions on whether Supreme Court rulings favoring abortion, contraception and gay rights were correctly decided.   The Judiciary Committee was due to vote on the nomination on April 3. McConnell planned a full Senate confirmation vote before senators begin a recess on April 7.  On Thursday, the committee heard about six hours of testimony from witnesses supporting and opposing Gorsuch, including representatives of the American Bar Association, the lawyers group that evaluates such nominees and gave Gorsuch its highest rating of “well qualified.”   Feinstein noted that Merrick Garland, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee who the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider for confirmation, also earned the ABA’s highest rating.   Another witness was Jeff Perkins, father of an autistic son who Gorsuch ruled against in 2008 in a special-education dispute using legal reasoning repudiated by the Supreme Court in a related case on Wednesday.  Perkins said Gorsuch set a “new low standard” for educational benefits school districts must offer disabled students. “I was devastated,” Perkins said of Gorsuch’s ruling.

924,924,03-10-17 20:10,2017,10,3,Kurt Wagner,Snap’s Evan Spiegel admits that he needs to communicate better with Wall Street,"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel says he has no regrets about how or when he took his company public earlier this year, even though the stock is down almost 40 percent since its opening-day close. One thing that surprised him, though: How important it is to communicate with public market investors. “One of the things I did underestimate was how much more important communication becomes,” Spiegel said on Tuesday at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles. “When you go public, and you really need to explain to a huge new investor base — instead of having 10 investors, you have 10,000 — you have to explain how your business works, and at the same time that you need to do that, there are also all these new regulations about what you can and can’t say.” After the company’s first earnings call, Spiegel was grilled for being flippant about competition from Facebook. CNBC’s Jim Cramer called him “arrogant.” “One of the things we’ve been going through this year is learning how to best communicate the Snap story,” Spiegel continued. (Thankfully, Spiegel’s No. 2, Imran Khan, is a former Wall Street banker!) Spiegel says has miscommunicated “so many things,” but one was the importance of self-expression, and why it’s valuable. Unlike decades past, where conforming to the status quo was important, young people are understanding the value of being unique, he says. “There’s a profound shift that’s happening right now, I think, towards empowering people to express themselves and be the best version of themselves,” he said. “And that’s really different than, sort of, this past generation that was sort of seeking acceptance, trying to be liked. I think that’s why people have a hard time understanding the power and importance of creativity.” (Snapchat is a product that enables that creativity, of course.) Spiegel, who rarely does public speaking events and was interviewed on stage by the writer Walter Isaacson, said there isn’t one specific thing that Wall Street doesn’t get about his company. Instead, he thinks, there is a general fear that Snap won’t ultimately make it, and that’s normal. “Investors are fearful, and I think that fear is a powerful motivator,” Spiegel said. “So they’re fearful that we’ll never be profitable, or they’re fearful that competition will kill us or something like that. But I think those are kind of normal fears really for any startup, and that the really successful companies just grow through that.” Spiegel’s public speaking practice was on display. When Isaacson asked if he thought Google and Facebook needed more human oversight to combat fake news — a struggle Snap hasn’t had to deal with, given that its publisher section, Discover, is limited to select partners — he stalled. “You can just say yes if you want,” Isaacson joked. “I’m trying to learn to be diplomatic,” Spiegel said. (On cue, Spiegel answered by talking about Snapchat, without ever mentioning Facebook or Google.) Spiegel spent a large portion of his interview talking about creativity, and how Snapchat helps people be more creative by doing things like opening users into the camera, instead of a feed of other peoples’ content. The interview started with a video of artist Jeff Koons, who is partnering with Snapchat to put augmented reality versions of his famous ballon artwork into the app via Snapchat’s filters product. Snapchat is asking other artists to reach out, presumably for other partnerships, but the company hasn’t specified how that will work. Snapchat unintentionally let the partnership with Koons leak out on Monday. The company quietly started a countdown clock on its website signaling that an announcement was coming, but wouldn’t say what the announcement was. But the internet is not a patient place, and someone discovered that you could see what was behind the countdown clock by changing the date on your computer’s clock. Oops!

925,925,17-06-19 00:00,2019,6,17,Stephanie Kelly,Oil prices fall 1% as economic worries outweigh tanker tensions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1% on Monday after more poor Chinese economic figures fanned fears of lower worldwide oil demand.  Brent crude futures lost $1.07 to settle at $60.94 a barrel, a 1.73 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 58 cents to settle at $51.93 a barrel, a 1.10 percent loss.  Prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 high reached in April, in part due to concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and disappointing economic data.   China’s industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to a more than 17-year low, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. It grew 5.0% in May from a year earlier, missing analysts’ expectations of 5.5% and well below April’s 5.4%.   U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping could meet at the G20 summit in Japan later this month. Trump has said he would meet with Xi at the summit, although China has not confirmed the meeting.  “All the major reporting agencies are reporting that demand is going to be weaker,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “That has played into the market malaise. Things we would normally rally off of, we’re not.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its Brent price forecast to $63 per barrel from $68 a barrel for the second half of 2019 on faltering demand.  Worries remained about increased tensions in the Middle East following last week’s attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The United States blamed the attacks on Iran but Tehran denied involvement.  Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that countries need to cooperate on keeping shipping lanes open for oil and other energy supplies to ensure stable supplies.  Market participants also await a meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to decide whether to extend a production cut agreement that ends this month.   The group has been considering since last month moving the date of their policy meeting in Vienna to July 3-4 from June 25-26. After a meeting on Monday, Iran’s oil minister said he told his Russian counterpart that he still disagreed with the early July dates but could attend if the dates were shifted to July 10-12, the Iranian oil ministry’s news agency SHANA reported.   OPEC+ agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1.   In the United States, U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise by about 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July to a record 8.52 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly drilling productivity report on Monday.

Sushi began as a fish preservation method in southeast Asia. In China along the Mekong River, fish would swim into rice paddies during the monsoon season. After they amassed a great number of fish, farmers needed a way to store them for an extended time. They began pickling the fish by salting it, packing it under weights (to help with the fermentation process) with cooked rice, and sealing the fish in a barrel. After some time, the fish would be eaten and the rice thrown away.  It wasn’t until this preservation method made its way to Japan, during the eighth century, that the rice would be eaten with the fish. In the 1960s, Sushi landed in America via the sushi bar Kawafuku in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo. Since then, sushi has been shaped and rolled with copious amounts of food from all over the world, but rice has always been integral.

929,929,23-10-18 20:03,2018,10,23,Kurt Wagner,Facebook’s top political ad spender is ... Facebook,"The political advertiser spending the most money on Facebook ads is ... Facebook? Just two weeks ahead of the midterm elections, the social network released a new “ad archive report” outlining which politicians and political groups have spent the most money on Facebook ads over the past six months. Ironically, Facebook topped its own list. (Well, technically, Facebook didn’t include itself on its own list, but included its spending as a footnote instead.) The social network has spent almost $12.5 million in the past six months to promote its own election integrity products, including the ad archive itself, which shows users who paid for what political ads. (Even though Facebook owns the platform, it still runs ads through the same system as other advertisers. The money simply changes pockets.) Second on the list was Beto O’Rourke, a Democratic congressman from Texas who is running for the Senate against incumbent Ted Cruz. O’Rourke has spent more than $5.3 million on more then 6,000 ads. Third on the list: President Donald Trump, who, of course, is not up for reelection until 2020. The ad archive is new this year. Facebook announced it last year as part of its plan to avoid another election disaster like it had in 2016, when Russian trolls used Facebook to try and sow political discord among voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The thinking is that clearly labeling all political ads, and showing who paid for them, will help prevent bad actors from manipulating Facebook users. Despite taking first place on the list, Facebook is not a traditional political advertiser. None of the ads Facebook ran over the past six months are for a specific candidate or issue, but they are focused on the election. That Facebook outspent all of the actual political candidates and parties gives you a sense for how desperate the company is to convince its users that it’s taking the upcoming midterms seriously. O’Rourke’s race against Cruz will be one to watch. Early poll numbers show Cruz has a notable lead over O’Rourke in a very conservative state, but Cruz has spent just $424,000 on Facebook ads since May, according to the data. O’Rourke has spent more than 10 times that much. We may never know if that money was well spent or not, though Facebook has been suggested as a key differentiator in helping both Trump and President Barack Obama win past elections. Here are a few other example of political ads on Facebook from top spenders, like President Trump and and Concealed Online, a group trying to “help citizens gain the education to safely handle firearms and successfully defend themselves and their families.” This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",https://www.vox.com/2018/10/23/18015228/facebook-top-political-ad-buyers-trump-beto-elections,,Vox
930,930,31-08-16 00:41,2016,8,31,Alex Abad-Santos,"Anthony Weiner and the rise of dick pics, explained","When former Congress member Anthony Weiner was born in Brooklyn in 1964, scientists and engineers hadn’t yet figured out to harness the (then nonexistent) internet to send text messages, let alone use that mind-blowing power to send pictures of one’s own genitalia to others in an attempt to flatter them. Despite predating the term ""sext"" by 40 years, Weiner, as if it were the destiny of his surname, has become infamous for his sexting scandals, the first of which cost him his job as a US representative for New York. A new scandal was revealed on Sunday. ""Someone just climbed into my bed,"" Weiner wrote in a sext to a woman, which was then relayed to the New York Post. ""Ooooooh . . . I was scared. For half a second I thought I posted something. Stop looking at my crotch."" The ""someone"" Weiner was referring to was his 4-year-old child, Jordan Zain. Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, have probably taken countless photos of Jordan — during parties, birthdays, Halloween, grandparent visits. But this one, with Jordan’s cherubic face within breathing distance of Anthony’s semi-engorged member (which is barely concealed by a pair of white briefs), and one that Weiner apparently thought he tweeted to the world, will haunt Weiner and his family forever. Weiner isn’t the only person who has sent out a sext, nor is he the only man to send someone a photo of his junk. Thanks to technology and the human desire to use and interact with that technology, dick pics have become common. It seems like it's impossible to go very long without a celebrity, not just Weiner, accidentally exposing themselves on the grand stage of the internet. But what makes this latest Weiner scandal newsworthy is that it goes beyond the scandalous dick pic he’s sending. Weiner is like the Icarus of dick pictures and sexts, if Icarus were given three sets of wings and multiple chances not to burn and drown in the sea. A dick is a nickname frequently applied to male genitalia. Dicks, on their own, are neutral. They vary in size, shape, and appearance. People often project subjective traits onto dicks, like saying a dick is good when it’s aesthetically pleasing and of satisfactory size and girth. And a dick pic is a picture of a dick. The term ""dick"" can also refer to a person — usually in a negative sense, to refer to someone who is selfish, irritating, or stubborn. There is an entire world of slurs based on male and female genitalia, which seems a bit unfair to genitalia since genitalia on its own never really harmed or slighted anyone. And a dick pic, while often a flirty exchange between consenting adults, can also be seen as a form of harassment, a crude byproduct of the way our lives revolve around technology, or a symbol of bad judgment, among other things. Anthony Weiner is considered a dick for his slew of scandals and incorrigible behavior. In this he follows the political path blazed by former President Nixon, whose first name inspired the political catchphrase ""Dick Nixon before he dicks you."" On Sunday, it was revealed that Weiner had sexted a picture to a woman that featured him in his underwear and his child’s face. It kicked off his third sexting scandal in five years — the first resulted in Weiner resigning from Congress in 2011, while the second sank his run to become Mayor of New York City. This third scandal is a publicly embarrassing ordeal for Weiner, his wife, and his family, and it comes with personal loss, too. Abedin announced on Monday that she is divorcing him, saying she needs to leave him for the best interests of their son. She said in a statement: After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. The time frame of their divorce is unclear. Weiner has yet to formally respond to the photos and the story, but his Twitter account was deleted in the wake of the new allegations. Dick pics between consenting adults are often harmless, but this one clearly was not. Dick pics fall under the bigger umbrella of sexting, a term that first appeared in newspapers in 2004 and refers to messages of a sexual nature that are sent from one person to another (or multiple people; I’m not judging). Today, the term primarily refers to messages that include pictures. Dick pics are also a part, even without Anthony Weiner's generous contribution to the ""genre,"" of pop culture and sex. To be clear, in this piece I’m referring to dick pics sent between two consenting adults, not unsolicited dick pics that are sent as a form of harassment, which does happen and is a serious problem. Consent is crucial when it comes to dick pics. Unsolicited dick pics and sexts are more than an annoyance — they make recipients feel unsafe and degraded. As technology advances, it regularly lets us do things we once didn’t think were possible, or that we were once told we shouldn’t do. Back when I was a child, I was told never to meet anyone in person whom I’d only talked to on the internet, and never to get into a stranger’s car. Now, thanks to Uber, thousands of people including myself completely disregard those rules with a startling confidence and no fear of getting murdered. (Uber completed a billion rides in 2015.) Sending pictures of your genitalia to other people — which can now be done in the span of a few seconds, or however long it takes to snap a photo with your smartphone and text it to someone — is no doubt a technological advancement, and an act that one performs in hopes of getting a positive response. No one takes a picture of their penis in the hopes that it deters sex. It’s a penis, not a scarecrow. In the world of dick pics, like any kind of photography, really, there is such a thing as a good picture and a bad one. Men want to make their seem dicks enticing, which means a proud, rigid dick. And while there may be a fetish for it, the majority of people who like and possess dicks don’t usually want to see a sad, wilting, moody penis. ""I’ve mostly sent [dick pics] after a few flirtations back and forth with girls I’ve met online who seemed to want to hook up."" Gerry, a man who regularly sends dick pictures, told Refinery29, in an investigation the site conducted among dick picture–sending men. But Gerry’s extracurricular photography might be counterproductive. In Match.com’s 2013 ""Singles in America"" survey, the site spoke to 5,675 single American adults and found that the majority of women surveyed don’t really enjoy receiving dick pics. Clearly, someone must have responded positively to one of Gerry’s and other men like Gerry's photos, since they are using the tactic again and again (and perhaps again and again). The problem for heterosexual men like Gerry hoping to entice heterosexual women into sex or compliments or positive emojis by sending a photo of their dick is that it’s unclear whether this actually has a positive effect. Sexting is a relatively young phenomenon. We’re beginning to study and understand it more, but the data is still changing and at times seems to contradict itself. A 2015 study led by a researcher at the Kinsey Institute found that 21 percent of the study’s 5,805 participants (2,830 women and 2,975 men) had sent sexts, and 28 percent had received sexually explicit text messages. These numbers don’t match up with a 2015 report from researchers at Drexel University, in which more than eight out of 10 people (870 total respondents) they surveyed online admitted to sexting in the prior year. Further, according to a 2014 report from Pew Research, sexting is usually done by young people: When it comes to gay and bi men, and men who have sex with men, dick pics are much more common. According to a National Institutes of Health study from 2013, 75.7 percent of the sample (1,500 men who have sex with men) reported sending and receiving sexts. Those numbers match up with a survey from GrabHim.com, which found that 83 percent of gay men have sent a dick pic. Further, these studies don’t take into account the number of dick pics and sexts that recipients forward and share with other people. The first rule of sexting, as Weiner has found out three times, is that you must understand the person your dick pic is intended for might not necessarily be the only one who sees it. We’ve reached the point in pop culture where regular dicks and regular dick activities — becoming stiff, not becoming stiff — aren’t shocking anymore. This summer, during the rage of the Pokémon Go boom, a site called (Warning: NSFW) Poke Peen was created. Poke Peen featured users taking advantage of Pokémon Go's augmented reality feature and turning them into dick pics. In the same spirit, there's a popular Tumblr called (Warning: NSFW) ""Things My Dick Does"" where a man takes dick pictures and turns them into cartoonish sequences by photoshopping illustrations. The result is more amusing than arousing. And the same goes for dick pics that are shared by accident. Late last month, NBA player Draymond Green accidentally posted a picture of his Draymond on Snapchat. It was highly ironic that a player who carved out a reputation for himself for some dirty plays on the basketball court, including (allegedly) hitting opponents in the nuts on purpose, would post his own dick online. ""We’re all one click away from placing something in the wrong place,"" Green told reporters after initially saying he was hacked. ""I suffered from that."" No one said Green was some kind of awful deviant. There was no massive call to fire him. There were mostly just laughs. What happened to Green was something that could happen to any adult, and the incident was ultimately relatable. And while Weiner has accidentally sent out his photo, there’s a big difference in his behavior and Green’s. A photo of a lounging adult male with semi-recumbent genitalia is an intriguing mystery, a chance to discover whether you've arrived just in time or a moment too late. But the addition of a child's innocent face anywhere in the frame transforms it from mystery into horror. No one wants to see that. There are images whose very existence makes the universe a worse place in which to be alive. But let’s zoom out a little bit. There’s nothing wrong if two or more consenting adults want to share nude pictures with one another. There’s nothing wrong with nude photos. Other than having to deal with the potential fallout, there’s nothing wrong with accidentally messing up and putting nude photos online. When it comes to Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, we don’t know the terms of their marriage. Nor are those terms really any of our business. What Weiner and Abedin privately allow or don’t allow in their relationship has no bearing on our own personal relationships. But what makes Anthony Weiner different from Draymond Green is much more than Weiner’s extremely poor and disgusting judgment of sexts. It’s the incongruence between the man Weiner says he is in interviews with magazines and the actions he takes, not to mention the embarrassing toll his behavior has taken on his career and family. Green never promised he was a sterling person. He admitted his mistake and moved on. Each time Weiner has faced a sexting scandal, it’s been followed by a promise that his behavior doesn’t reflect his values, along with a vow of reform. The first scandal involved him accidentally sending out a photo on Twitter instead of using the social media site’s direct message feature — that ultimately cost him job in Congress in 2011. In July 2012, Weiner appeared with Abedin and their son, who was then still a baby, in People magazine. He told the magazine in an exclusive interview, ""I'm very happy in my present life. … The only next dramatic steps I'm planning on are Jordan's first"": A New York City mayoral run followed this spread — one he was doing decent in, until another sexting scandal occurred in 2013. After resigning, Weiner admitted he had three online/sexting relationships that were finished, but this was proven false when a new woman named Sydney Leathers came forward with sexts he sent her under the alias Carlos Danger. Weiner then amended the number of relationships to somewhere between six and 10. Over the past five years, Weiner has lost his job and his marriage, and damaged his relationship with his child (custody seems very slim given the circumstances), because he has repeatedly sent women pictures of his genitalia while promising us that he isn’t that guy. And now that we’re in the third cycle of this pattern, the most egregious thing about Weiner isn’t so much the sexts he’s sending (although the picture with his child is undoubtedly foul) but rather the discussion of whether this man might have a more serious, compulsive problem or sex addiction. Dicks aren’t supposed to make you sad. Yet this one, this Weiner, has managed to do just that.",https://www.vox.com/2016/8/30/12699194/anthony-weiner-sexts-dick-pics-scandal,,Vox
931,931,06-06-19 00:00,2019,6,6,,Trump to make China tariffs decision 'right after G20',"CAEN, France (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would make a decision about whether to impose a further series of tariffs on Chinese goods after meeting his Chinese counterpart at the G-20 meeting in Japan later this month.  Trump earlier threatened to hit China with tariffs on “at least” another $300 billion worth of goods, but said he thought both China and Mexico wanted to make deals in their trade disputes with the United States.   “I will make that decision I would say over the next few weeks, probably right after the G20,” Trump said ahead of talks with French President Emmanuel Macron  in Normandy, where they attended a ceremony for the 75th anniversary of D-Day.  “One way or another I’ll make that decision after the G20. I’ll be meeting with President Xi (Jinping) and we will see what happens,” Trump said.  Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have risen sharply since talks aimed at ending a festering trade war broke down in early May.  While Trump said on Thursday that talks with China were ongoing, no face-to-face meetings have been held since May 10, the day he sharply increased tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods to 25%, prompting Beijing to retaliate.

932,932,15-01-16 00:00,2016,1,15,Ginger Gibson,Quarter of Republicans think Cruz's birthplace disqualifies him for president: poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A quarter of Republicans think White House hopeful Ted Cruz is disqualified to serve as U.S. president because he was born in Canada to an American mother, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.  Republican voters nearly mirror independents and the broader electorate in their belief that Cruz cannot hold the White House, with 27 percent of all voters and 28 percent of independents responding he should be disqualified.  Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas who was born to a U.S. citizen mother and Cuban father in Calgary, Alberta, has brushed aside the attacks about his eligibility as pure politics. But the questions could hamper his ability to rally the broad Republican support he would need to win the party’s nomination to run for the presidency in November’s election.  Only 47 percent of all voters surveyed responded that they thought Cruz is qualified to be president with regard to his citizenship, with 26 percent saying they were not sure.  The poll was taken from Jan. 7 to Jan. 14, before questions about Cruz’s eligibility became one of the most heated moments of Thursday night’s Republican primary debate.  New York businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump has made questions about Cruz’s eligibility a regular attack line on the campaign trail and the debate stage.   “I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you’re running, and if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?” Trump said during Thursday night’s debate. “So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.”  But Cruz tried to use Trump’s own previous words against him in response.   “Back in September, my friend Donald said that he had his lawyers look at this from every which way and there was nothing to do this,” Cruz said. “Since September, the Constitution hasn’t changed, but the poll numbers have.”   Trump became a conservative darling in 2011 when he repeatedly questioned President Barack Obama’s eligibility to be president, insisting that the president may have been born in another country and demanding to see his birth certificate.  Obama was born in Hawaii. It made Trump one of the most well-known “birthers,” a term used to describe those who insisted Obama had been born elsewhere.  The constitutional issue at question is the requirement that a president be a “natural born” citizen.  Cruz, 45, has argued that because he became a citizen at the time he was born, that makes him qualify as natural born. But his opponents argue that at the time of the writing of the Constitution, natural born would have required being born on American soil.  U.S. Senator John McCain, who ran as the Republican nominee in 2008, was born in Panama, but argued he met the requirement because his birth took place on a U.S. military installation, which is the same as American soil.  The poll, which has a confidence interval of 5 percentage points, posed two questions to two separate polls of voters. One group was asked about Cruz’s eligibility. The other half was asked a generic question about the eligibility of anyone born in Canada with an American parent.

935,935,22-03-16 14:40,2016,3,22,Zack Beauchamp,Why Trump didn't quite succeed at AIPAC — even if he came pretty close,"Randy Herman, who lives in Westchester County, New York, attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference. He's a strong supporter of the Jewish state. He's also a Democrat — and no fan of Donald Trump. ""He incites people to violence. He incites people to hatred. He's on a fascist-demagogue continuum,"" Herman, who works as a cantor (religious singer), says. Yet after listening to Trump's speech to the AIPAC conference on Monday evening, he was strangely sympathetic to the orange-haired firebrand. ""I was so horrified to discover that he was winning me over,"" he continued. ""Not to his policies, but I started liking him. He was so much more sophisticated."" A lot of AIPAC conference-goers had similarly mixed feelings after Trump's address. Almost all of them came in skeptical that Trump was a true champion of Israel; there was even talk of a mass walkout during Trump's address. But the speech itself was greeted with thunderous applause. That's because Trump hit all the right notes for a pro-Israel audience. He boasted of a lifetime of support for Israel, blasted the Iran deal, and said that ""the Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable."" He walked off to a standing ovation. Yet despite the palpable enthusiasm during Trump's speech, attendees still didn't seem ready to support Trump after he left the room. Every conference-goer I spoke to liked what he actually said about Israel, but they didn't quite trust the messenger. That speaks to a bigger problem for Trump's campaign. Trump has succeeded in winning the allegiance of a major chunk of the Republican Party. But his long history of wild statements and outlandish behavior make it hard for a broader audience audiences to really get behind him — even when he tells them exactly what they want to hear. It seemed, at first blush, like Trump succeeded at AIPAC. But looks might be deceiving. Trump's address was heavily scripted, an unusual move for the candidate, who prefers to freestyle his stump speeches. Sure, a few Trumpisms crept in: He said he had studied the Iran deal ""in greater detail than almost anybody,"" prompting guffaws from the audience. But on the whole, Trump stuck to a prewritten speech, the text of which hewed very closely to standard Republican talking points on Israel. ""The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,"" Trump said. Previously, he had previously pledged to be ""neutral"" on the Israel-Palestine conflict, a stance in line with official American policy on the conflict. He went further in attacking the Iran deal than ever before. ""My number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,"" he said. Prior to last night, he had committed to implementing the Iran deal, saying that ""it’s very tough"" to rip up a deal once it's made. Trump also got in a few partisan jabs, calling Obama ""maybe the worst thing that ever happened to Israel."" This, too, was greeted with wild applause. Clearly, Trump was giving a speech carefully crafted to appeal to a staunchly pro-Israel audience, and particularly the conservatives in that audience. Strip away the references to deals and Trump knowing more than ""anybody,"" and his speech was virtually identical to what other Republicans said in their speeches to AIPAC. For all Trump's denunciations of politicians, he was essentially acting like a conventional politician. ""He said all the right things,"" conference-goer Steven Greenbaum told me afterward. ""Pandering takes on a whole new definition,"" said Elizabeth Milstein, another attendee. Hence the raucous applause during Trump's speech. It's very easy to know what to say to this audience: Israel is America's closest friend, Iran is evil, the failure of the peace process is all the Palestinians' fault. It would be very hard for people who share AIPAC's view of the conflict to avoid applauding a candidate saying those things, even if they came in skeptical of Trump's commitment to Israel. ""It's not hard to say all the things for this crowd,"" Sheri Greenbaum, another attendee, said. What this shows, then, is how ritual invocations of support for Israel have become in American politics. There's a set of platitudes that everyone is expected to say, which any minimally competent politician can easily identify. Say the magic words in your speech, and you too can get a standing ovation at AIPAC. The problem, though, is that it's not clear that getting applause translates into getting support. Virtually everyone I talked to after the speech, a group that included Democrats and Republicans and ranged from high school students to retired folks, said that they weren't ready to vote for Trump — even though he said all the right things. ""Trump is a guy that you're dating, gives you smooth lines, but he's still a scumbag,"" Jessica Epstein, a self-identified #NeverTrump Republican, told me. ""He gave all the red-meat lines ... but he'll say something different tomorrow."" ""Since Trump announced previously on Israel that he's neutral, a lot of people are nervous,"" Ethan Y. Zadeh, a conservative student at UCLA, said. ""We don't want a future president who's going to be neutral."" These are, of course, just a few individuals — a handful of anecdotes don't amount to data. But the uniformity of the response was really striking, and points to what looks like, from actual data, a real problem for Trump. If you look at national polls, Trump's favorability ratings have always been negative. In fact, a majority of Americans have always disapproved of Trump, and the gap appears to be widening: For Trump to win, he needs to narrow this gap. His plan, as he's said openly, is to change his tune: to stop acting so out so much and become the kind of person who seems credible in a general election. ""I will be changing very rapidly,"" Trump said in a mid-February Fox appearance, ""as I get closer and closer to the goal."" But the problem for Trump is that the wall-to-wall media coverage of his antics may have cemented his negative image. That is, he may try to reach out to new audiences, but nobody will trust the new, sober Trump. That's why the skeptical reaction of the AIPAC crowd should worry Trump. It's easy, as the attendees all said, to write applause lines. It's much harder to wish away the fact that you've said and done things, outside of prepared speeches, that directly contradict the image you're trying to sell in this speech. ""I thought it was superficial, highly structured, and not delivered convincingly,"" conference-goer Marvin Schlanger said of the speech. ""He tried to address the elements that the audience was interested in, but it was delivered in a Trump style that I don't find particularly serious."" The AIPAC conference, then, may be Trump's first real stab at acting like a conventional politician: pandering to a specific interest group and delivering an unremarkable prepared speech. But it's possible that he's just not set up to do that kind of politics after months of the Donald Trump Show.",https://www.vox.com/2016/3/22/11283812/aipac-trump-2016,,Vox

937,937,13-01-17 00:00,2017,1,13,"Richard Cowan, Susan Cornwell",House votes to begin repealing Obamacare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans on Friday won passage of a measure starting the process of dismantling Obamacare, despite concerns about not having a ready replacement and the potential financial cost of repealing Democratic President Barack Obama’s landmark health insurance law.  The House of Representatives voted 227-198 to instruct committees to draft legislation by a target date of Jan. 27 that would repeal the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The Senate approved the same measure early Thursday.  No Democrats supported the initiative. Nine Republicans voted against the measure.  With this vote, Republicans began delivering on their promise to end Obamacare, which also was a campaign promise of Republican President-elect Donald Trump.  The program, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people, has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system.  The resolution passed by the House and Senate does not need presidential approval, since it is part of an internal congressional budget process. But once the Obamacare repeal legislation is drafted, both chambers will need to approve it, and a presidential signature will be required.  By that time, Trump will have been sworn in as president. He has urged Congress to act quickly to repeal and replace the Democratic program.  Obamacare was enacted nearly seven years ago - over Republican objections - in an effort to expand coverage and give new protections for people with pre-existing health conditions and other barriers that left them without insurance.  In the past few years, the House has voted more than 60 times to repeal or alter Obamacare, but Republicans had no hope a repeal would become law as long as Obama was president and could veto their bills.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said Obamacare was collapsing and action was urgent. For people who have health insurance through the Obamacare system, he said, “The deductibles are so high it doesn’t feel like you’ve got insurance in the first place.  “We have to step in before things get worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission,” Ryan said.  Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rebutted Republicans’ claims that the law was a failure.  “The rate of growth in healthcare costs in our country has been greatly diminished by the Affordable Care Act,” she said. “In the more than 50 years that they have been measuring the rate of growth, it has never been slower than now.”  The choice before lawmakers, she said, is “affordable care versus chaos.”  Harvard University economist David Cutler warned that there could be trouble in U.S. insurance markets if lawmakers do repeal the law but a replacement is slow in coming.  “You could create a lot of havoc,” he said, adding that some insurers “may get out of the market entirely.”  Trump applauded Congress’s efforts with a Friday morning tweet saying, “The ‘Unaffordable’ Care Act will soon be history!”   The president-elect, who takes office on Jan. 20, pressed lawmakers this week to repeal and replace it “essentially simultaneously.”  Republican leaders would like to finish the repeal process within weeks, but some lawmakers think it could take far longer.  Some Republicans have expressed concern about starting a repeal before agreeing on how to replace provisions of the complicated and far-reaching law.   The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated repealing Obama’s signature health insurance law entirely would cost roughly $350 billion over 10 years.  Republicans say a good replacement would give states more control of a healthcare program and provide more stability on health insurance premiums.

938,938,01-03-17 00:00,2017,3,1,Claire Voon,Abstracting the Data of the Natural World with Colorful Geometries,"Julie Wolfe tries to make sense of the natural world by gathering and categorizing all kinds of sights and objects that offer no scientific information but inspire search for meaning, like puzzles. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads WASHINGTON, DC — In her solo exhibition at the Katzen Arts Center, artist Julie Wolfe attempts to confront a massive question: How do we find peaceful coexistence between our human systems and the natural world? Quest for a Third Paradise — which draws its name from Michelangelo Pistoletto’s concept that envisions harmony between nature and artifice — provides no firm answers. But it insists that the path to such a paradise requires an awareness of the variety of languages we have devised and can devise to organize and understand our surroundings. The many, many works on view, curated by Claire D’Alba, show how Wolfe herself is trying to make sense of the natural world by gathering and categorizing all kinds of sights and objects through myriad visualizations that offer no scientific information but inspire search for meaning, like puzzles. Filling the entirety of the museum’s top floor, the exhibition is huge and wavering, comprising large-scale paintings; installations of found objects and small sculptures; many, many painted-over pages cut from books; and one video work. The unifying thread is Wolfe’s use of joyous color and simple geometries, deployed as her visual vocabulary to suggest how we ourselves may build and structure our relationship to the urban environment in conscientious, creative ways. Wolfe deconstructs, rearranges, and literally paints over traditional means of information. She covers one wall with dozens of pages detached from history encyclopedias, each now covered in brightly painted symbols that could be innovative data visualizations of the now-illegible content printed decades ago. Below it, she’s created a large color wheel out of found books ordered not by their very specific subjects (flower arranging, the Classical world, American Kennel Club dogs) but by color. She eschews familiar systems once more in her series of gouache, enamel, and ink on paper works, In a Day Flight. These reimagine researchers’ carefully determined flight patterns of planes and birds in schematic drawings where arrows and lines connect in cryptic, biomorphic forms. Wolfe’s tiny notes and diagrammatic labels egg you to figure out what kind of message these hold, but they are her personal recordings of her observations, understood by their maker alone. Wolfe best highlights the influence of our own perspectives in her diptych “The Color of Pigeons” (2016), which is informed by the Lüscher Color Test — developed to suggest that how people respond to colors determines their psychological state. It presents eye-popping grids of different colors, each labelled with adjectives like “superhuman,” “brand-new,” “delicate,” and “negligent.” Uprooting the informative design of a color swatch and absurdly repurposed (pigeons, of course, come in only so many colors), it celebrates the fact that individuals do have unique visions; situated in this exhibition, the paintings prompt the question of how we may collectively negotiate our different views to promote a society that functions within the broader complexities of the natural world.  In other installations, Wolfe reminds of what’s at stake if we don’t work together towards this peaceful coexistence. A cart outfitted with magnifying glasses invites us to get close to precious gems that gleam and mesmerize, although they are already displaced and sanitized. “Green Room 2” (2016) is a live laboratory of glass bottles containing over 200 water samples Wolfe collected from waterways across the country over five years. While the samples are dyed and arranged so the display forms enticing rainbow-hued shelves, the vessels hold wilting plant samples, industrial chemicals, and even objects, from lightbulbs to wires. They are examples of ecological imbalance that will decay over the exhibition’s run — sending a message about our urban environments that needs no particular language for us to understand it. Julie Wolfe: Quest for a Third Paradise continues at the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center (4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC) through March 12.",https://hyperallergic.com/360938/abstracting-the-data-of-the-natural-world-with-colorful-geometries/,,Hyperallergic

He joined the Nationals’ organization earlier in the month after being designated for assignment by Oakland. Rodney was recalled from the minors earlier this week.

Nicholas Castellanos’ homer accounted for the lone Detroit run. The Tigers have lost 21 of their last 23 home games.  Detroit starter Daniel Norris (2-7) left after five innings with a cut on his pitching thumb. He allowed two runs on five hits and a walk, and he fanned three.  Tigers center fielder JaCoby Jones was a late scratch after fouling a ball off his foot during batting practice. He struck out in a pinch-hitting appearance in the ninth.  Leading off the second, Soto crushed an 0-2 Norris offering for a 418-foot home run to right.  The Nationals stranded two runners in the fourth when Kurt Suzuki flied out.  Washington scored the next inning, thanks to Victor Robles’ speed. He reached on a single, stole second, advanced on a groundout and scored on Adam Eaton’s single to right.  Castellanos made it 2-1 in the bottom of the inning with his two-out homer to right-center that traveled an estimated 436 feet.  The Nationals gave themselves a little breathing room in the eighth.

The Democratic brief noted that the Justice Department, which would usually be tasked with defending a federal law from a legal challenge, has instead decided to join the Republican-led states in arguing that Obamacare’s individual mandate and other key provisions in the law are now unconstitutional. “While the Department of Justice normally defends the validity of Acts of Congress when they are challenged in court, here it has joined the plaintiffs in attacking the validity of the individual mandate,” the motion reads. “The House has a unique institutional interest in participating in this litigation to defend the ACA against the remaining challenges, and intervention should be granted.” Twenty Republican states brought the lawsuit arguing that since the ACA’s individual mandate penalty was repealed in the Republican tax bill, the entire law is now invalid; they leaned on the logic in Chief Justice John Roberts’s decision in the 2012 case challenging the law, in which Roberts found the mandate was justifiable as a tax, to make their case. They’ve been joined in part by President Donald Trump’s Justice Department, which argued the mandate and the law’s provisions protecting people with preexisting conditions must be overturned — but not the rest of the law. Medicaid expansion, for example, would remain. Federal Judge Reed O’Connor agreed with the states in December and ruled Obamacare should be overturned entirely. However, his decision has been put on hold (allowing the law to stay in place for now) while Democratic-led states appeal the ruling to a higher court. The mechanics here are a little wonky. O’Connor has, technically, only ruled on one question of several that the Republican states brought in their litigation. House Democrats have therefore asked the judge to allow them to intervene on the remaining counts that are still unresolved. They will, simultaneously, ask the appeals court to let them join the appeal being brought by Democratic states that seeks to reverse O’Connor’s decision to invalidate all of the ACA. Legal experts — who are generally dismissive of the lawsuit, on the basis that if Congress wanted to overturn the rest of Obamacare when they repealed the mandate penalty, they would have — believe the first count, already ruled on and appealed, is the most important. So in a certain sense, the House motion on Friday is symbolic. The bigger question is whether they are given standing to participate in the Democratic states’ appeal of O’Connor’s ruling. House attorneys said they would seek to intervene in that case as soon as they are able; there is not yet a case number for the appeal. But the point is clear: House Democrats, fresh off winning an election where health care was a major issue, want to be allowed to stand in court and defend Obamacare. They are now taking the necessary legal steps to do so.",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/4/18168543/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge-new-congress-2019,,Vox

WorldFirst, a global leader in international money transfers, analysed seven countries to see how the US compares with the rest of the world in terms of living and working conditions. The organisation looked at job demand, accessibility of visas, the cost of living, and working conditions. Seeking new opportunities abroad can be exciting, but living and working conditions vary around the world, with differing visa requirements, paid maternity leave and cost of living. In the US, the average cost of rent stands at $1,671, while transport comes in at around $94. Compared with other countries, the main sectors in which jobs are in demand include mathematics, information technology, health, teaching, and writing. Different visas are available depending on whether you have a job offer and, often, you need at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent. Visas can be renewed indefinitely depending on where you're from and can allow an applicant's spouse to live and work in the US. WorldFirst, a global leader in international money transfers, analysed seven countries to see how the US compares with the rest of the world in terms of the jobs in demand, accessibility of visas, the cost of living, and working conditions.

Make the poolish: Mix the flours, yeast, and water together in a mixing bowl or in the mixer set on low for 1 minute. Place it in an airtight plastic container, with room for the poolish to grow, overnight in the cooler or at room temperature for 3-4 hours. 2. Make the sauce: Using a stick blender, pulse the canned tomatoes to a consistency you like (slightly chunkier for G-ma style, smooth for thin crust). Mix in all other ingredients and let rest in the fridge overnight. 3. Make the pizza dough: Place the flour, poolish, water, sugar, salt, oil, yeast, and malt powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment. Mix on low for 5 minutes, then switch to high for 5 minutes. Place the dough in a large, well-oiled plastic container. Give the dough several folds, then cover the dough with an oiled lid. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. 4. Give the dough a fold, then let it rest for another 3-4 hours, up to overnight. 5. After it has rested overnight, divide the dough in half and place the dough on a well-oiled board. Shape the dough into a ball. Place each on 2 parchment paper-lined baking sheets that have been well-oiled. Rub oil on the top of each dough and lay a sheet of plastic wrap on top to prevent any skin from forming. Place the sheet trays at room temperature for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. Once the dough has doubled in size and appears to bubble all over, gently work the dough into the corners of each pan, creating a rectangular shape and making sure the dough is even across the pan. It is better to have the edges a bit thicker than the middle. Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes at room temperature, adjust any dough. 6. Heat the oven to 450°F. Top each dough with 1 1/4 cups sauce. Divide the cheese over the top of each, along with whatever toppings you like. It’s best to go on the lighter side with sauces and toppings so the dough can bake thoroughly. Bake the pizzas, rotating from the bottom of the oven to the top so the bottom of the pizza can get good color, 25 to 30 minutes. Finish with parmesan cheese, chili flakes, dried oregano, and a drizzle of olive oil.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43pq3b/detroit-style-pizza-recipe,Food by VICE ,Vice

947,947,29-01-16 18:47,2016,1,29,Jake Hughes,A Brief History of MMA Fighters on Reality TV,"Since the Nevada Athletic Commission suspended Chael Sonnen from competing in MMA for two years following a failed drug test, ""The American Gangster"" has done his best to keep busy and remain relevant in the fast-moving world of MMA. Sonnen doesn't have long left to serve of that suspension, but he has indicated he won't be making a return to the Octagon once the ban has expired. In that time, he has since become a MMA analyst for ESPN and now hosts his own successful podcast which sees him retain his prominent voice within the sport. Now, Sonnen will be appearing on this year's edition of Celebrity Apprentice on NBC—hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger in Donald Trump's absence as he attempts to insult as many people as possible during his ongoing bid to become the Republican presidential candidate. Sonnen will be joining the likes of Laila Ali, Snooki, Boy George and Vince Neil to compete to win $250,000 for his favorite charity. There have been plenty of TV appearances from MMA fighters over the years, ranging from run-of-the-mill chat show spots to Ronda Rousey's episode of Saturday Night Live last week. But, the most common TV format to feature MMA stars is reality TV. Tito Ortiz, Luke Rockhold and Tim Sylvia are among those to take the brave step into the murky world of reality TV—hell, even Frankie Edgar is friends with the Jersey Shore cast. Here's a summary of how MMA fighters have fared when making their reality TV bow. Celebrity Apprentice: Tito Ortiz Tito Ortiz has also had the chance to try and win over Donald Trump in the seventh series of the show—a season which featured fellow fighter Lennox Lewis, Piers Morgan and some other people a Brit like me wouldn't really know anything about. Sonnen would be wise to learn from Ortiz's shortcomings, with the ""Huntington Beach Bad Boy"" receiving his marching orders in episode nine—an episode which saw his first attempt at being a project manager. Ortiz largely flew under the radar up until his final appearance on the show. But, his debut stint as project manager made for car crash television, fluffing his lines in an important presentation in a similar fashion to his attempt at being an in-ring interviewer at the Affliction shows. Celebrity gossip magazine People was particularly scathing: ""On Thursday's Celebrity Apprentice, Tito Ortiz showed that he may have taken one or two hard blows to the head in his UFC fighting career. While giving a presentation to executives from Dove and Redbook as his team's project manager, Ortiz stumbled through his speech, hardly making a clear point. The fractured grammatical twists gave the suits pause as they listened, their brows furrowed in confusion about Ortiz's words."" Ouch. Blind Date: Tim Sylvia, Pete Spratt, Tiki Ghosn Where do I start? Former UFC heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia, Josh Thomson, Pete Spratt and Tiki Ghosn all appeared on Blind Date in the mid '00s with mixed results. Sylvia, fresh off his infamous loss against Frank Mir which saw his arm almost snapped in half, had a date with a girl more interested in alcohol than the former heavyweight champ of the world. Josh Thomson's date also went badly after he was accused of being too nice for essentially being a gentleman and not trying his luck on the first ""date"". A shout out goes Pete Spratt was the sole UFC fighter to have a successful date. Millionaire Matchmaker: Luke Rockhold In 2015, current UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold appeared on Millionaire Matchmaker—a show which tries to find love for young, rich and desirable men who remain single due to being enamored with their job to the detriment of their personal lives. Since his appearance, Rockhold has claimed to be a victim of some unfavourable editing. Rockhold courted controversy for allegedly asking a date if she ""spits or swallows"", something he vehemently denies. Tim Sylvia was happy with Rockhold's dating show bow, though, hoping it will deflect from his aforementioned appearance on Blind Date. So there's plenty for Chael to mull over ahead of his Celebrity Apprentice appearance. Though, as one of MMA's most intelligent talkers out there, I can't see him being as bland as Tito Ortiz was or talking about fellatio with fellow contestants. Let's hope Sonnen can buck the trend of his colleagues in 2016.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xzdep/a-brief-history-of-mma-fighters-on-reality-tv,Sports,Vice

The support showcases the powerful role the young progressive from New York is playing in steering the Democratic Party.  Sens.

Not every Democrat is a huge fan of the demand for a Green New Deal, however: Pelosi openly mocked Ocasio-Cortez’s legislation Thursday.   “The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?” she told Politico.  The resolution itself does not explicitly lay out the Green New Deal, but urges Congress to take the initiative to define a course of action against climate change. Some of its proposals are sweeping and ambitious, including a call to upgrade “all existing buildings” in the United States and an overhaul of transportation systems. Ocasio-Cortez told NPR News that Democrats actions against the climate threat have thus far not been nearly radical enough.  ""Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world,” she said. “And so while carbon taxes are nice while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. It could be part of a larger solution but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish.""  Ocasio-Cortez is aware that her immense fame has brought her outsized political power for a freshman member of Congress. She wants to help Democrats “rediscover the power of public imagination.” She acknowledged that her critics frequently dismiss her ideas as too big or “impossible” — including the Green New Deal, which is still broadly defined and unfocused — but she pointed to President Donald Trump’s ascension as proof that voters want politicians who back big ideas.  “For him that's his wall,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And obviously I'm diametrically opposed to it, but I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. “I think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what another America looks like."" Supporting the Green New Deal is the latest litmus test for Democratic 2020 aspirants. All five who endorsed the Green New Deal have also endorsed Medicare for All — to varying degrees. Additionally, almost every candidate vying for the 2020 nomination has vowed to reject corporate PAC money — a far-cry from 2016 when eventual nominee Hillary Clinton raked millions upon million in from super PACs. Each candidate has also backed some form of free or debt-free college education. Cover image: U.S. Rep.

950,950,08-02-17 14:10,2017,2,8,Charles Bramesco,Why John Wick rules so hard,"With Hollywood studios force-feeding audiences brand expansions mandated by nothing more than their own bottom line, it’s understandable that we’ve gotten a little dubious of sequels. Responses to the news of a beloved film going franchise tend to range from cautious optimism at best to bafflement and rage at worst. It feels like just yesterday that cries of “Who could have asked for The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature?!” echoed all across America, though it’s possible that may have been just me. It came as a refreshing change of pace, then, when the news that the 2014 Keanu Reeves action vehicle John Wick would get the sequel treatment broke to general rejoicing. Even now, with the much-touted John Wick 2 two days from wide release, the overall mood surrounding the sequel has remained upbeat and eager, bolstered by breathless tweets from early press screenings. JOHN WICK 2 is everything you wanted from a JOHN WICK sequel: gnarly headshots, weird mythology, two hours of non-stop badassery. Holy shit. No wonder; the original John Wick enjoys a sterling critical reputation and an ardent fan base, somehow having achieved cult-object status about 20 minutes into its first showings at public cineplexes. Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key lightly spoofed it with their big-screen vehicle Keanu last year. The fanboy-favorite pop culture outlet Birth Movies Death is currently in the middle of “Wick Week,” a multi-day salute to the new heir apparent to the action-franchise throne. It’s not hard to see what the fuss is about either. John Wick rules. That’s pretty much all that comes to mind when someone asks you to explain the film’s charms: that it hauls all manner of ass. Its pleasures feel self-evident, simple, and immediate. The movie is good because the action is good, easy as that. But while that feeling of simplicity is key to why John Wick works, less apparent factors also figure prominently into its overall appeal. Judiciously curated influences, a perfectly chosen leading man, and elaborate choreography masking its own intricacy all combined to make this film in particular stick in the cultural landscape. John Wick hits with the blunt force of a shotgun blast, but crack open any firearm and you’ll find it houses some deceptively sophisticated mechanisms. As career stuntmen, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch were the ideal men to bring John Wick to life. The co-directors brought years of combat experience to the table when they set out to make John Wick, and like any action junkies worth their salt, they had cultivated an obsession with the tradition known as “gun fu.” As the name suggests, the combat style fuses the hyperkinetic physicality of martial arts with live ammo for one violent yet graceful onslaught. Filmmaker John Woo, a professed influence of Stahelski and Leitch on the film, birthed the gun fu genre during the late 1980s and brought it to prominence with such films as The Killer and Hard Boiled during the early ’90s. Woo turned Hong Kong into the epicenter of a fascinating and highly influential movement in action filmmaking, with his countrymen Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark also conducting mad experiments with death-defying stunts. The distinctive techniques popular in the Hong Kong action style soon caught the attention of filmmakers stateside. The Wachowski siblings ransacked Woo’s cinematic bag of tricks for The Matrix movies (on which Stahelski and Leitch both worked), adding the digital innovation of “bullet time” to the weightless shootouts. It’s all right there in the legendary lobby showdown: the dual-wielding pistols, the indoor sunglasses, the slow-mo wall running. And, ever the magpie, Quentin Tarantino wholesale ganked a handful of shots from The Killer for the bullet-strewn finale of Django Unchained. The gun fu tradition lives on in John Wick’s simultaneously brutal and nimble method of fighting, in which each shot is as precise and purposeful as a jab or kick. Wick doesn’t just shoot the scores of Russian gangsters who cross his path of revenge — he dispatches them. Clad in a black suit that wouldn’t look out of place on Chow Yun-fat, Wick moves with an almost superhuman agility that earns him the title “Baba Yaga” among the gangsters who still revere and fear him. He’s a wuxia warrior by way of Charles Bronson in Death Wish. John Wick screenwriter Derek Kolstad has confessed that he had Paul Newman in mind while drafting the script. But given that Newman’s been dead for some time now, the producers decided to go in a different direction, and it was to the film’s benefit that they did. The role of John Wick plays to Keanu Reeves’s highly specific strengths as an actor. J-Wick’s tense stoicism gelled perfectly with the actor’s dialed-back mode of performance, his restrained anguish a natural pose for Reeves to assume. Though his retaliatory rampage is fueled by the sacred bond between a man and his dog, John Wick presents himself as a remorseless and impersonal force of death. The notion that he’s no mere mortal enhances the shock-and-awe aspect of his bloody campaign (and is reinforced when he takes several shots and appears undeterred), and what’s more, it helped jump-start Reeves’s flagging career. Memories of Reeves from the Matrix set were still clear in Stahelski and Leitch’s minds when they tapped him for the part, and accordingly, they remembered him as he was rather than as what he’d become. The years since Reeves’s turn as blank-slate killing machine Neo had not been particularly kind to him, and his work had substantially thinned out around the start of the 2010s. His IMDb profile was getting clogged with little-seen indies and critical failures, but John Wick got him back on his game. Reeves’s guns-blazing somersault back into his wheelhouse added a cathartic undercurrent to John Wick; it was thrilling to see a skilled professional allowed to get back to doing what he’s best at. The role opened up a world of opportunity for Reeves moving forward, as he has since scored clutch roles in The Neon Demon, the upcoming oddity The Bad Batch, and the fabled next project from Shane Carruth, The Modern Ocean. Keanu’s thinking he’s back, and John Wick gave him one hell of a welcoming party. John Wick excelled by knowing when and how to get out of its own way. The co-directors understood that the fight sequences would be their film’s main selling point, and the script obliged by constructing a story that exists mainly to cue up massive melees. This is where many lesser action films have faltered, unable to ferry their hero from fisticuff to fisticuff without lapsing into implausibility or stupidity. The bare-bones plot of John Wick, however, feels merely unobtrusive rather than thin or ill-formed. We meet John, he gets a rudimentary but sturdy backstory in his dead wife and support pup Daisy, an extremely foolhardy thug kills the pooch, and it’s off to the races. John Wick knew exactly what its audience wanted, and it won them over by giving and giving and giving, with minimal lag time between. The prioritization of spectacle for spectacle’s sake didn’t just shape John Wick’s plot structure; it dictated the visual makeup of the movie as well. The co-directors shoot John Wick’s most extensive whuppings like grand production numbers in one of Hollywood’s opulent old musicals, keeping the focus on the finely detailed blocking above all else. Take the rightly vaunted nightclub scene, in which Wick shoots a charging heavyweight three times in the chest to stop him in his tracks, and then once more in the head to confirm the kill before letting him fall into the pool. It all takes place in roughly one and a half seconds, and the camera stays on Reeves just long enough to catch the move and then follow him through the multilevel facility. Leitch and Stahelski always direct the viewer’s sightline toward an element of motion in the frame — you always keep your eye on the dancer’s feet. The co-directors maximize the impact of their balletic fight routines by privileging the movement of the characters rather than the movement of the camera. They make logical and economical cuts that follow the paths of bodies through space, establishing a coherent visual layout and leading the viewer through it. The nightclub scene is much more involved than one might realize upon first viewing, wending through a half-dozen rooms and hallways across three floors. Break it down shot by shot, and you’ll find that every edit serves to follow the focal point of combat, the usual pattern being the cut from John Wick striking an enemy to the reverse shot of that enemy falling into or out of something. So long as they stay sharp-eyed, viewers won’t miss a single second of the action. It’s the mark of a great film to make what has been intensely labored over feel effortless in its execution. The most seductive quality of John Wick is how easy it makes this all look, as if constructing a brilliant action flick required little more than picking someone cool and setting them loose on an all-out killing spree. Filmmakers rarely stumble into excellence, however. Stahelski and Leitch calculated each and every move, synthesized influences with their personal artistic style, and in doing so they pulled off some dizzyingly complex set pieces. It was no minor feat to elevate the act of totally owning into a refined art form.",https://www.vox.com/2017/2/8/14487112/john-wick-rules,,Vox

954,954,17-05-19 21:40,2019,5,17,Rani Molla,President Trump’s new immigration proposal would be terrible for tech ,"President Donald Trump’s “merit-based” immigration proposal is never going to happen. But what it does do is try and cover up the fact that his administration has systematically thwarted high-skilled immigrants and the tech companies trying to employ them. Using executive orders, the president has made it more difficult — and expensive — to hire high-skilled tech workers from other countries. The administration has throttled a program that encouraged entrepreneurs to come to the US. It’s also ending work permits for spouses of H-1B holders, who are often highly skilled professionals themselves, among other measures to stop immigration. One result has been a net decline in high-skilled visas, known as H-1Bs, which has been bad for tech companies in the US (but good for Canada). In a Rose Garden speech yesterday, Trump proposed a plan that sounded like it would be good for tech. He suggested replacing green cards for US citizens’ siblings, parents, and adult children — as well as permanent residents’ spouses and children, among others — with visas for workers, especially high-skilled ones. Using a merit-based point system, the proposal would favor people with “extraordinary talent,” “professional and specialized vocations,” and “exceptional academic track records.” The overall number of issuances would remain the same at 1.1 million. Of all green cards, these so-called “Build America” visas would capture 57 percent for people in the employment and skill category, plus 33 percent for immediate family, and 10 percent to humanitarian causes, according to the White House fact sheet, which is otherwise rather sparse on details. Currently, the majority of green cards are issued to families of US citizens. Using what information the White House did provide as well as existing immigration data, Boundless Immigration, a venture-backed company that helps people navigate the US immigration system, took an educated guess as to how the proposal would shift green card issuance: While at first this may seem good for tech — an industry experiencing cutthroat competition for the limited number of US tech workers — it’s completely unrealistic. You can’t expect people to move and work here without the hope of bringing their families with them. It’s also insulting that the White House is only paying lip service to high-skilled workers and their families. People coming to work in the US — who aid American companies and generally benefit the overall economy — are entitled to live full lives. For many immigrants (not to mention, people in general) these lives include their families. These relationships also contribute to integration and child care, assets not easily quantified in dollars and cents. “They’re hiding the fact that that’s a huge downside by trying to create a dichotomy between supposedly low-skill, low-paid, family immigrants and high-tech, high-wage, not-jobs-stealing, merit-based immigrants,” Doug Rand, a Boundless co-founder, told Recode. “The fact is everyone has family.” Not allowing high-skilled tech immigrants to bring their families would inhibit workers’ willingness to accept jobs here. They can work elsewhere. Indeed, tech immigrants are increasingly choosing to take jobs in Canada, where the immigration policy is more liberal. Still, there are enough people who want to immigrate to the US that the 1.1 millions spots would be filled even if this dead-on-arrival proposal did happen, according to David Bier, a policy analyst at Cato Institute who specializes in immigration. “You’re just going to have a different type of person who wants to come here as a consequence of restriction on family sponsorships,” Bier said.

955,955,30-01-19 00:00,2019,1,30,,Factbox: Tariff wars - duties imposed by Trump and U.S. trading partners,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has rattled the world trade order by imposing unilateral tariffs to combat what he calls unfair trade practices by China, the European Union and other major trading partners of the United States.  The actions led to tit-for-tat retaliation, including a tariff war with China that Washington and Beijing are trying find a way out of in talks this week. Here is a rundown of major U.S. tariff actions and retaliatory measures in the past year.  - 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent tariffs on imported aluminum, imposed on March 23 on national security grounds. Exemptions have been granted to Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea in exchange for quotas, and negotiations over quotas continue with Canada, Mexico and the European Union.  - 20 percent to 50 percent tariffs on imported washing machines, imposed Jan. 22 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Whirlpool Corp and GE Appliances, a unit of China’s Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd  - 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels, imposed Jan. 22 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Solar World , based in Germany, and Suniva, owned by China’s Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd  - Trump is considering tariffs of around 25 percent on imported cars and auto parts, based on a U.S. Commerce Department study of whether such imports threaten U.S. national security.  The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal protects Canadian and Mexican production in the event of such tariffs through a quota system. Trump has pledged not to impose auto tariffs on Japan and the European Union while trade negotiations with those partners are underway.  - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese technology goods including machinery, semiconductors, autos, aircraft parts and intermediate electronics components imposed July 6 and Aug. 23 as part of “Section 301” probe into China’s intellectual property practices.  - 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods including chemicals, building materials, furniture and some consumer electronics, imposed Sept. 24 as a response to Chinese retaliation. The levy on these imports is scheduled to increase to 25 percent on March 2 if negotiations between the United States and China fail to produce a deal to resolve their trade dispute.  - If an agreement with China cannot be reached, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese goods, representing all remaining imports from China, including cell phones, computers, clothing, footwear and other consumer products.  - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday that Trump has directed him to pursue all tools to raise the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese autos to the 40 percent that China is now charging on cars and trucks built in the United States. The United States charges 27.5 percent tariffs on Chinese vehicles.  - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood, vegetables, whiskey, ethanol, imposed July 6 and Aug. 23 in retaliation for initial rounds of U.S. tariffs. China has suspended a 25 percent duty on U.S. auto imports during their trade negotiations. Beijing has resumed some purchases of U.S. soybeans but has not formally suspended those tariffs.  - Tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients, imposed Sept. 24.  - Based on 2017 U.S. Census Bureau trade data, China only would have about $20 billion in U.S. imports left to levy in retaliation for any future U.S. tariffs, of which $16 billion were commercial aircraft, largely built by Boeing Co. Retaliation could come in other forms, such as increased regulatory hurdles for U.S. companies doing business in China.  - Canada on July 1 imposed tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, coffee, ketchup and bourbon whiskey in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.  - Mexico on June 5 imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on American steel, pork, cheese, apples, potatoes and bourbon, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Mexican metals.  - The European Union on June 22 imposed import duties of 25 percent on a $2.8 billion range of imports from the United States in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. Targeted U.S. products include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, peanuts, blue jeans, steel and aluminum.  - India, the world’s biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, on June 21 raised import duties on the nuts by 20 percent and increased tariffs on a range of other farm products and U.S. iron and steel, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Indian steel.

956,956,06-03-19 14:40,2019,3,6,Kelsey Piper,The case for “Band-Aid” philanthropy,"If you’re working on directly solving a problem faced by poor people, you’ve almost certainly heard it at least once: Helping people is a “Band-Aid” solution. Here’s the argument: Most problems like poverty, disease, hunger, and war won’t be permanently fixed by homeless shelters, private donations, or other small-scale projects. We need bigger changes to the system to really solve them. That’s true as far as it goes. But it’s a short leap from concluding that shelters and bednets to prevent malaria are just “Band-Aids” to concluding that philanthropists should stop wasting their time on the “Band-Aid” solutions in front of them, and should instead focus their energy on big bets that might, if they pan out, solve the problem entirely. In the spring edition of the Stanford Social Innovation Review, David Callahan, the founder of Inside Philanthropy, pushes back on that view, and points out some of the tragic consequences of its newfound popularity: A dominant message within elite philanthropy right now is that smart funders should not waste their money on Band-Aid solutions that are applied downstream. Instead, they must search for opportunities upstream to make breakthroughs in attacking systemic problems. These days, to pursue significant influence as a major-league philanthropist—and win accolades—you are supposed to be on a ceaseless quest for innovative and scalable solutions to society’s toughest challenges. I share Callahan’s hesitations about this. There are a bunch of problems with dismissing simple, known solutions as mere “Band-Aids” and elevating big bets as the more meaningful way to do philanthropy. One is that if you don’t know what you’re doing, most of your big bets will be bad bets. To be sure, philanthropists really can do a lot of good by looking for high-risk opportunities with the potential for outsize returns. And there’s an argument that those high-risk opportunities are the perfect fit for philanthropy, since there aren’t any other institutions in modern civil society that fund them. But unlikely efforts to solve the problem at the source can do worse than be a waste of money — they can actively do harm, if you were wrong about what the problem is. Systemic change might be needed to solve societal problems, but that doesn’t make arbitrary attempts to change systems likely to have good effects. Effective giving in uncertain arenas like policy change might best be thought of as a hard problem for foundations to approach once they’ve already gotten very good at what they do. Another problem, Callahan observes, is that the search for innovative, clever grant opportunities is causing philanthropists to give less money overall. That’s because these innovative grants are often to small-scale programs that can absorb a few million dollars in funding, but not a few billion. The boring “Band-Aid” forms of aid, by contrast — think vaccination programs, cash transfers, bednets — could put hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions, in additional funding to use. “The high value placed on novel and ambitious programs may be slowing down the pace at which today’s new mega-givers are disposing of their fortunes,” Callahan writes. “When donors do identify true innovators — say, some overlooked nonprofit that has found the magic formula for licking this or that social ill — chances are that they will be unprepared to absorb an eight- or nine-figure gift.” How’d we end up obsessed with higher-risk, high-reward giving in the first place? There seems to have been a definite shift in that direction over the past few years, partially driven by new foundations entering the field and wanting to make their mark, and partially driven by strong arguments. Interestingly, the transition to a more “bets”-oriented philosophy of giving was probably a very good thing for philanthropy. Foundations tend to expect each of their grants to produce results, and they’ll naturally be hesitant to make grants that have only a small chance of panning out. If a project looks uncertain, won’t have returns for a long time, or is overwhelmingly likely to be a bust, then it wouldn’t typically get funded — even if it’s impactful enough to make the long shot worth it. In recent years, there have been some changes in how major foundations consider these questions. In 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project published “Hits-Based Giving,” an argument that philanthropists should accept more risk because many of the giving opportunities with the highest expected value would be ones that were unlikely to pan out. “Much of the best philanthropy is likely to fail,” the organization’s founder argued. “We suspect that high-risk, high-reward philanthropy could be described as a ‘hits business,’ where a small number of enormous successes account for a large share of the total impact — and compensate for a large number of failed projects.” And indeed, the charitable world seems to have gotten friendlier to the idea that philanthropists should be more risk-oriented and more willing to make grants that might not have immediate or certain impact. Fourteen articles in this month’s Stanford Social Innovation Review tackle the question of how to think about big bets, from profiles of promising projects to questions about how the structure of large foundations makes it hard to take risks. On the whole, the fact that the philanthropy world is now, as Callahan puts it, “on a ceaseless quest for innovative and scalable solutions” is a good thing — it means there’s more room to make big, uncertain, and important things happen. But what Callahan is pointing out is that this shift in priorities had a cost — a growing sense, at least among some philanthropists, that the only cool, innovative, or valuable projects are the “big bets,” that merely saving lives with global health interventions is somehow outmoded. And that might be making many philanthropists less willing to invest in proven, cost-effective ways to do good. There’s a deeper point here. While we should of course stay on the lookout for opportunities that are even more cost-effective, thinking of programs like bednet distribution, vaccination programs, and parasite treatments as “Band-Aids” seems to reflect an unhealthy perspective. For a family living in a country with endemic malaria, one of the problems they face is that they don’t have the means to keep their family safe from malaria. Bednets aren’t a “Band-Aid” for that family but a solution to their problem. Recipients of cash transfers in developing countries use them to build houses, get out of debt, get medical attention, and start businesses. They have problems like homelessness and debt, and the money is not a Band-Aid for those problems. It’s a solution. Aid like this only starts to seem like a “Band-Aid” if we think of the problems as “malaria” instead of “families unprotected from malaria tonight”; as “poverty” instead of “kids sleeping under a leaky roof because their parents can’t afford the repairs.” When you zoom in and remember why we care about poverty and malaria in the first place — because of the individual people whose lives are affected, this morning, this evening, tomorrow — then “Band-Aid” ceases to really apply.

957,957,16-02-19 00:00,2019,2,16,"Sarah N. Lynch, Nathan Layne",Mueller seeks tough sentence for ex-Trump campaign chairman Manafort,"(Reuters) - Prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller urged a federal judge in Virginia on Friday to impose a strict prison sentence for President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, after a jury last year convicted him on eight counts of bank and tax fraud.  In their sentencing memo filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, prosecutors said Manafort, who is 69, deserves between 19.6 and 24.4 years in prison and a fine of between $50,000 and $24 million.  “While some of these offenses are commonly prosecuted, there was nothing ordinary about the millions of dollars involved in the defendant’s crimes, the duration of his criminal conduct or the sophistication of his schemes,” prosecutors said in the memo.  “Manafort did not commit these crimes out of necessity or hardship,” they said. “He was well-educated, professionally successful and financially well off. He nonetheless cheated the United States Treasury and the public out of more than $6 million in taxes at a time when he had substantial resources.”  Friday’s court filing in Virginia came just days after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Manafort had breached his plea agreement in a parallel case by lying to investigators despite a pledge to cooperate.  That finding earlier this week by Judge Amy Berman Jackson in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia could have a direct impact on how Manafort is sentenced in the Virginia case.   Judge T.S. Ellis in Alexandria, Virginia, had planned to sentence Manafort on Feb. 8, but he later postponed that until after Jackson’s ruling, saying it “may have some effect on the sentencing decision in this case.”  Manafort was one of the first people in Trump’s orbit to face criminal charges as part of Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the 2016 presidential election in his favor.  Trump has denied colluding and called the probe a witch hunt, while Russia has denied meddling in the election.  None of the charges Manafort faced related directly to Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.  In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused Manafort of hiding from U.S. tax authorities $16 million he earned as a political consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, money he used to fund an opulent lifestyle.   Later, when his lobbying work started to dry up following the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, prosecutors said Manafort began lying to banks to secure $20 million in loans to keep his lifestyle afloat.  After almost four days of deliberations, a 12-member jury found Manafort guilty on two counts of bank fraud, five counts of tax fraud and one charge of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.  In September, Manafort pleaded guilty in a parallel case in Washington to attempted witness tapering and conspiring against the United States, a charge that covers conduct including money laundering and unregistered lobbying.  As part of that deal, he pledged to cooperate with the Justice Department. However, prosecutors later said they had caught Manafort in several lies and wanted to tear up the agreement in a move that could cause him to face a much stiffer prison sentence.  Earlier this week, Jackson ruled there was a “preponderance” of evidence that Manafort lied on three different topics, including his communications with his former business partner Konstantin Kilimnik, who prosecutors say has ties to Russian intelligence and helped Manafort try to obstruct justice. Kilimnik has denied such ties.  Specifically, Jackson found that Manafort lied about his interactions with Kilimnik including about the sharing of polling data on the Trump campaign and their discussions over a “Ukrainian peace plan,” a proposal that envisioned ending U.S. sanctions on Russia - long an important objective of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government.  Prosecutors have said these lies are “at the heart” of their investigation into potential collusion, according to a transcript released last week.

960,960,25-05-19 00:00,2019,5,25,,China says U.S. demand on its state-owned enterprises is 'invasion' on economic sovereignty,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States has called on China to curb the development of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a demand that China sees as an “invasion” on its economic sovereignty, Chinese state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday.  Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply earlier this month after the Trump administration accused China of having “reneged” on its previous promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.   Washington later slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate.  As trade talks stalled, both sides have appeared to be digging in. China has denied it had walked back on its promises but reiterated it would not make concessions to “matters of principles” to defend its core interests, although no full details were given.   “At the negotiating table, the U.S. government presented a number of arrogant demands to China, including restricting the development of state-owned enterprises,” Xinhua said in a commentary.  SOEs in China enjoy not only explicit subsidies but also hidden benefits such as implicit government guarantees for debts and lower interest for bank loans, analysts and trade groups say.  “Obviously, this is beyond the scope of trade negotiations and touches on China’s fundamental economic system,” Xinhua said.  “This shows that behind the United States’ trade war against China, it is trying to invade China’s economic sovereignty and force China to damage its core interests.”  The commentary added the United States has made unfounded accusations including that Beijing had forced technology transfers from foreign firms operating in China, saying this is all evidence that the U.S side is “forcing China to change its development path.”   Reporting by Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo; Editing by Frances Kerry",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/china-says-u-s-demand-on-its-state-owned-enterprises-is-invasion-on-economic-sovereignty-idUSKCN1SV0I7,Business News,Reuters
961,961,07-06-16 13:17,2016,6,7,John Saward,Muhammad Ali Taught Us All the Virtue of Arrogance,"Muhammad Ali is dead, and all I can think about are the violent men he told the world he wasn't afraid of. I'm watching When We Were Kings, the 1996 documentary about the famous Don King–promoted battle between Ali and George Foreman in Zaire, an African warlord, and America's obsession with old men fighting young men. It's 1974. George Foreman is 25 years old. He's training at the presidential palace in Zaire, and the heavy bag he's hitting sounds like it's not going to make it. Foreman smashes the bag again and again—smooth, identical swings, the same spot each time, the bag starting to cave in. Foreman's face never changes. Fifteen minutes of this. When he's done, next to him, skinny men in sunglasses fold their arms and laugh, watching the bag sway, looking like a piece of fruit with a chunk bitten out of it.  I think about Ali, and I think of that moment, Foreman and the piles of pulverized human beings he left behind him, Ali knowing all this, deciding on a strategy where he'll stand in front of Foreman and get beat to ruins just like the bag, waiting, waiting.  Later in the film now. The sports broadcaster Howard Cosell has recorded a news segment. Close-up shot. No one else on screen. Cosell in his trademark ABC Sports yellow blazer, hairpiece shiny like melted candle wax. His sentences halt in strange spots, like he's relaying news of a tragedy. ""The time may have come, to say goodbye, to Muhammad Ali."" Behind Cosell, tree leaves move in the breeze. He speaks like a man has already died, like there's a casket just out of frame with Ali's maimed corpse inside. ""Maybe he can pull off a miracle. But against George Foreman... it's hard for me to conjure with that.""  George Foreman boxed like the birthday boy going after the piñata, wild and hungry and relentless. He once hit Joe Frazier so hard with a right hook that Frazier's feet came off the ground. Pause and watch what he does to Jose Roman: Closer to the fight, Ali is in a gym, jumping rope shirtless, shouting at the ground. ""HE'S SCARED TO DEATH, HE'S SCARED TO DEATH, HE'S MEETING HIS MASTER, HIS TEACHER, HIS IDOL.""  Ali saw a tsunami coming and built a sandcastle.  When you watch him in the ring, it seems at moments like his movements were imprecise, arms dangling like wind chimes, exhausted, staggering, bent backward at the waist, like lifting body parts was too tiresome a task to invest in completely. But then you notice something, the other guy gets close and Ali has adjusted millimeters to one side, then the other, the other guy keeps coming, still nothing. It seems so simple! It's like trying to press the same sides of two magnets together. So simple, and yet, and yet. Ali moves backward, into the ropes, and then his course changes almost imperceptibly, a bounce or lunge, he's in the other guy's space now, he's turned a retreat into an ambush while the whole town is sleeping, and then other guy's on the ground, the fight is over, they're chanting Ali's name, and the other guy's alone in the corner trying to make out the faces of the people in front of him.  Ali was a scientist of ring dimensions, of human biology, angles and physics and punch velocities, the limits of someone's stamina, understanding when a body is starting to fail. He leaned against the ropes until Foreman went mad, and then Ali turned it on him.  In all contexts, this was his philosophy: behind podiums, or wading through mobs with microphones stuffed against his cheeks, or outdoors, before corrupt dictators, everywhere, he wanted to provoke until he exposed you as weak-willed, fraudulent, insecure, and reckless. Ali knew a certain irrefutable truth about masculinity: Make a man look agitated, make him look in the mirror and contemplate his worthiness? You already have him.  He once told Roger Ebert, ""A good trainer knows a good fighter can't stand to have people talk about him bad on television.""  A few days before Ali fights Foreman, Ali is hopping and shadowboxing in the middle of a long, straight road in Africa. The sun is starting to set, two cars are stopped behind him with their lights on, a dozen people are watching, standing still. Ali is breathing heavy, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt but not a drop of sweat on his face. He's talking into the camera, but he's talking to Foreman: ""Sucker you ain't nothing. You too ugly to represent us colored folks.""  Foreman hit 32-year-old Muhammad Ali for eight rounds, and then Ali leaned on Foreman and whispered in Foreman's ear, ""George, is that all you got?"" Then Ali punched him in the face, and it was done.  Ali, to quote Mike Tyson, ""was the meanest fighter of all time."" He could be beaten, but when he beat you, he left you existentially devastated, like Foreman lived after Zaire, a man left to wander the earth.  You could argue that there were better fighters, but none with a better sense of their powers, none who seemed to get more diabolical satisfaction from using them. Look at Tyson, coming unraveled like he was permanently alive in the middle of a fever dream. Or Floyd Mayweather, whose methods are so joylessly calculated you could imagine him laminating copies of his ATM receipts and passing them out like prayer cards. Ali always seemed like a menace and a monk simultaneously. Here's a moment, from some time around 1974. Ali is in a studio, on a stool in the middle of a pretend boxing ring. The audience is asking him questions. A middle-aged white woman tells him she doesn't like his arrogance. She says she's a minority in America, too, because she's from England, and she doesn't act this way.  Ali says this: ""You white. You can go anywhere in this city you wanna go. You can go to town, move into neighborhoods, buy things, you can open a business downtown Chicago... and I can't, but you from England! You got some nerve to get mad at me because I'm proud, and I want to fight and be confident and get my people to be proud... We been the minority for four hundred years; you freer than me, and you're from England.""  She tries to say no, but it's no use, the crowd's applause has already blown her away.  Ali's great ability was to antagonize, to infuriate; proof of a man's ability to alter the tone of a moment all by himself. To make Foreman come unhinged, to reduce an audience or a nation to haters sputtering with anger, to incite something, and then stand back and watch people reveal themselves. He is the idea that you can be the most delusional version of yourself, and no one can stop you, as long as you win. He seemed driven not by impulse or rage but by a need to disrupt and embarrass. Arrogance is not toxic; it is just brilliance + a vendetta. ""Arrogance"" is a word used by people who've had their own smallness magnified by the presence of something large. It is hypnotizing to watch a man who has acknowledged your rules, your steadfast obedience to them, and who then tells those rules he does not care about them.  The only Ali I saw growing up was silent, fragile, a figure to wince at, thick sunglasses, someone next to him holding his arm. I only saw Real Ali when he was being used as montage fodder, a signifier of either defiance, playfulness, resilience, or victory, depending on whether I was being sold a sports drinks, life insurance, or a new ESPN network. His life was sanded down until all that remained were the theatrics and slow-motion. Biography, though, is always more complicated than montage.  His religious and political views fluctuated from radical to pragmatic to sympathetic to diplomatic. He could seem gracious and docile, sitting next to Joe Namath delivering sanitary anecdotes about fighting Joe Frazier in a cemetery if he had to. And then, surrounded by college students who called him a traitor for refusing to be drafted, he could unleash scorching, unpunctuated sermons about racial hypocrisy and the myths of patriotism.  He preached kindness but viciously degraded Joe Frazier. He claimed to be a family man but carried on affairs throughout most of his life. He said of women in 1977, ""These independent women that don't have any children, they get weak and sickly. Look at [his children's nanny] Miss Elly. Fifty‐eight grandchildren, and strong as a horse. Stand up Miss Elly. Lots of babies—breast fed—that's what women need."" He spoke against the races mixing. He spoke about the need for religious tolerance.  We want unambiguous superheroes, easy obituaries, stories with tidy morals. But he also said this, just after changing his name from Cassius Clay: ""I don't have to be who you want me to be. I'm free to be who I want."" This, for all his contradictions, all his defects, was a truth. This is why some men get only memes and others get their faces on the walls of freshman dorms. Ali was impenetrable. He was unshakable. He could hit us, he could move us, but we could never get our hands on him.

965,965,09-12-17 20:36,2017,12,9,Carli Velocci,'Alita: Battle Angel' Doesn't Understand Why Anime Characters Have Big Eyes,"People were made pretty uncomfortable this week after the first trailer for Alita: Battle Angel hit the web. It’s directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Sin City) and produced by James Cameron, so a distinct visual style is a give-in. However, the trailer showed off a style that gave viewers a weird sense of the uncanny valley, mainly in Alita’s large, unnatural anime eyes.  We haven’t seen the movie yet, so we can’t fully comment on whether the eye choice has any merit, but from the trailer we can speculate a few things. For one, while there are other robots shown, none of them have oversized eyes. Secondly, while the cast is multicultural, there is little that ties into the manga’s Japanese origins.  So why give Alita what are known as “anime eyes?” It’s a strange choice not just because it looks uncanny, but because the movie doesn’t seem to understand  why manga and anime use them. Article continues below.  The interesting thing is that on its surface, anime eyes aren’t too different than the ones used in American cartoons. That’s because a lot of early manga was influenced by Western animation styles. Japan has a long history of isolationism, which I’m not going to get into here, but with the arrival of Western civilizations came the proliferation of Western culture in the East. Japan was churning out animation in the early parts of the 20th century and into World War II, where some of the earliest examples of “anime” were used as propaganda.  After the war, however, Japan experienced a great economic boom, which included a pop culture explosion. This was thanks in part to the American occupation of the country after 1945, but also because of a postwar fatigue. According to William M. Tsutsui, from the Association for Asian Studies, post-war Japan just wanted to have some fun, writing “a tired, dispirited, and generally impoverished populace sought mass entertainment as an escape from the challenges of everyday life.  However, the distinct anime style as we know it today can be traced back largely to one person. Osamu Tezuka, widely considered to be the “godfather of manga,” was heavily influenced by Walt Disney and Max Fleischer, the creator of Betty Boop. He was said to have been particularly obsessed with Bambi, which he watched over 80 times. If you even just glance at Betty or early Disney characters like Bambi, you can see the resemblance with anime. Both feature characters with oversized heads and large, expressive eyes.   Tezuka went on to create the precursor for modern-day anime:  Astro Boy, the story of an android that fights crime. The main character is the epitome of this art style, with large, expressive eyes that carried over to his multiple incarnations. It debuted in 1963 in Japan and has been recreated multiple times since.  Anime eyes have evolved over the past half-century, with certain rules being assigned to different sizes. Large eyes are normally assigned to female characters, since they are depicted as being more expressive. Similarly, stories that are set to reach a largely female demographic or a younger one also tend to feature characters with larger eyes, whether they’re male or female. Anime or manga that are more action-oriented, dramatic, or edgy tend to feature characters with narrower eyes, although women characters are still drawn with slightly larger eyes. Villains are also normally drawn with narrower eyes.  Japan latched onto this style partially as a natural byproduct of American occupation and influence, but also as a way to market Western material back at the source. Japanese history wasn’t washed away by Americanization. In fact, the combining of the two resulted in a distinctly original style and economy. For example, there wasn’t enough metal in Japan post-World War II, so tin cans and other scrap were used to make recreations of American Jeeps, which became incredibly popular.  However, the cutesy anime style was also the result of a marketing tool. Old Japanese art features characters that  looked Japanese, while postwar art went for something more neutral. After all, it was Western civilizations that turned the Japanese look into a caricature, used in propaganda material during the war. According to Emily Yoshida at the Verge, “After the war, once the Japanese face had become synonymous in the western imagination with untrustworthiness and cruelty, toymakers, character empires… adopted a more benign countenance.” Above: The trailer for the Battle Angel Alita anime. So the  Battle Angel Alita manga, first published in 1990, is a byproduct of decades of Japan creating its own unique art style and media. There’s nothing visually distinguishable about Alita as a character. Her large eyes aren’t special, nor are they a product of her robotic nature in the manga. They’re an artistic choice that puts her squarely in a decades-long tradition, that makes the  Alita story distinctly Japanese and distinctly anime.  Nowhere in  Alita does the character’s large anime eyes signify her cyborg status since other characters have the same features. However, in this movie she seems to be the only one. But why? Why has Rodriguez and the rest of the creators decided on this choice? From the trailer, we can guess that it’s another way to “other” Alita from the rest of the characters, who are all played by real actors with few changes to their actual faces. She’s not the only robot in the story, yet aspects of her appearance -- from her robotic limbs to her eyes -- are what signify her as different from the rest.  From what we can gather, it looks less like her uncomfortable anime eyes will have a significance, but that they were put there just to signify that the movie is inspired by manga. It signals to the audience “yes this is Japanese and yes we’re not going to try and erase the source material.”   Yet that’s what they’re doing. Alita’s eyes are the only thing that is distinctly Japanese about the movie, which features no main Japanese actors or characters.  Battle Angel Alita takes place in a dystopian future America, so there’s no in-story reason why the characters would need to be Japanese, but they’re named as such in the comic. Like  Ghost in the Shell, another recent Americanized live-action anime adaptation, the characteristics are there without any awareness of why they are.   Alita looks to be going down the same path as  Ghost in the Shell, not only in its whitewashed nature but in how fails to realize where the art came from in the first place.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kpdew/alita-battle-angel-doesnt-understand-why-anime-characters-have-big-eyes,Games,Vice

It would also mean a significant tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. These tax figures are important for understanding why Republicans are so committed to Obamacare repeal. It’s not just about delivering on a campaign promise to get rid of President Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment. It’s also about providing a significant tax cut to the top 1 percent of earners. The Affordable Care Act includes many new taxes, often levied on the highest-income Americans to help finance the expansion of health coverage for lower-income citizens. This includes a 3.8 percent tax on investment income over a certain threshold, as well as additional payroll taxes on high earners. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan nonprofit based in Washington that provides analysis of tax issues in policy, finds in a new report that the net effect of Obamacare repeal is a massive tax cut for the rich. TPC estimates that the top 1 percent of earners would get an average tax cut of $33,000 if Obamacare is repealed — and those in the top 0.1 percent would get an average tax cut of $197,000. Meanwhile, those who earn less would actually see their taxes, on average, go up. This is because most of the tax subsidies to purchase insurance coverage through the marketplace go to low-income Americans. TPC estimates that, on average, Americans who are in the bottom quarter of earners would see their taxes increase by $90. This, as TPC notes, masks a lot of variation. “Most low-income households would see no change at all in their taxes,” TPC’s Howard Gleckman writes. “But about 7 percent would get a tax cut of about $1,200 on average while 4 percent would face a very big tax hike, averaging nearly $3,900 — mostly because they’d lose the benefit of the premium subsidies.” This chart from TPC shows how average incomes would change under ACA repeal. You can see that incomes for low-income Americans (the left half of the chart) go down slightly, while incomes for high-income Americans go up pretty significantly as they face fewer taxes.

Read more: The GOP has a marijuana problem only Trump can fix Most of the action so far has been in the House. A bipartisan group of 69 lawmakers sent House leaders a letter Friday, asking them to strengthen a federal budget rider that prevents federal agencies like the DOJ from spending money on prosecuting medical marijuana.  The ask: expand it to cover the eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana, too. “While the federal government is legitimately empowered to regulate interstate commerce, the measures adopted by states such as California, Oregon, and Colorado are aimed solely at intrastate commerce and as such should not be interfered with,” the letter reads. A day before, California Rep. Barbara Lee, a Democrat, alongside four co-sponsors, went even further. They want the same restrictions on the federal government, only enshrined as standalone U.S. law. “Taxpayer dollars should not be used to crack down on law-abiding taxpayers operating legally in states,” Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat sponsoring the bill, told Marijuana Moment.  Read more: A stoner's guide to marijuana policy under Jeff Sessions Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, also defended her state’s marijuana laws Friday, speaking to local media.  “This is a matter of states' rights,” she said. “Nevada voters, as well as voters across this country and other states, have voted for the right to either have medical marijuana, or in our case, it’s also recreational marijuana.” Things have also been heating up in the Senate. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has said she’s working with a bipartisan group to introduce legislation similar to the proposals working their way through the House, while Colorado Republican Corey Gardner has said he will hold up Trump’s nominees for U.S. Attorney in protest of the policy changes. “I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation,” Gardner said in a Jan. 4 statement. “In 2016, President Trump said marijuana legalization should be left up to the states and I agree.” The Justice Department, meanwhile, has remained firm about its stance on the issue. Speaking to a forum Jan. 5, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pushed back against marijuana advocates. “For us it is a rule of law issue,” Rosenstein said. “The facts are that the U.S. Congress has decreed marijuana is unlawful throughout these United States of America, every one of the 50 states, and no state or local government has the authority to overrule federal law.”  The Justice Department declined to comment. The Congressional pressure joins recent efforts from states like New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Vermont, which are moving towards legalizing and protecting recreational marijuana in spite of the federal government's new stance.

The movie opens in Phnom Penh on April 15, 1975, showing the everyday life of the city right before the Khmer Rouge took power. Our viewpoint characters are Chou (based on Do’s mother, voiced by Berenice Bejo), Khuon (Louis Garrel), and their family, including their four-year-old son Sovanh. Young, happy, and in love, their peaceful life is upended within moments. After one cut, their home and the streets of the city are empty, save for a few soldiers. The people are exiled and made to march outward, the communists proclaiming that they’re being saved from their impure capitalist lives. During their long journey, Sovanh is separated from his parents and ends up being placed in a different camp. Chou and Khuon become determined to survive and make their family whole again. Though based on one of the greatest human rights tragedies of the past century, Funan mostly keeps explicit violence away from the audience. The one exception comes toward the end of the film, magnifying its impact. Do does not allow the hardships his mother and millions more endured to fall into sensationalism. That doesn’t mean we are completely spared from witnessing the atrocities. People left out in the rain are given a pitiful amount of food to eat. Sovanh sees a trio of men tied together, guns to their backs, as a grave is being prepared for them. Chou’s body wastes away over years of abuse and starvation. The film’s sound design emphasizes every tired step, desperate breath, every gun cocked and bullet fired. Much like how Isao Takahata depicted Japan in the closing days and aftermath of World War II in his 1988 classic Grave of the Fireflies, Do uses animation to come to an understanding of a dark time in history. He does so without being didactic, and also refrains from making an easy “us vs. them” story. While Chou is the hero, we see her become hardened and cold, even lashing out at her husband for saving a Khmer soldier’s life. The soldiers could easily have been depicted as monolithic heartless monsters, but instead we often see where their humanity pierces their ideology. The film’s background art by Michael Crouzat is at times quite stunning, forming a distinct contrast with the bleak events of the story. There are moments when Do pulls back so that we can see the scope of an event, but also take notice of Cambodia’s natural beauty. The film’s character design, while simple, serves to emphasize that while the Khmer members are a shade or two darker than Chou and the rest of the prisoners, they don’t look that dissimilar. No matter what side of the divide any person was on during this time, they were all of the same land, the same people. In Funan, Do demonstrates not just an appreciation of the kind of stories animation can tell, but also an understanding of how people can hold onto their humanity even in the most dire of circumstances. Even though we could have every reason to hate or mistrust someone, when we see a person in need, the most human thing we can do is offer a helping hand. This film is a beautiful and moving tribute not just to Do’s mother, but also to Cambodia and its people. Funan continues in screenings at select theaters nationwide this summer.",https://hyperallergic.com/507633/funan-denis-do-review/,,Hyperallergic
972,972,26-06-18 15:06,2018,6,26,Dylan Scott,Read: Supreme Court decision in California abortion case,"The Supreme Court sided with abortion opponents on Tuesday over abortion rights supporters in an important case centered on “crisis pregnancy centers.” The Court’s five conservative justices ruled that a California law that requires those centers — which do not provide abortions and often oppose it on religious grounds — to inform their patients that free or low-cost abortions would be available to them elsewhere likely violates the centers’ First Amendment rights. The law also requires centers that do not have a state medical license to disclose that fact, which the court also ruled was likely a violation of their constitutional protections. The decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, sent the case back down to the lower courts for further proceedings. The four liberal justices dissented from the Court’s ruling, led by Justice Stephen Breyer. Thomas wrote that the California law placed an undue burden on the centers’ free speech rights and that the law was not protected by Court precedents that do allow states to set some disclosure requirements for factual, non-controversial information. “California’s notice requires covered clinics to disclose information about state-sponsored services — including abortion, hardly an ‘uncontroversial’ topic,” Thomas wrote in his ruling. There is one interesting byproduct of the Court’s decision, though. Republican-led states have increasingly set strict requirements for what doctors must tell a woman before they perform an abortion. Those state laws have been challenged but upheld over the question of whether they restrict a woman’s right to abortion. Now, however, it is possible that those laws could be challenged on a First Amendment basis, arguing that such requirements violate the doctors’ free speech rights. As Eric Citron, a Harvard Law School lecturer who has clerked for two Supreme Court justices, wrote on SCOTUSblog after the ruling: One interesting dynamic in this case is that many states have laws telling abortion providers what they need to say to women seeking abortions. Those laws have been challenged as undue burdens on the right to obtain an abortion — and, as Breyer points out, have been upheld since Casey. But they haven’t been challenged under the kind of First Amendment theory developed here. In the long run, the ruling here may limit states’ ability to force doctors to provide certain kinds of information.

973,973,19-10-18 00:00,2018,10,19,Tom Miles,Clash over Trump tariffs heats up with barrage of WTO litigation,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Disputes over U.S. tariffs and retaliatory moves by other states have sparked 12 requests for adjudication at the World Trade Organization, signalling an escalation in global trade tensions.   The agenda for an Oct. 29 meeting of the WTO’s dispute settlement body on Friday confirmed the legal moves, which Reuters reported late on Thursday.  The dispute procedure begins with a 60-day window for talks to try to reach a settlement. The meeting agenda show that those talks have failed.   By asking for adjudication, the disputants are triggering litigation that could last years.   China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Russia and Turkey have all requested that the WTO set up a panel of adjudicators to judge the legality of steel and aluminium tariffs which U.S. President Donald Trump imposed in March.   In return, the United States has asked the WTO to adjudicate on tariffs imposed by Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union in response to those U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs.  It has also asked for adjudication in a separate case against China. Washington wants to impose tariffs on Beijing for its alleged failure to protect U.S. intellectual property rights.  Opponents of the 25 percent U.S. duty on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium say they breach WTO rules. Washington says they are a national security matter, and therefore outside the WTO’s jurisdiction.   The wheels of WTO adjudication are slow, and particularly congested at the moment, with a record number of disputes working through the system.   The defendants in the disputes can reject the adjudication requests at the Oct. 29 meeting but would have to accept them at the November meeting.  Then a search for adjudicators will begin. Once they are appointed, which will take months more, they may take two years or more to report on the disputes.   The sides can then appeal, but the United States is threatening to cripple the WTO appeals system by blocking the appointment of judges.

975,975,24-06-18 17:49,2018,6,24,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,Westworld season 2 review: am I watching this show wrong?,"Many weeks, after my recap of Westworld posts on Sunday nights, I hear from readers. Sometimes, those readers want to correct something I’ve gotten wrong, which is always welcome. But sometimes, those corrections aren’t actually correcting anything — they’re more trying to win me over to their theory of what the Man in Black is up to, or what Westworld is supposed to be, or which planet the series takes place on. “You missed...” these emails and tweets will often start, before launching into several paragraphs of explanation of how some tiny detail in the costume or production design reveals the truth about the Delos Corporation’s secret plans or what have you. But I don’t know that I “missed” anything, so much as I don’t share these particular readers’ theories about what’s going to happen. I tend to let the show present things to me as they happen, rather than trying to guess where it’s going. It’s just how I’m wired. I want to be clear: I’m not complaining about this. I love hearing from readers about anything I write. But the sheer number of these responses has made me think that I might be watching Westworld all wrong — or, perhaps, that it’s such a thin, thematically empty show that the only meaning it has comes from that which you bring to it. But is that on the show? Or is it on me? The feeling I often get from watching Westworld season two — which I should state that I have mostly enjoyed as a viewing experience — is that of HBO offering a spin not on Lost, the ABC drama that from 2004 to 2010 provided a similarly deep and compelling mythology for fans to spend endless time theorizing about, but on the famous Lost recaps of Entertainment Weekly’s Jeff Jensen. Jensen picked apart Lost methodically, digging deep into everything onscreen, in hopes of figuring the show out, of finding a grand, unifying theory of what was going on that would become the show’s ultimate explanation. This was a key part of watching Lost for many, many viewers. Trying to figure out how all of the pieces fit together by hashing out the clues with your friends online became almost a bigger pastime than watching the show itself, to the degree that many series ABC aired in the time slot after Lost struggled in the ratings because so much of the fan base immediately turned to the computer to talk out the most recent episode. Jensen’s recaps became a central hub of that particular Lost experience. But Lost still largely worked as a passive viewing experience. You could be someone completely detached from the show’s mythology and larger questions and still be interested in the adventures of the assorted characters on the Island. And part of the show’s mega-hit ingeniousness stemmed from how those two approaches to watching the series lived parallel to each other until its very end, when the writers had to choose whether to put their emphasis on the character track or the mythology track. (They chose the former, and, uh, it made some people angry.) But because the character track was as strong as it was, Lost has continued to be essential viewing to this day. Now that you know a lot of the show’s biggest questions will receive lackluster, easily predictable, or nonexistent answers, it’s easier to tap into everything else about the show that was brilliant and compelling. So what I mean when I say Westworld feels like an adaptation of a Lost recap is that, for better or worse, it is less a character-driven drama than it is a mystery and mythology-driven drama. Yes, it feints toward giving characters revelatory arcs, and because those characters are played by such great actors, you almost believe them. But the second half of the second season has largely frozen its main characters in place for several episodes, looping and darting through time in a seeming effort to distract from how little is actually going on. It is a show where things are always about to happen, where the characters and the plot all stand on a precipice, waiting for some revelation to give them meaning, in their own eyes and in ours. Take, for instance, the second season’s justifiably acclaimed eighth episode “Kiksuya,” which is the rare episode of the show to be more character-centric than mystery-centric. Focusing on the background character of Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon), part of the mysterious Ghost Nation tribe (a group of robotic Hosts created to resemble Native Americans), “Kiksuya” follows the character’s journey toward consciousness and his attempts to save his now lost love from her imprisonment by those who run Westworld. It’s heartbreaking and melancholic, and it stands as a testament to the idea that Westworld could be a more traditional and straightforward drama if it wanted to be — it maybe just doesn’t want to. What’s more, “Kiksuya” displays most of Westworld’s other tendencies throughout. It’s an hour about Akecheta, sure, but it’s also an hour about using his character to fill in various gaps in the show’s backstory. His character’s goals aren’t particularly deep (he wants to find his lost love), and his psychological journey, while interesting, doesn’t rise to the level of genuinely compelling. Instead, he goes on a guided tour of seeming plot holes in order to close them up. Much of the dialogue in the hour takes the form of a lengthy monologue from Akecheta that mostly tells us things that happened, rather than filling in who he is. None of this is meant to be a complaint. “Kiksuya” very evidently works on its own terms, and it doesn’t need to work on the terms of other, more traditional TV dramas to be effective. But it helped me understand why I can find Westworld interesting and engaging, but rarely deep, compelling, or insightful. In the absence of a more traditional narrative, the show largely exists as possibility space, as a canvas the viewer is invited to sketch their own thoughts onto. Creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have provided a series of suggested lines to color within, but you are simultaneously invited to color outside of them, to let your crayons mark up the floor, or to burn the book entirely. Or, put another way, most TV shows try to meet the viewer halfway; Westworld asks if you can come over to its place, then asks you to help it move. This is appropriate, in some ways. On its most basic level, the “story” of Westworld involves a bunch of video game characters realizing they’re video game characters. And like a video game, Westworld requires a “player” to become its best possible self. You can watch it passively, trying to engage with it on the basis of its characters or plot, but even there, the show throws up roadblocks to interpreting it as anything other than a puzzle. Why, for instance, is season two told out of narrative sequence, other than an insistence on the part of the show that you should have to do at least a little work to enjoy it? I vacillate on whether this need for a “player” makes Westworld brilliant or bullshit. Most of the show’s ideas about philosophy, religion, psychology, and technology are half-assed and better expressed in other science-fiction texts (like, say, the Battlestar Galactica remake, the Blade Runner films, or basically any Neal Stephenson novel). But inviting viewers into the show’s own creative process and asking us to help complete the half-finished picture means that the show can never be entirely pinned down, which is exciting in its own way. It not only gives the impression that it’s about to do something brilliant, which will imbue it with deeper meaning, but that you might be the one to reveal the cornerstone that gives shape to the whole structure. And yet most of the revelations the show has hidden from viewers have been easily guessed by its most dedicated fans, and once they’ve been revealed, they accomplish very little. They exist solely to keep mystery flowing. Westworld, then, is best understood as a show about being the TV show Westworld. It devours itself in ever more intricate, ever more metatextual circles, and subscribing to the show’s subreddit feels not like a fun value-add but like something that’s compulsory. It’s smart and not smart simultaneously, meaningful and empty within the same shot. I sometimes think about pointing at it and shouting that it’s naked, but then, in my mind’s eye, I see the most beautiful robe. Westworld’s second season ends Sunday on HBO at 9 pm Eastern, with a special 90-minute episode.",https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/22/17489862/westworld-season-2-review-finale-recap-the-passenger,,Vox
976,976,25-01-17 20:31,2017,1,25,Allison Tierney,What Would Happen if All Drugs Were Legal in Canada?,"The opioid crisis has claimed thousands of lives since its onset in Canada several years ago, and recently, a Vancouver MP brought up a conversation about the necessity for the country to consider legalizing drugs in order to address growing public health concerns around overdose deaths.  ""I think we are at the point, as a country, where we can start opening a dialogue about finding a better method of distributing drugs, legally, to those who are addicted to them so that we can avoid the unnecessary death, destruction, and crime that is so clearly associated with the current model [prohibition],"" Don Davies, the NDP MP for Vancouver Kingsway, told the  Georgia Straight.  Trudeau has promised Canadians legalization of weed, which won't happen until 2018 most likely. If that is successful, there could be calls for further legalization of drugs as public attitudes soften.  But what would happen if Canada legalized drugs other than marijuana? We have seen full decriminalization, all the way from weed to heroin, in Portugal—but legalization is another concept entirely. Bill Bogart, who wrote the book  Off the Street, which called for national discussion in Canada of this very topic, said that simply decriminalizing drugs only treats one side of the equation—it does not address drug-supply issues.  ""There's no quality assurance of what is being sold [with just decriminalization], so in an illicit market, people can be sold tainted substances that can make them sick or even kill them,"" Bogart said. ""If we legalize and regulate, people would know what's in them, how potent they are, etc."" That reasoning is why legalization would need to be considered over simply decriminalization if Canada would want to use it as a way to remedy the destruction bootleg fentanyl has caused. By legalizing and regulating, the government could better ensure that substances people are consuming are not tainted, leading to a decrease in overdoses and deaths.  When it comes to legalization in Canada, however, a single country ending prohibition would have little effect on the illicit-drug market globally, including inhumane conditions in which drugs such as cocaine are produced. As Bogart said, an international effort toward ending prohibition would be necessary if we hope to address those kinds of problems.  ""One of the central goals in legalization and regulation is to get rid of the misery that prohibition has caused… It's generated an illicit market run by the lawless; if we legalize and regulate, we'll confront that kind of market.""  But what could happen in Canada to criminal organizations in control of the drug trade here if we ended prohibition?  ""Just because we legalize and regulate, it doesn't mean the illicit market will disappear the next day,"" Bogart said. ""It will be driven out, and the object is to completely destroy it, but it will take time. Whatever portion of the market remains illicit, by definition, it's not being taxed."" READ MORE: What Would Happen in the Minutes and Hours After the US Invaded Canada?  That taxation is a major benefit to legalizing drugs, Bogart said, and soon we will get to witness firsthand a case study in what that looks like once we see the prohibition of marijuana in Canada officially end. The weed industry alone in Canada could have a value in the billions of dollars—if we considered legalizing other currently illicit drugs, the kind of revenue that would create could equal out to be a ridiculously huge amount of money.   ""It's hard to quantify; because it is an illicit market, we don't have any good figures… It's certainly [at least] a billion-dollar industry.""  We could see other drugs—like magic mushrooms and cocaine—sold in dispensaries like weed. But, Bogart said, we are more likely to see legalization in waves, meaning single substances made legal in phases over time. Though he is for legalization, Bogart said he doesn't think it will or should be done all at once.  An additional benefit to taxing drugs in addition to marijuana, Bogart said, is that it is a form of harm reduction. The cost associated could impact our consumption.   ""We'll take the money we've spent on the criminal justice system and on the enforcement system, and use it to build a system of regulation, one aspect of which is harm reduction… The message would be become, 'Well, we're not going to put you in jail for this, but that doesn't mean drugs are harmless."" Ending prohibition, Bogart said, would have a significant impact on decreasing our prison population in Canada. And harm reduction, ideally, would become embedded in our education system in order to educate children from a young age about the effects of different kinds of drug use.  However, the stigma and stereotypes rooted in the war-on-drugs mentality will take time to shift. ""Attitudes and norms can change; we mustn't despair of them never changing,"" Bogart said. ""Marijuana will get to the same place as alcohol… We could develop corresponding attitudes toward other drugs, [such as accepting] cocaine use in a way where there's no sign of dependence and you use it occasionally.""  Bogart believes the opioid crisis has reignited the important conversation on ending prohibition of substances other than marijuana in Canada, but that ""there's so many factors at play here. If Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions decide they are going to be drug warriors, this whole evolution is going to be enormously impeded.""

982,982,25-03-16 21:30,2016,3,25,Diana Tourjée ,Segregation and Cum-Filled Boots: The Story of Women in the Civil Rights Act,"Gillian Thomas, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Women's Rights Project (WRP) and author of the recently acclaimed book Because of Sex: One Law, Ten Cases, and Fifty Years That Changed American Women's Lives at Work, thinks that it is important for young women to know about the historical precedents that have been set which allow them legal protection for gender discrimination. This is why, in her book, Thomas chronicles court cases crucial to Title VII, and in doing so, illustrates the decision's enduring achievement. Detailing these cases—a woman who was denied the right to work in a factory because she had small children, a pair of young women who fought together for their right to be employed as a state patroller and prison guard, respectively—humanizes those who were a part of the fight for equality. According to Thomas, the cases in her book (and the stories of the women behind them) are far more important than one might think. ""[They're] why we now all have sexual harassment policies at work: Because one woman got a lawyer and her case ended up at the Supreme Court."" The cases that Thomas illustrates are from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but, as an attorney, she works on comparable cases today. Until recently, she was employed by Legal Momentum in New York City (formerly the Legal Women's Defense and Education Fund) where she fought for the rights of women working in traditionally male dominated fields, such as firefighting and construction. ""As you can imagine, those places are extremely hostile to women,"" Thomas said, adding that hostility towards women in these fields primarily manifests as more overt sexual harassment (and differs from the potentially more inconspicuous sexism women may face in office settings, for example). She related several anecdotes from her time trying these contemporary cases, which encompass things like hardcore pornography being left out in the open, the name or picture of a female employee being placed beside obscene graffiti, and women being forced to endure sexual propositions and groping on the job: ""A lot of the harassment takes on a primitive or animalistic nature,"" Thomas explained, adding that one of her client's tools was soaked in urine. ""I heard from a lot of [female] firefighters who, going to put on their boots or their gloves, would find feces inside of them or semen inside of them,"" she said. All of this, Thomas told me, is a way for men to communicate that ""women are not welcome here."" Title VII allowed Thomas to make legal cases against this form of harassment, something that would not be possible had women not set the precedent decades ago. However, while Title VII was an unprecedented achievement for women, ""sex"" was only added late in the bill's development, something for which we have America's enduring legacy of anti-Black racism to thank. Thomas writes in the opening of Because of Sex: ""Today, most American women would probably be surprised to know that they have an unrepentantly racist, male octogenarian to thank for outlawing sex bias on the job."" Title VII, which was about to be made into law, did not include protections for sex, which disturbed a ""segregationist congressman"" named Howard Smith. ""[He] figured if it was going to pass he wanted women to be protected,"" Thomas said, adding he wanted to protect ""white women specifically because black women, in theory, were protected by virtue of their race."" So, because a racist congressman didn't want Black people to have more rights than white women, sex became part of Title VII's protections. ""Title VII is kind of the monster law from which all of our rights stem."" Thomas said. ""There's also the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act—those were modeled on Title VII."" All of this history, however compelling, is scarcely known, she explains. On Thursday night, Thomas discussed her book with senior editor at Slate and TV pundit Dahlia Lithwick, at the ACLU national headquarters in Manhattan. Former college roommates at Yale University, Thomas and Lithwick bounced off each other in front of a room of mostly women, summarizing Thomas' text. Lithwick, noting the gender disparity in the room, highlighted that ""men are educable"" and Thomas, showing off her deep, detailed understanding of how women's rights are fought for, sped through Title VII's history s with a slideshow, underscoring the significance of it all for women today. ""Yes, I use these laws when I litigate cases, but I also benefit from them when I sit in my office and attend meetings with male coworkers and know that I'm not going to be leered at,"" Thomas said. She realizes that many young women are not aware, or consciously grateful of, the work women of older generations have done to secure their rights today. Part of the problem is that the history itself is not immediately accessible, which is partially why she wrote Because of Sex. ""My hostility comes in if there's willful blindness or lack of curiosity rather than just not being aware of it in the first place,"" Thomas said.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypaywg/segregation-and-cum-filled-boots-the-story-of-women-in-the-civil-rights-act,Identity,Vice

984,984,03-09-16 15:00,2016,9,3,Emily Todd VanDerWerff,Morgan starts as a nicely creepy sci-fi tale. Then everything goes horribly wrong.,"It’s rare to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when a movie goes wrong, but it’s possible to do so with Morgan, the new sci-fi horror film from director Luke Scott (the son of Ridley). Rating For roughly its first two-thirds, Morgan is a deeply intriguing movie with one question at its center: Did Morgan, an artificial life form played by Anya Taylor-Joy (whom you may remember as the protagonist of The Witch), harm one of the scientists caring for her because she’s been constructed incorrectly and is, thus, inherently violent? Or did she harm the scientist because she suffered a glitch? Yes, this premise is pretty similar to that of the terrific 2015 robot drama Ex Machina — also about an attempt to determine just how ""human"" an artificial human really was — but Morgan offers a family dynamic among Morgan and the many scientists caring for her that Ex Machina didn’t have. In essence, the film asks, is it okay for the corporation that technically owns Morgan to kill someone these people think of as family, even if she’s dangerous to them? That’s a fun little sci-fi puzzle, as these things go. You can imagine the potential Twilight Zone episode that might have resulted — right down to the twist that also ends the film (which I’m going to spoil below, so be forewarned). But pulling off such a story requires a certain degree of thoughtfulness, and whatever thoughtfulness Morgan starts out with disappears as the film enters its final half-hour. And now let the spoilers begin. Around Morgan’s halfway point, a major new character enters the story. As the psychologist tasked with evaluating Morgan’s mental workings, Paul Giamatti is at his rumpled best, irritated with the thought that he’s been brought all the way out to a farm in the middle of nowhere to talk to a robot. But his opinion of Morgan will be key. If he says she’s fine, she’ll be allowed to live. If he deems her a threat, the scientists will be forced to put her to sleep. (A corporate hired gun, played by Kate Mara, is on site to make sure they do what they’re told.) Giamatti only appears in this one sequence, but it’s an impressive one. He begins talking to Morgan like he wants to be her friend, then slowly turns up the heat, until he’s all but daring her to hurt him, just as she hurt the other scientist. And in the end, she does, ultimately leading to the decision to terminate her. It doesn’t go all that well — Morgan becomes a horror movie villain and starts killing everyone, while Mara tries to kill Morgan instead. The problem is that until this point, the film has been toying with ideas about whether Morgan is an actual sentient being, whether she deserves the same sort of rights that a human being might have — which would not include having essentially no autonomy and/or being the property of a corporation. However, it largely tosses those aside in favor of the ""everybody dies"" ending. It briefly suggests that Morgan was baited by the psychologist, that she realized she was an entirely separate species and, necessarily, must be at war with her creators. But it invests too little effort in exploring this idea, instead favoring random bursts of violence and splatter. This is too bad, because the movie’s early going is frequently intriguing. And it’s filmed beautifully by Scott, who’s particularly fond of shots featuring the overlapping reflections of various characters as they talk to each other through glass barriers, an effect that allows for both eerie and surprisingly erotic moments. But the pivot into full horror ultimately undercuts everything else Morgan was going for. Morgan ceases to be an intriguing philosophical quandary when she’s actively working to kill every human she meets. The film’s twist ending (which reveals that Mara is also a robot — something you could see coming after reading the film’s premise) tries to raise further issues of artificial intelligence and whether humanity might invent a successor that would cause humanity’s extinction. But it’s all too little, too late. Morgan starts out as an intriguing puzzle for the mind, but it ends up as a generic haunted house tale. At least Ex Machina built to a similarly horrifying conclusion much more organically — and in a way that acknowledged the moral complexity of the situation. Morgan mostly offers a blood-spattered shrug.",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/3/12760836/morgan-review-horror-movie-scary,,Vox

The founder of The Wirecutter, Brian Lam, says a lot of other media companies have that formula backward. ""A lot of these new companies, the mission is business: ‘We want to get as many eyeballs as possible,’"" Lam said. ""It’s not, ‘This is what we believe and this is what we’re going to write about and this is how we’re going to help people.’"" Coming from a journalistic background at Wired and Gizmodo, Lam argued on the latest Recode Media with Peter Kafka that online media companies have to chase both quality and revenue. He predicted that whatever his company does next — possibly branching out into fashion recommendations — it will have to be based on emphasizing utility to the reader. ""We’re not going to do it because it’s a business opportunity,"" Lam said of the potential fashion vertical. ""We’re going to do it because we think we can be helpful, and there’s also a business opportunity. The business serves what we’re trying to build."" When he was building up The Wirecutter’s staff, Lam explained, none of the business-minded applicants who came in for interviews understood the balance he wanted to strike. ""Everyone thinks the point of our existence is to hit this level of scale or profitability or these very important metrics that are metrics,"" Lam said. ""They’re not the point. The point isn’t to live till 80, it’s to have a good life until 80."" ""Interviewing business people, I always set this trap,"" he added. ""I was like, ‘How big do you think we can get? The number didn’t matter, I didn’t even listen to the number sometimes. And I was like, ‘How do you think we’d get there?’ They’d have these ridiculous answers. It’s unbelievable how many people don’t get it on the business side of media."" Which raises the question: Rhetorics aside, what’s so wrong about a company that focuses on making money? Lam acknowledged that some of his competitors are ""much bigger"" for having followed that path, but questioned one unnamed competitor in particular as hurting itself and its customers in the long term. ""Their people are fleeing,"" he said. ""We’ve had people from this particular company tell us, their business people there, tell us that they wouldn’t trust their own content to buy things from. It’s like, ‘Wow. You’re peddling this on the world?’ And you know what? Within a couple years, they’ve started to crater.

987,987,04-04-18 00:00,2018,4,4,"Ana Mano, Roberto Samora",Brazil soy exporters set to win big from U.S.-China trade spat,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - China’s move to slap tariffs on U.S. farm products sent Brazil soy premiums surging to historic highs on expectations of higher export demand on Wednesday, but traders and analysts warned that Latin America could not entirely replace U.S. production.  China responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to impose $50 billion in tariffs on its goods by announcing tariffs of equal value on U.S. imports, including a wide range of agricultural products.  Goods produced in South America made the list, including soy, beef, tobacco, cotton and frozen orange juice.  That raised the prospect that China would seek to shift large parts of its agricultural sourcing from the United States to the region. Alternate global suppliers of goods ranging from televisions to vaccines could be unexpected beneficiaries of Trump’s policies.  Already record high premiums for Brazilian soy over Chicago prices were driven up 37 percent in response, the biggest one-day increase since January 2017.   “I have never seen a premium this high in history, this in a way will more than compensate for the bloodbath in Chicago,” said Aedson Pereira, an analyst at IEG-FNP, a subsidiary of Informa Economics.  Chicago soybeans futures contracts for May delivery fell 2 percent, closing at around $10.15 per bushel, retracing some losses after a 5 percent plunge.  But Latin America does not produce enough to compensate fully for U.S. output - and that may help push China and the United States to settle the dispute, according to Pereira and other analysts.  Brazil already sells roughly 75 percent of its soybean exports to China and with increasing domestic demand is unlikely to be able to free up much more for export.  “Even if Brazil sells its entire export volume to China, the Asian country would be short of 30 million tonnes,” said one Brazil-based analyst, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.  South America’s other top producer Argentina already sent almost 90 percent of its 7.3 million soybeans to China last year, while smaller Paraguay does not have diplomatic relations with China.  The outlook for soybean prices was already robust after Argentina supplies took a hit from drought, while China’s demand has continued to rise.  Rodrigo Oliveira, chief strategist of Agro Financeira, a small trading and hedging firm based in the state of Tocantins, said his firm was looking to take advantage, buying up more Brazilian soybeans compared to last year.  “When China is going to buy from Brazilian trading (firms), they will have to pay us the Brazilian premium,” said Oliveira. “This is going to be huge for Brazilian soybean prices.”  Reporting by Ana Mano and Roberto Samora; Additional reporting  by Maximilian Heath and Nicolas Misculin in BUENOS AIRES, Daniela Desantis in ASUNCION, Karl Plume in CHICAGO and Jose Roberto Gomes in SAO PAULO; Writing by Jake Spring, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-latin-america/brazil-soy-exporters-set-to-win-big-from-u-s-china-trade-spat-idUSKCN1HB2XK,Business News,Reuters

The Parkland students have since used that spotlight to broaden their coalition with a 20-state bus tour aimed at registering new voters and electing politicians that will enact gun-reform legislation.

This month, Tim brings offerings from Swan River to Cook Islands, and everywhere in between. Few things bring me more joy than an email notification about a new Mei Saraswati release dropping on Bandcamp. Field recordings of Swan River water creatures and marshes meld with surprising harmonies and minimalist soul rhythms. This is experimental soul music. As always with Mei, the naive vibe here can't quite completely mask her astonishing vocal talent. This gorgeous piece of sound collage from Sydney multi-instrumentalist Jacques Emery breathes rarified air. There are some sublimely tender moments here amongst the dreamlike sound design - which makes sense as apparently these songs are love songs. Vocal experimentation, pianos & treated ambiences collide, recalling Feels-era Animal Collective in places. Putting big empty spaces in your music takes courage. Melbourne composer Donald U'Ren expertly weaves the sounds of Rarotonga island life (recorded during a Uni trip to the Cook Islands) into a rich and minimal sonic adventure. The funk experiments of Hiatus Kaiyote affiliate Matthew Kirkis continue to be guided solely by their own alien logic, leaving us with fragmented beats that are only barely penetrable by us mere humans. Like with most of his work, I find myself listening to ""Cold Crush"" over and over in some effort to acclimatise to its strangeness, only to at some point coil away from it, scared of losing myself forever in it's labyrinthine rhythmic logic. Felicity Yang's constructions are becoming increasingly complex, and though there's definitely an implied volatility here given the sheer number of elements in play - so many moving parts - its still as delicate as ever. Oscar here feels like a planet; Felicity launches a collection of sounds into orbit around his voice with the precision of a NASA controller, clearing room for the trajectory of every sound, avoiding any and every possible collision. From the ground, an artificial constellation forms. Making ambient music in 2016 is not hard - a laptop mic, a free download of PaulStretch, and a SoundCloud account, and you're most of the way towards making that Fennesz record you've always wanted. Except you're not. It still takes a special someone—with keen ears, great taste and, most importantly, a beating human heart—to elevate signal processing past just a soulless technical exercise. The new EP from Perth's Tourist Kid does just this: yes, it's a conceptual record focused on ""cultivating spacial awareness"" but it's also a human expression of feelings, a rich collection of frozen emotions. This collaborative project brings together long-time friends Harvey Sutherland and Kane Ikin for an EP of textured dance music that is actually less than the sum of its parts. Both collaborators have excised part of their modus operandi in the service of each beat—there's no room here for Harvey Sutherland's fruitier side, and Kane Ikin's noisy textures are more focused, and less cerebral, than usual. Sometimes subtraction is the key. Young Sydney duo IljusWifmo execute rubbery club music with precision, tempering dark energy with playful rhythmic trickery. Their debut EP has been released by a Romanian record label which is great for them, as they are on the record as wanting to ""move to Europe"". Sad face emoji. Fallopian Tunes strikes again, with a precisely rendered collection of shambolic beats from Melbourne producer Exotic Snake, who, for some reason, I keep wanting to call Erotic Snake. We now have a fittingly stark video for this paranoid techno banger from Melbourne producer Elisabeth Dixon. Keep your eyes out for a proper release of this one soon. - Tim Shiel is a Melbourne-based musician and radio broadcaster who currently hosts the Double J and triple j program Something More.
